Since the early 1960's, Six Flags has grown to become the world's largest theme park company, at one point, operating over 37 parks around the world. Their parks were beloved from their original property, Six Flags Over Texas, to others like Magic Mountain and Great Adventure. But after a series of terrible decisions, the company failed to make even the slightest profit and ultimately declared bankruptcy. In doing so, they left parks demolished or abandoned in their wake. Join me today as I find out why.
