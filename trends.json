NASA is targeting Wednesday, Nov. 16, for the launch of the Artemis I Moon mission during a two-hour launch window that opens at 1:04 a.m. EST (0604 UTC). During #Artemis I, Orion will lift off aboard the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and travel 280,000 miles (450,000 km) from Earth and 40,000 miles (64,000 km) beyond the far side of the Moon, carrying science and technology payloads to expand our understanding of lunar science, technology developments, and deep space radiation.  \n\nThrough Artemis missions, NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon, paving the way for a long-term lunar presence and serving as a steppingstone to send astronauts to Mars.

That‚Äôs why I was absolutely stoked when I got a call from none other than Karl Jacobs asking me if I could build him a giant computer so that he could beat Minecraft on it. You see I have a habit of building the most insane builds on YouTube like transforming my bedroom into a cereal bowl, building Squid Game doll for MrBeast, and building giant boxing gloves for Jake Paul. That‚Äôs why it was a no brainer for me to not only make Karl a giant computer, but to make him the WORLD‚ÄôS LARGEST computer! if you don‚Äôt know Karl he is the largest gaming creator in the world, largest Twitch streamer, and a main character in many MrBeast videos. This project was absolutely insane to make and we definetly bit off more than we could chew, but it turned out amazing in the end and Karl‚Äôs reaction was priceless.

We ran our first test piece early because we were at a stage where we needed more cables from viewers -- we got some! With the help of our audience sending in a few failed cables, we were able to reach 3 firm conclusions (or, really, 2+1) of causes for failures of these adapter cables (and unadapted ones, too). Of course, there may be even more reasons -- but we believe these 3 to be the primary ones. Between foreign object debris in manufacturing (seems uncommon, but a cause) and user error, we were able to make a few cables melt. On the user error front, remember one key thing: Even if yours doesn't start fully unseated and is only partly unseated, it can work its way loose over time if you move cables around, do some cleanup, move the system, etc.\n\nWatch our first video in this series! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIKjZ1djp8c\n\nNew GN 3D Coaster Pack: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-drink-debug-coaster-pack-4-custom-3d-coasters-100x100mm-4x4\nGN PC Building Anti-Static Modmat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat-volt-large\nGN Red & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-red-black-hud-mouse-mat\nGN Blue & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-wireframe-mouse-mat\n\r\nLike our content?

And starring alongside \nTatum is Salma Hayek Pinault (‚ÄúHouse of Gucci,‚Äù ‚ÄúHitman‚Äôs Wife‚Äôs Bodyguard‚Äù).\n‚ÄúMagic‚Äù Mike Lane (Tatum) takes to the stage again after a lengthy hiatus, \nfollowing a business deal that went bust, leaving him broke and taking \nbartender gigs in Florida. For what he hopes will be one last hurrah, Mike heads \nto London with a wealthy socialite (Hayek Pinault) who lures him with an offer he \ncan‚Äôt refuse‚Ä¶and an agenda all her own. With everything on the line, once Mike \ndiscovers what she truly has in mind, will he‚Äîand the roster of hot new dancers \nhe‚Äôll have to whip into shape‚Äîbe able to pull it off?\nThe film‚Äôs producers are Nick Wechsler, Gregory Jacobs, Tatum, Carolin and \nPeter Kiernan. Julie M. Anderson serves as executive producer.\nAlso starring with Tatum and Hayek Pinault are Ayub Khan Din (‚ÄúAckley \nBridge‚Äù), newcomer Jemelia George, Juliette Motamed (‚ÄúWe Are Lady Parts‚Äù) \nand Vicki Pepperdine (‚ÄúJohnny English Strikes Again‚Äù).\nSoderbergh‚Äôs creative team behind the scenes includes production \ndesigner Pat Campbell (‚ÄúThe Bastard Son & The Devil Himself‚Äù), costume designer \nChristopher Peterson (‚ÄúThe Irishman‚Äù) and music supervisor Season Kent (‚ÄúKIMI,‚Äù \n‚ÄúLet Them All Talk‚Äù), with choreography by Alison Faulk and Luke Broadlick, both \npart of the ‚ÄúMagic Mike‚Äù franchise.\nA Warner Bros.

{"description":"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - Only In Theaters this Christmas\n\nThis holiday season, everyone‚Äôs favorite leche-loving, swashbuckling, fear-defying feline returns.  \n\nFor the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. \n\nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Softpaws (Oscar¬Æ nominee Salma Hayek Pinault). \n\nIn their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided‚Äîagainst their better judgment‚Äîby a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perrito (Harvey Guill√©n, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldi (Oscar¬Æ nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, the big, bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).\n \nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish features an all-star comedic cast that includes Oscar¬Æ winner Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone (Black Widow), Samson Kayo (Sliced), Emmy nominee Anthony Mendez (Jane the Virgin) and Tony nominee Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Trolls World Tour).  \n \nThe long-awaited follow-up to the 2011 Academy Award¬Æ-nominated blockbuster, The Last Wish is directed by Joel Crawford and produced by Mark Swift, the creative team behind DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs smash, The Croods: A New Age. The film‚Äôs executive producer is Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri. \n \nThe character of Puss in Boots first appeared in 2004‚Äôs Oscar¬Æ-nominated Shrek 2 and instantly became a global, scene-stealing sensation. Puss then co-starred in two other Shrek sequels and his solo film, as well as in multiple DreamWorks Animation videos and TV series. The Shrek and Puss in Boots films have collectively earned more than $3.5 billion worldwide. \n\nSocial Handles\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pussinboots \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Dreamworks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pussinboots  \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@pussinboots\nWebsite: https://www.PussInBootsMovie.com \n#PussInBoots","title":"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - Official Trailer 3","duration":177,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20221115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHb7WlgyaUc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tHb7WlgyaUc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":8487783}}
