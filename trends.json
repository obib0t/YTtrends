{"description":"An out-of-this-world teaser trailer for Disney and Pixar’s 28th feature film, “Elio,” are now available. Additions to the voice cast include: Jameela Jamil and Brad Garrett join previously announced America Ferrera and Yonas Kibreab in the intergalactic misadventure that is scheduled to take off next spring—March 1, 2024.\n \nFor centuries, people have called out to the universe looking for answers—in Disney and Pixar’s all-new movie “Elio,” the universe calls back! The original feature film introduces Elio, an underdog with an active imagination who finds himself inadvertently beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. Mistakenly identified as Earth’s ambassador to the rest of the universe, and completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be. \n \nDirected by Adrian Molina (screenwriter and co-director of “Coco”) and produced by Mary Alice Drumm (associate producer of “Coco”), the film features the voices of America Ferrera as Elio’s mom, Olga; Jameela Jamil as Ambassador Questa; Brad Garrett as Ambassador Grigon; and Yonas Kibreab as the title character. “Elio” releases in theaters March 1, 2024.\n\nFacebook:  https://Facebook.com/Pixar\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/pixar\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pixar","title":"Elio | Teaser Trailer","duration":129,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20230613","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w_K3CB8PuE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2w_K3CB8PuE/hqdefault.jpg?v=648892cb","content":{"View count":2157355}}

Written and directed by Academy Award® nominee and Emmy® Award winner Bob Peterson and produced by Kim Collins, “Carl’s Date” goes home with Carl Fredricksen (voice of Ed Asner) and his lovable talking dog, Dug (voice of Peterson), who were introduced in Pixar’s Oscar®-winning feature “Up.” Moviegoers will catch up with Carl as he reluctantly agrees to go on a date with a lady friend—but admittedly has no idea how dating works these days. Ever the helpful friend, Dug steps in to calm Carl’s pre-date jitters and offer some tried-and-true tips for making friends—if you’re a dog. \n\r\nPixar Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixar/\r\nPixar Twitter: https://twitter.com/pixar\r\nPixar Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pixar\r\n \r\nCopyright: (C) Disney•Pixar","title":"Carl’s Date | Official Trailer","duration":36,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20230612","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5emJgNiFbAA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/5emJgNiFbAA/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":977405}}

{"description":"On the fourth playoff hole of the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Nick Taylor sinks a 72-foot putt for eagle at the par-5 18th hole to defeat Tommy Fleetwood, securing the Canadian native’s third win of his PGA TOUR career.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nOne week before the U.S Open, the PGA TOUR heads to Oakdale Golf & Country Club in Canada for the RBC Canadian Open. About to turn 100 years old, Oakdale will be hosting Canada’s national championship for the first time. Rory McIlroy headlines the field and will be looking to build on his T7 finish at the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday last week. As a two-time defending champion of the tournament, the Northern Irishman will be the man to beat. Tyrrell Hatton enters the tournament in strong form after finishing in the top 20 in five consecutive events since the RBC Heritage in April. Matt Fitzpatrick will also have a strong chance in Canada this week. Despite an opening-round 76, he finished T9 at Muirfield Village Golf Club, five shots off the lead. He’ll look to stay hot this week in preparation for his U.S Open title defense. Expectations are high for Corey Conners.

Mother and father are surprisingly receptive, and before long, a long haired, mini red dachshund named Delilah has arrived at their home!\n\nOakley is thrilled at first, as he now has a #cute little dachshund puppy to keep him company; to wrestle with... to chase.. to cuddle with.

Dempsey's triumph heralded a new era in his illustrious career, and Anderson expects to do the same in his first headlining attraction.\n \nIn the 10-round heavyweight co-feature, Montreal-based wrecking ball Arslanbek Makhmudov takes on Nigeria’s Raphael Akpejiori.

The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.\n\nSubscribe to DisneyMusicVEVO 🔔 for all the latest Disney music videos: https://www.youtube.com/@DisneyMusicVEVO?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Disney Music: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic\n\nMusic video by Halle performing Part of Your World (From \"The Little Mermaid\"). © 2023 Walt Disney Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/j1wPSQ","title":"Halle - Part of Your World (From \"The Little Mermaid\")","duration":215,"channel_id":"UCgwv23FVv3lqh567yagXfNg","author":"DisneyMusicVEVO","date":"20230609","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf7Dss2gCe0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kf7Dss2gCe0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2049902}}

{"description":"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nNikki Birch | June 9, 2023\nI was working late when Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds first arrived at the office to rehearse for his Tiny Desk concert. Within moments, it was clear it would be an exceptional performance. The next day, my colleagues waited patiently to see the legendary singer, songwriter and producer. Because when it comes to matters of the heart, Babyface has turned our angst, our triumphs, our devastation, into timeless love songs that have scored the romances of more than one generation.\n\nJoined by top-tier talent — Tank, Chanté Moore and Avery Wilson — Babyface came out swinging. From the songs that put him on the map, to those he wrote or produced for other icons, around the room hit after hit was met with swoons, sighs and not a few tears. (Ok, maybe that was just me.)\n\nBabyface is a titan of the music industry: with numerous top 10 hits, 12 Grammys (50 nominations) and a jaw-dropping roster of collaborations. In 2022, he assembled a stellar ensemble of women for one of my favorite albums of the year, Girls Night Out. To watch this master of pen and sound behind the Tiny Desk was truly epic and nothing short of a dream come true.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Two Occasions\"\n\"Whip Appeal\"\n\"Superwoman\"\n\"Take A Bow\"\n\"Not Gon' Cry\"\n\"Can We Talk\"\n\"Change the World\"\n\"Thnks fr th Mmrs\"\n\"I'll Make Love To You\"\n\"End Of The Road\"\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds: vocals, keys, guitar \nErskine Hawkins III: keys, music director\nAntoine Porter: guitar \nWalt Barnes Jr.: bass\nReggie Regg: drums \nTank: vocals \nChanté Moore: vocals \nAvery Wilson: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter \nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna \nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #babyface","title":"Babyface: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1782,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230609","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eHc0Xz_Hio","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3eHc0Xz_Hio/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1224928}}

{"description":"Disney World really is a kingdom.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nHave you ever wondered why Disney World is located where it is? Or how it came to be such a massive, self-contained universe? It’s a story that involves secret land deals, special districts, and, now, a corporation and a government locked in a feud.\n\nThe story of why Disney World is in Florida marries business and governmental concerns about the creation of the massive property. The engineering ranges from unique physical construction (like the creation of a lake) to unique legal construction (like the creation of a self-running government that could even build its own sewer system).\n\nFurther Reading:\nBuying Disney’s World (https://www.amazon.com/Buying-Disneys-World-Florida-Swampland/dp/1733642056) by Aaron H. Goldberg is an authoritative work about the purchase of Disney. Drawing from corporate records, internal histories, and more, it’s a comprehensive narrative about Disney World’s creation and early years.\n\nThere are a lot of great Disney fan websites out there that are obsessive in their Disney coverage. I found Jim Hill’s history of Reedy Creek to be a good intro to the topic. (https://jimhillmedia.com/history-reedy-creek-improvement-district-part-1/)\n\nDisney news is also vibrant on YouTube. Mickey Views provides good perspective on the current battles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MickeyViews/videos\n\nFor the latest news and updates about the DeSantis-Disney conflict: bit.ly/3oOHz75\n\nVox is an explanatory newsroom on a mission to help everyone understand our weird, wonderful, complicated world, so that we can all help shape it.

{"description":"3D printed speakers can sound so good! Ad: Get an exclusive NordVPN deal here\nhttps://nordvpn.com/diyperksvpn it’s risk-free with Nord’s 30-day money-back \nguarantee!\n\nWant to build these speakers for your own gaming or TV setup? The 3D printable files are available for $29.99 - https://payhip.com/b/dhJrS\n\nParts list:\n(Note that some links may earn me a commission if you purchase an item through them)\nIt's approx $500 to build a pair (so $250 per speaker), which is good value when you think that a Sonos or Bose will set you back at least that much only instead of getting a single unit you get a stereo pair with better audio quality to boot!\n\nSubwoofer: Tang Band W3-1876S\nUSA:  https://www.parts-express.com/Tang-Band-W3-1876S-3-Mini-Subwoofer-264-909\nEU: https://rkn3.net/c/?si=14570&li=1627332&wi=363790&dl=en%2Ftang-band-w3-1876s.html\n\nMidtone Driver: Tang Band W3-1364SA\nUSA: https://www.parts-express.com/Tang-Band-W3-1364SA-3-Bamboo-Cone-Driver-264-844\nEU: https://rkn3.net/c/?si=14570&li=1627332&wi=363790&dl=en%2Ftang-band-w3-1364sa.html\n\nAlternative mid drivers (these performed similarly and fit the enclosure):\nhttps://www.parts-express.com/Tang-Band-W3-2141-3-Paper-Cone-Full-Range-Driver-8-Ohm-264-956\nhttps://www.parts-express.com/Tang-Band-W3-1797S-3-Neodymium-Midrange-Driver-264-888\n\nDigital Signal Processor:\nhttps://ebay.us/i8U1fC\n\nAmplifier:\nhttps://ebay.us/ZWlpBh\n\nTWEETERS are optional, as the midtone driver + DSP sounds great on its own, but for the best quality a good budget tweeter is the SB Acoustics SB26STCN, which is my favourite overall due to its pricing, but a premium option is a Scanspeak D2608/913000 Tweeter. It has a bit more ‘sparkle’ and refinement, but this will ONLY be appreciated if the final speakers are given a signal from a high-quality output source like a dedicated DAC.\n\nIf you want to print the baffles, the recommended magnet size is 10mm diameter round neodymium magnets, with 5mm depth maximum.\n\n\nFixtures and fittings:\n\n\n40pcs M3 threaded inserts (for the speaker drivers)\n40pcs 3mm x 8mm countersunk m3 black screws (for the speaker drivers)\n200pcs Self-tapping 2mm diameter screws, 10mm length max (build platform screws)\n24pcs 3mm diameter self-tapping screws (amplifier screws, DSP chamber, midtone chamber base)\n2x step-down voltage regulators, 5v output (for powering the DSP and fan)\n2x 1000uf capacitor (add across the output of the regulator to reduce interference)\n2x Power Adapters (100w ideally, each. A low cost option is old laptop power adapters)\n1x roll of 16awg wire\n\nRecommended glue is CT1 - it sticks to PLA well enough and doesn't set too quickly allowing the whole speaker to be screwed together before it begins to dry. This allows any spill over to be wiped away (use an old brush to get inside the air guide etc). Sets with some amout of flexibility. Readily availabe in the UK but not sure about equivalents for other territories. Visit the Forum or Discord server to see what the community recommends for each region.\n\nSAFETY NOTES ON PLASTER OF PARIS: If you're stupid with it, it can be dangerous. NEVER put your hands/feet/whatever into plaster of paris EVER. It can suddenly set without warning, creating a lot of heat in the center, so you'll get burned or worse. Because of this never leave a batch of wet plaster of paris in reach of children or pets. Wearing a mask is recommended to not breathe in any dust, and goggles to stop it splashing into your eyes.

The 6th Mini Album, ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’ is the final page of the ‘HARMONY’ series, depicting the completion of the harmonious world through water, which is an indispensable element\n\nThe album title ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’ reflects P1Harmony’s spirit of dedicating everything to the harmonious world. The title song ‘JUMP’ is a dance music of alternative pop genre with hip-hop based sound. A free and dynamic performance captures P1Harmony’s message to “JUMP” higher together while enjoying the feelings at the moment rather than worrying and hesitating.\n\nIn addition to the title track, ‘JUMP’, a total of six tracks are included in this album: a hip-hop track with an impressive piano riff, ‘Love Me For Me,’ ‘New Classic’ featuring a hip-hop-like synth sound and 808 bass riff, ‘More Than Words,’ with a dreamy synth sound and colorful vocals, a pop dance song, ‘Heartbeat Drum,’ and ‘I Am You,’ a slow-tempo R&B song.\n \nThe last in the 'HARMONY' series, P1Harmony has completed the perfect world with the 6th Mini Album. This album will be a high quality album that will make you realize that P1Harmony is also an indispensable group like water.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_official\n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_members\n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official\n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TIKTOK : https://www.tiktok.com/@p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #6th_Mini_Album #HARMONY #ALLIN #JUMP","title":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) – ‘JUMP’ MV","duration":193,"channel_id":"UCZECMCJJJE47ei170XCXgdA","author":"FNCEnt","date":"20230608","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hc1OjFxv-M","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Hc1OjFxv-M/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":20700328}}
