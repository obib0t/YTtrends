{"description":"Christine Brown and Janelle Brown are in a new stage of their lives. Christine recently got married and gushed over her wedding telling Access Hollywood it was \"a dream come true.\" \"I never expected like a soulmate or true love really like that, just because I hadn't known what it was like. When I met David, I remember the moment specifically where I fell in love with him,\" she said. Christine also teased what it was like when her new husband, David Woolley, met her ex-husband, Kody Brown. Christine isn't the only one starting fresh, Janelle is no longer with Kody and she told Access when she first thought about leaving her ex. The two ladies also gave their honest opinion on Kody's marriage to Robyn Brown.

{"description":"The 2024 Lexus LC500 Convertible ($129,186 starting in Canada, $106,550 starting in the US) is a comfortable GT cruiser, with a 5.0L V8 engine that bellows out a sonorous note and 471 horsepower as it climbs to its 7100 rpm redline. Best enjoyed with the top down, the LC500 Convertible makes a strong case for why it should be the GT car of choice. And given its price in comparison to some of its competition, the LC looks to provide some serious bang for your buck in the comfy GT category. Thomas and James are always happy to be behind the wheel of an LC500 - let’s see what they have to say! We hope you enjoy the episode.

Enter promo code UNDECIDED to get up to 6 additional months for free at https://surfshark.deals/undecided It might surprise you to learn that the basic chemistry of the lithium ion battery at the heart of a brand new Tesla or iPhone hasn’t changed all that much in the last 30 years. So, when several of you left comments pointing me in the direction of a new company that’s replacing a key part of the battery with silicon and some nanowires, my curiosity was piqued. To add to that, one of my science advisory team members brought them up, too, which only added fuel to the curiosity fire.

{"description":"Tickets on sale NOW! Sea you there.\n#Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - Only in theaters December 22.\n\nDirector James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa—along with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman—return in the sequel to the highest-grossing DC film of all time: “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.”\n\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father’s death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.\n\nAll returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman’s half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother’s reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis’ Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father’s death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.\n\nDirected by Wan, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.\n\nThe screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa’a Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. \n\nJoining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of “Aquaman” artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2”), production designer Bill Brzeski (“Jumanji: The Next Level”), editor Kirk Morri (“Furious 7”), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (“Malignant”). Visual effects supervisor Nick Davis (“The Clash of the Titans” films, “The Dark Knight”) and costume designer Richard Sale (“Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” “Ready Player One”) also join.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents An Atomic Monster / A Peter Safran Production of A James Wan Film, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” set to open in theaters internationally beginning 22 December 2023 and in North America on December 22, 2023; it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom | Tickets on Sale","duration":90,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

Buy houses in the city, decorate them and increase their value. Earn income by advertising these houses for rent or for sale. Don't forget to use your bargaining skills!\n\n\nConstruction Vacant land is opportunity! Buy these plots and build your dream house! Construction workers will help you build the house you want.\n\nCustomers are coming! Negotiate and try to get the best offer. Try to deal with reputable clients. When the rent day comes, you have to go to the houses and collect the rent money from the tenants, but some customers may not pay the rent. However, if you have a bank account, the rent money will be deposited into your account. Don't forget to check regularly. If you have a problem with a tenant, you can contact a lawyer and sue or try to collect the rent money in other ways. You can even beat them up!\n\n\n\n\nNews Centre You need to keep up with what's happening in the city. Neighbourhood factors affect rental prices. If a new school opens in the city, house rents in the neighbourhood may rise. Don't forget to look at newspaper adverts. You can get news about the city by talking to people. Go for a drink. Maybe it will help you to hear what is being said at the next table.\n\n\nAfter a tiring day, watch your favorite movie, relax and raise your relationship level with your partner.\n\n\nCan you drive a van? Go to the dealer in the city, buy the stuff and increase the value of the house you want to rent out. Be careful not to forget to take your lorry with you, the stuff is quite heavy.\n\n\nEntertainment: You deserve to have some fun too! Try to discover the venues in the city. In some places you will have fun and earn money at the same time.","title":"How I Made $3,262,221,056 Ruining the Real Estate Market - Estate Agent Simulator","duration":1757,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20231118","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSk8ltE6Nts","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sSk8ltE6Nts/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1798126}}

{"description":"This is the second fully integrated full stack test flight of Starship and the mighty Super Heavy booster, the largest and most most powerful rocket to ever fly. It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. \n\nThe goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-2 in April 20th which didn't make it to stage separation while also hoping the improvements to the launch pad hold up better than the previous attempt. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter near Hawaii about 90 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, nearly completing an orbit of the Earth. This would allow the teams to test the reentry profile and heat shields for the first time from orbital velocities. \n\nWant more information?

{"description":"How did a manhole cover throw the entire Las Vegas GP into absolute Chaos?\n\nIn this video I will give you a run down of the entire Las Vegas GP manhole drama. After a mere eight minutes of FP1, the session was red-flagged and eventually the Vegas GP practice (FP1) cancelled due to a safety issue. This caused massive delays throughout the night and caused Vegas FP2 delays!\n\nCarlos Sainz was the victom of the Vegas manhole cover, hitting it at high speed and causing significant damage to his Ferrari. The impact was so severe that it cracked his chassis, requiring a replacement. As a result of the incident the FIA decided on a Carlos Sainz grid penalty.\n\nThese Vegas GP delays left F1 fans unhappy with the situation, many of whom had paid top dollar for tickets to the event.
