Secret Invasion has come out after a deluge of other superhero shows and people seem to be… tired of this?\n\nSecret Invasion definitely raises some questions. Like why didn’t the show play more with the mystery of who is a Skrull and who isn’t? Why doesn’t Nick Fury call the Avengers? If this fight is so personal, why doesn’t he actually fight it?

As Tommy leaves New York after losing Ghost, LaKeisha and the only city he's ever known, he makes a quick detour to close an old wound that’s been haunting him for decades. What was supposed to be a quick stop turns into a labyrinth of family secrets and lies Tommy thought were long buried.  One step leads to another and Tommy quickly finds himself in Chicago's drug game, inserting himself between the city's two biggest crews. In a city divided by race, Tommy straddles the line, ultimately becoming the lynchpin that not only unites them - but holds the POWER to watch them crumble. As the first season unfolds at breakneck speed, Tommy uses his outsider status to his advantage, breaking all the local rules and rewriting them on his quest to become the biggest drug dealer in Chicago.v","title":"Power Book IV: Force | Official Trailer | Season 2","duration":119,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230810","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02K63ZxlZo4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/02K63ZxlZo4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2519300}}

{"description":"Bobby Carter | August 8, 2023\nThere are times during Action Bronson's Tiny Desk when his vocals momentarily drift. We instruct our guests to face the directional microphones so that our recorders clearly pick up the voices. Action warned us of the improbability of that happening before we started filming and sure enough, the Flushing, Queens emcee strolled off mic a couple of times, did an about face here and there and even took a knee mid-show. By the time we got to \"Latin Grammys,\" he looked over to our engineer Josh Rogosin and said, \"I told you I couldn't stand still. How do you play music still?\" He's got a point.\n\nAction's band Human Growth Hormone reinterprets his records so funky, it's nearly impossible not to move, yet the small imperfections during the set tickled me. Bam Bam, primarily known as a rapper, has turned his passion for food, clothing, sneakers, wrestling, writing, fitness and painting into bonafide professions. Never veering too far away from the booth, he's consistently dropped projects since 2011. After working out in the green room, Mr. Baklava walked to the Desk, greeting nearly every person in the room with a handshake, and proceeded to perform highlights from Mr. Wonderful, Lamb Over Rice, White Bronco, and Only For Dolphins. Bronson was born to entertain us.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Dmtri\"\n\"Live from the Moon\"\n\"Latin Grammys\"\n\"Terry\"\n\"Baby Blue\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAction Bronson: vocals, effects\nMatt \"Yung Mehico\" Carrillo: keys, saxophone\nNicholas Coleman: bass\nWahkiba \"9Ether\" Julion: drums\nRed Walrus: percussion\nJulian Love: guitar\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #actionbronson","title":"Action Bronson: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1673,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230808","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUN8pdgA0m8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CUN8pdgA0m8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1156881}}

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #BedWars #foltyn","title":"BEDWARS FINALLY LISTENED TO ME!!","duration":573,"channel_id":"UCRkuUgtDAL4XSU5jB40J_wA","author":"Foltyn","date":"20230809","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S79ivpYobSk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/S79ivpYobSk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":280628}}

{"description":"Dig into how airplane mode works, and find out why it’s still important to use the setting when you fly.\n\n--\n\nRight now, invisible signals are flying through the air all around you.

Brotato is a top-down arena shooter roguelite where you play a potato wielding up to 6 weapons at a time to fight off hordes of aliens. Choose from a variety of traits and items to create unique builds and survive until help arrives.\n\nOur build is going to be exploiting trees and the luck statistics to generate more upgrades than the game realistically expects and the luck stat ensures they are likely unique or legendary upgrades. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nBROTATO CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 - Coming up...\n00:07 - Welcome to BROTATO\n01:01 - Waves 1  - 20\n15:44 - Waves 21 - 29\n23:52 - Waves 40 - 49\n26:23 - THE FINAL WAVE: WAVE 50\n27:53 - Thank you and goodbye!\n\nTitle: I Became A God in BROTATO - A perfectly balanced game with no exploits\n\n#game #brotato #god","title":"I Became A GOD in BROTATO - A Perfectly Balanced Game with no exploits","duration":1704,"channel_id":"UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ","author":"The Spiffing Brit","date":"20230807","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaw3jLuIQ28","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iaw3jLuIQ28/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":632176}}

{"description":"Thanks to everyone for joining us for this race: \n- Red Bull: @redbullracing \n- Rimac: https://www.instagram.com/rimac_automobili/\n- McMurtry: https://www.instagram.com/mcmurtryautomotive/\n\nGet ready for the most exciting drag race in carwow history! \n\nWe’ve got the World Championship-winning Red Bull RB8 going up against the 1,914hp Rimac Nevera and the Goodwood Hillclimb record-holding McMurtry Spéirling!\n\nSo let’s see how these marvellous machines compare. Starting with the Rimac, it’s equipped with four electric motors that can produce an eye-watering 1,914hp and 2,360Nm of torque. It’s packing a 120kWh battery pack, so as a result it’s pretty heavy, tipping the scales at around 2,300kg. And as you can imagine, all of that power doesn’t come cheap, with the Nevera costing around £2,000,000! \n\nAlongside it we have the McMurtry. This single-seater EV is a whole lot lighter than the Rimac, weighing in at just 1,000kg. It’s also equipped with two electric motors that produce around 1,000hp, while also packing an incredible fan system that helps to generate 2,000kg of downforce! As a result, it can shoot off from the line like nothing you’ve ever seen before! But there’s a catch - it’s limited to a top speed of only 150mph...\n\nThen finally we have the F1 car, driven by Red Bull’s reserve driver, Liam Lawson. He’s driving Sebastian Vettel’s Championship-winning RB8, which is equipped with a 2.4-litre V8 that can produce 800hp. It’s easily the lightest car here, at around 700kg, and all power is sent to the rear wheels only. \n\nSo it’s an absolutely incredible line-up, but will electric power triumph?! Or will the F1 car prove victorious? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!\n\nMcMurtry Spéirling review & 1/4-mile: https://bit.ly/-McMurtry-Speirling-Review\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"F1 Car vs World's FASTEST Hypercars: DRAG RACE","duration":882,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230805","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCzCqqVGQYE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PCzCqqVGQYE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4333945}}
