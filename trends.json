It‚Äôs powered by an incredible 5-litre twin-turbo V8 that delivers an eye-watering 1,360kg and 1,573Nm of torque. It‚Äôs equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and sends all of its power to the rear wheels. It‚Äôs also super light, tipping the scales at 1,395kg, and it‚Äôs easily the most expensive car Mat has ever drag-raced, with an estimated value of ¬£3,500,000!! \n\nAlongside it, we have the Tesla Model S Plaid. It‚Äôs equipped with three motors, and they combine to put down 1,020hp and 1,420Nm, with all of this power being sent to all four wheels. Naturally, being electric, it‚Äôs weighed down a bit by the batteries and motors, and as a result, it weighs in at 2,190kg. \n\nThen finally we have the Hayabusa. But this is no usual Suzuki Hayabusa! It‚Äôs had a supercharger fitted to it, and as a result, its 1.3-litre 4-cylinder engine produces 385hp and 280Nm of torque! This power is sent to the rear wheels, and of course, it‚Äôs oh-so light, weighing in at 257kg. \n\nSo how will this one play out - will the electric power of the Tesla propel it to victory? Or will either the Koenigsegg or Hayabusa sneak it? There‚Äôs only one way to find out‚Ä¶ LET‚ÄôS RACE!\n\n\nMat‚Äôs quickest 1/4-mile EVER: https://bit.ly/Mats-Quickest-Launch-Ever\n\nFerrari SF90 v Tesla Model S Plaid v Porsche 911 Turbo S: https://bit.ly/Ferrari-SF90-v-Model-S-Plaid-v-911-Turbo\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"Koenigsegg v Tesla Plaid v Turbo Hayabusa: DRAG RACE","duration":1160,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6jMR7-NZMM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/J6jMR7-NZMM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1908776}}

{"description":"Spain and Italy clashed in the UEFA Nations League Semifinals. Both teams came in hot with early goals in the first minutes of the half. Spain's Yeremy Pino smashed in a beautiful goal in the second minute to show their fury. Italy retaliated when Ciro Immobile scored an equalizer in the 11th minute. After the intense fist half, defenses tightened up until Spain found their opening in the 88th minute when Mato Joselu launched a rocket in the back of the net. Spain will now advance and face Croatia in the final.\n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #Spain\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n‚ñ∫PBC ON FOX‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n‚ñ∫WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n‚ñ∫NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n‚ñ∫CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer‚Äôs YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

{"description":"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nAshley Pointer | June 14, 2023\nIt's practically a sin to not have Durrell \"Tank\" Babbs on your spiciest playlist ‚Äî he's penned some of the steamiest records in R&B. If you've been following our Black Music Month takeover, it's likely you spotted Tank accompanying Babyface, the love maestro himself, on background vocals. In his own concert, the veteran crooner and R&B scholar performed a 14-song medley of passionate love songs and bedroom bops from across his 23 years-long career in music, and turned the Tiny Desk into \"the big, nasty Desk.\"\n\nThis doesn't happen without warning: \"Some of these songs make you wanna make up. Some of these songs make you wanna breakup and some of these songs make you want to participate in various sexual activities,\" Tank declared before traversing his catalog. Backed by the phenomenal Florida-based MVP Band, along with a trio of famed background vocalists ‚Äî singer-songwriter-actor Luke James, singer Brooke Valentine and songwriter/producer Lonny Bereal ‚Äî we got a taste of the songs that not only established Tank as a pillar in R&B, but hits he wrote and produced for other notable artists such as Jamie Foxx, Omarion, Marques Houston and LeToya Luckett.\n\nFull of buttery smooth runs and yearning melodies (along with the occasional, witty HR joke), Tank's Tiny Desk concert is a stellar display of how powerful the allure of R&B can be, and perhaps a masterclass for any youngin' learning how to woo.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Slowly\"\n\"Coldest\"\n\"Do What It Do\"\n\"O\"\n\"Naked\"\n\"Regret\"\n\"When We\"\n\"Dirty\"\n\"Can't Let It Show\"\n\"Slow\"\n\"See Through Love\"\n\"Maybe I Deserve\"\n\"I Deserve\"\n\"Please Don't Go\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTank: vocals\nLonny Bereal: vocals\nBrooke Valentine: vocals\nLuke James: vocals\nLa'Chaz Holloway: guitar\nAlex Hill: keys\nJevon Hill: keys, vocals\nArthur Jones: bass\nJimmy Hill: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nEditor: Maia Stern\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel, Kara Frame\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Josh Rogosin, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #tank","title":"Tank: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1097,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230614","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmBxJ2VcUk0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmBxJ2VcUk0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":859130}}

{"description":"And it could swing the 2024 elections.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn 2013, a divided Supreme Court gutted one of the major pillars of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In the 10 years since then, the court has moved even farther to the right. So when the Voting Rights Act came before the Supreme Court again in 2022, it didn‚Äôt look good for the law. But then something completely unexpected happened: in a 5-4 decision, two of the conservative justices voted with the 3 liberal justices to preserve the Voting Rights Act. And the effects could be huge.\n\nAt stake in the case was the way that Alabama divides up its Congressional districts. Alabama has seven districts, one of which is what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúmajority-minority district‚Äù in which Black Americans are the majority of the population. In 2022, a group of Black voters sued the state, saying that under the law, Alabama should actually have two majority-minority districts. And the Supreme Court agreed.\n\nThe reason this matters to the rest of the country is that Alabama‚Äôs not alone ‚Äî several other states in the south are now vulnerable to similar challenges that would increase the number of majority-minority districts. And especially in a region of the country where voting is racially polarized ‚Äî where white people overwhelmingly vote Republican and Black people vote Democrat ‚Äî this decision has the potential to flip multiple Congressional seats in the next election. And in a US House of Representatives where Republicans only hold control by a margin of 10 votes or so, that‚Äôs a big deal.\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nIn 2021 every state in the US with more than one Congressional district redrew them. CNN has a great tool that looks at each state‚Äôs Congressional district map before and after that redistricting, and tracks how many majority-minority districts each state has: https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/georgia-redistricting-map/\n\nFiveThirtyEight has a similar tool: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps\n\nMany of those new district maps are under legal challenge. The Brennan Center for Justice has a really thorough roundup of every legal case underway against those maps: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/redistricting-litigation-roundup-0\n\nThe Brennan Center also has a great summary of the Alabama case: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/merrill-v-milligan-gerrymandering-supreme-court\n\nA big part of the Alabama case was determining whether drawing a second majority-black district would be easy. The mathematician Moon Duchin wrote a brief report for the court that demonstrates that really succinctly: https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Duchin_Report.pdf\n\nThe Guardian built a cool interactive that shows the gerrymandering in Alabama really well: https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/08/alabama-discrimination-black-voters-map-supreme-court\n\nNaturally I recommend reading Vox.com‚Äôs Ian Millhiser breaking down the Alabama decision: https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/8/23753932/supreme-court-john-roberts-milligan-allen-voting-rights-act-alabama-racial-gerrymandering\n\nAnd Vox‚Äôs Christian Paz on the political implications of the case: https://www.vox.com/voting-rights/23754443/supreme-court-alabama-voting-rights-act-congress-democrats-house-louisiana-south-carolina\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"In this episode, Oakley Dokily, the adorable little mini #dachshund who is brother to Crusoe but who lives at home by himself with his parents, is feeling a bit bored and lonely lately, especially when Crusoe and Daphne aren't there to keep him company. \n\nSo, Oakley gets the idea to be like Crusoe and get a new #puppy sister to keep him company, just like Crusoe did with Daphne. So he makes his pitch to mother and father on why they should get a new puppy. Mother and father are surprisingly receptive, and before long, a long haired, mini red dachshund named Delilah has arrived at their home!\n\nOakley is thrilled at first, as he now has a #cute little dachshund puppy to keep him company; to wrestle with... to chase.. to cuddle with. All was perfect. But then the honeymoon phase of owning a puppy wore off, as Oakley lost sleep at night, and started to become annoyed with Delilah always bugging him.\n\nWill Oakley regret his decision to get a new puppy?
