{"description":"And why the US and China are fighting over silicon in the first place.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn October 2022, the Biden administration placed a large-scale ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to China. They also implemented a series of other rules that prevents China from making these chips on their own. These chips are used in everyday technology, like our mobile phones and computers. They’re also crucial to military and intelligence systems, which is one of the main reasons they're at the center of a feud between the United States and China. \n\nMicrochips were first invented in the US in the 1950s, after which their use rapidly expanded worldwide. Since then, the supply chain for these chips has grown and spread to include countries in Europe and Asia. And while some countries have caught up to the US's edge in making these advanced chips, China still falls far behind despite multiple attempts to gain an advantage.\n\nWatch the latest episode of Vox Atlas to understand why China is losing a new cold war with the US over microchips.\n\nSources and further reading: \n\nWe found this book written by Chris Miller very helpful for understanding the history of chip development in the US and the foreign policy behind its competition and feud with China: \n\nChip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002 \n\nThis book gave us great context on China’s efforts to acquire foreign technology: \n\nChinese Industrial Espionage by Anna Puglisi\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Books-Anna-B-Puglisi/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AAnna+B.+Puglisi\n\nArticles like this by Chien-Huei Wu helped us learn more about how much the US replies on east asian countries for successful technology:\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2022/05/east-asian-firms-are-critical-to-americas-semiconductor-success/\n\nReporting by Bloomberg helped us understand major IP theft cases related to semiconductor chips: \nhttps://cset.georgetown.edu/article/engineer-who-fled-charges-of-stealing-chip-technology-in-us-now-thrives-in-china/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They made me feel at home and like I belonged, in a place where I had felt like an outsider.\n\n10 years ago I went out with my best mate Ollie to talk to people on the streets of London about Korea. And since then we’ve had the privilege to introduce Korean culture and food to my friends, family and the world.\n\nThis was truly a surreal experience, and was an honour that we never would have received without all of you, so from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.\n\n--\n\n지난 주, 저희는 버킹엄 궁전에 초대를 받아 영국의 국왕을 만나뵐 수 있는 특별한 경험을 하게 됐어요. 그곳에서 또한 한국에 대해 대화할 수 있는 시간을 가졌다는 게 저에게 정말 의미가 컸어요.\n\n지금으로부터 20년보다 더 전, 중학생 시절 한국 친구들이 저에게 따뜻한 우정으로 손을 내밀어 줬어요. 그 친구들 덕분에 외톨이라고 생각했던 곳에서 어딘가에 속해있다는 유대감을 느낄 수 있었죠.\n\n그리고 10년 전 처음 제 절친 올리와 런던의 길거리로 나가 사람들에게 한국에 대해 소개했어요. 그때부터 저희는 저희의 친구, 가족 그리고 세상에 한국 문화를 소개할수 있는 영광스러운 기회를 가질 수 있었어요.\n\n저희에게 정말 잊지 못할 경험이었고, 여러분 없이는 가능하지 못했을 거라 생각해요. 여러분 정말 고마워요.","title":"We asked King Charles III about Korea!","duration":434,"channel_id":"UCg-p3lQIqmhh7gHpyaOmOiQ","author":"영국남자 Korean Englishman","date":"20230208","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prl6o4D663c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/prl6o4D663c/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1151302}}

{"description":"Hogwarts Legacy reviewed by Travis Northup on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.\nIn nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I’ve always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It’s certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn’t come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me.\n\n#HogwartsLegacy #HogwartsLegacyReview","title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review","duration":630,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230206","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6dZxoob8CY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6dZxoob8CY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2085542}}

One of the many things that makes living off the grid so difficult, beyond the distance, isolation and logistics of surviving in -20 degree weather, is the psychological games your mind can play when you hear sounds in the woods. And as it turns out near the end of this episode, we weren't just imagining things! We were scared half to death, and we have @talandmads to confirm it. This will make much more sense after you watch this episode! And speaking of, we either did something very right, or very wrong with the drywall. We are bracing for the comments on this one, because things looked smooth and level when we went to sleep, but a little off the next day. Did our drywall catfish us?! We love all the helpful comments from our Patreon Pack, and we read all of them, thank you! After a long week of hard work and a few setbacks, nothing like seeing some friendly faces will lift your spirits. It's good to be reminded: if you fail, try again!

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

{"description":"An outdated safety law may have cost hundreds of lives.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nEver since the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, a major suspected culprit for the high death toll has been that there weren’t enough lifeboats on board. It’s a decision that's been dramatized as hubris on the part of the White Star Line — but the ship actually surpassed safety standards for the time. \n\nThe Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 required the largest-class ships, those weighing over 10,000 tons, to carry at least 16 lifeboats. Even though the Titanic, which launched in 1911, weighed 45,000 tons, that minimum was the same. The Titanic carried 20 lifeboats, with a capacity for roughly half of the people on board the night the ship sank. \n\nUntil the Titanic disaster, lifeboats weren’t seen as a substitute for an entire ship. The giant liner itself, which featured 16 compartments separated by watertight bulkheads, was supposed to stay afloat even after taking on water. Then, using a brand new piece of technology — the Marconi wireless telegraph — signal for help from a nearby ship, using lifeboats to methodically ferry passengers off the sinking ship.\n\nThis scenario played out perfectly just a couple years before the Titanic disaster, when a ship accidentally rammed RMS Republic in 1909. The Republic sank, but nearly everyone on board was safely ferried off. The prevailing thought at the time was that disasters at sea had become a thing of the past. \n\nWhen the Titanic went down, that all changed. Just two years later, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) mandated all passenger ships carry lifeboats for everyone on board. Today, the SOLAS requirement is 125% of a ship’s capacity. \n\n\nFurther reading: \nCheck out Sam Halpern’s work analyzing the permissible flooding conditions on the Titanic: \nhttp://www.titanicology.com/FloodingByCompartment.html\n\nRead the 1909 news articles explaining the sinking of the Republic: \nhttps://www.rmsrepublic.news/\n\nDive into a wealth of Titanic research in “On a Sea of Glass” by J.

The lady's brother-in-law, Diamond Platnumz, is having a broken-hearted telepathic conversation with his late brother about the new woman Zuwena has become, and all the hardships she has put them through, including spending all the money, not being there for her mother-in-law, becoming a hussy, and living an extravagant lifestyle.For your listening pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, we present Zuwena, exemplifying the kind of song delivery and performance that has kept Diamond as Platnumz for over a decade.\n\nVideo Shot by Directo Ivan\n\nDiamond Platnumz Booking Info:\nEmail:bookplatnumz@gmail.com | sallam.sharaff@gmail.com\n\nCatch Up With Diamond Platnumz On:\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/diamondplatnumz/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/DiamondPlatnumz255/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/diamondplatnumz/\n\n#Diamondplatnumz #wasafi #music","title":"Diamond Platnumz - Zuwena (Official Music Video)","duration":241,"channel_id":"UCev-b-xy-p5fHK8x3zJyn1Q","author":"Diamond Platnumz","date":"20230203","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOAjuAI0nJA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aOAjuAI0nJA/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":5140317}}

Despite negative reviews from pretty much everyone, the show seems to be the talk of the Internet. Or maybe that’s because of them…\n\nVelma definitely raises some questions. Like where’s Scooby Doo in the Scooby Doo show? Why is every single character just a completely different person than the character they’re based on? Why is everyone so mean?

{"description":"Things got heated in the Cleveland Cavs-Memphis Grizzlies game last night. Dillon Brooks missed a shot driving to the hoop and one of his arms hit Donovan Mitchell while Brooks was on the ground. Mitchell responded by throwing the ball at Brooks and a full scuffle ensued. Both players were ejected and Mitchell did not hold back after the game, saying quote: 'that's just who he is. We've seen it a bunch. Him and I have had our personal battles for years. Quite frankly, I've been busting his *** for years. There's no place for that in the game and you got to protect yourself at the end of the day.'

{"description":"Hey guys! today I am going to be unboxing a bunch of used, damaged squishies that have been sent to me from you guys! I plan on using some of these for my squishy makeover series, where I fix and redecorate  old squishies and create custom art creations. Let me know which squishies you think I should use in the next episode in the comments!\n\n\nFOR ANY NEW PEOPLE:\nToday I am going to be opening a bunch of boxes/packages from my subscribers. Basically \"fanmail\" or P.O. box unboxing, BUT most of these packages are used, dirty, old squishies sent to me from people who no longer want them. I like to fix them up, paint over them, customize them and decorate them to create new works of ART for my video series called \"Squishy Makeovers\". Soooooo every once in a while I like to do these videos, looking through all the candidates I've been sent. It's always very interesting seeing which squishies I get and how bad of condition they are. Plus there are some cute extra gifts thrown in from my very generous viewers that are fun to look through. My current P.O. box address is kept private because I have been overloaded with mail in the past, so I only give it out by request to a handful of people each week (email address to request it, bottom of description). The address you see on a lot of the old packages in this video is NOT my current address, I no longer have access to it.

Cast iron is iron that has a very high carbon content. Its good properties are that it's very hard and has a low melting point. The drawback is that it's relatively brittle compared to regular iron. So I set about trying to find a method for reducing its carbon content.\n\n In this video I smelted local ore (iron bacteria) and obtained cast iron prills. I then tried melting it in a small crucible to obtain a solid ingot to begin the experiment. This gave a poor result though with an incomplete melt. \n\nNext I tried rusting the prills first with the intent of creating iron oxide (rust ) in the iron so that the next melt would combine the materials in an exothermic reaction that would burn the carbon out. In the past, rusty iron was added to cast iron to decarburize it (wet puddling/pig boiling). But this also gave poor results.\n\n Finally, I did away with the mold and simply melted the iron prills by dropping them into the forge in front of the hot air blast of the forge. The reasoning was that the high oxygen would burn out the carbon from the metal. This caused them to melt together to form an ingot. After a few attempts I took one of the ingots and hammered it while still white to yellow hot and hammered it with a stone. The ingot was able to be flattened as it had become malleable. This was the result I wanted.\n\nThis method of decarburization (melting cast iron in a open hearth to make it malleable) was used throughout history at different times. In ancient China it was known as \"stir fried steel/ 炒钢\" and in the west known as the \"Osmond process\". I also read that in India, cast iron ingots from the crucible were brought to a temperature just below melting point before becoming forgeable. \nIn future experiments I hope to use this technique to decarburize iron ingots to make into forged metal tools as opposed to the cast knife I made in a previous video. \n\nChapters: \n00:00 Overview of my standard smelting process\n00:50 Crucible ingot (failure)\n02:21 Decarburization via rusting (failure)\n04:22 Decarburization without crucible (inconclusive)\n05:45 Decarburization without crucible/forging  (success)\n07:01 Decarburized and forged iron result\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
