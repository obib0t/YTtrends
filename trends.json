{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by 'Pretty Little Liars' star Ashley Benson to tour her playful home in Los Angeles. Designed in 1930 by architect Arthur Kelly, Ashley's home is an Old Hollywood gem–and having had only three owners in over 90s years it's practically untouched. Inspired by her love of Europe and Nancy Meyer’s movies, Ashley enlisted interior designer Nicole Gordon, and architect John Farrace to help bring her home into the 21st century. From astronaut wallpaper to the ultimate coastal grandmother kitchen, Benson has created a playful space with something fun hidden around each corner.“I wanted to make each turn and each room—no matter the size—a unique experience.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Ashley's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-ashley-bensons-personal-and-playful-los-angeles-home \r\n\r\nSAG-AFTRA members are currently on strike; as part of the strike, union actors are not promoting their film and TV projects.

{"description":"Join us as we document the impacts of Tropical Storm Hilary, which brought historic flooding to Southern California in August 2023. Starting in Long Beach, we see communities band together to fill sandbags and build barricades along the coast to hold back the storm surge. But as Hilary moves inland, flash flooding hits the desert border towns and washes mud and debris onto Interstate 10 near Palm Springs.\n\nRide along as we drive through neighborhoods turned into rivers, wake up stranded drivers on the flooded interstate, and survey the damage left behind. From preparations along the coast to cars stuck in desert flood waters, this intense storm gives Southern California a taste of tropical weather rarely seen in the region.\n\nWith interviews from locals, see how SoCal responds to this record-breaking flood event. \n\nHilary was only the fourth tropical storm or hurricane on record to stay intact upon reaching California (1997 Nora, 1939 Long Beach tropical storm, and the 1858 San Diego hurricane) and the most significant in over 80 years!!!\n\nIf you enjoyed the drone video, please subscribe to @WxChasing","title":"Tropical Storm Hilary | Documenting the Deluge Soaking SoCal","duration":1138,"channel_id":"UCXoMM35ugF5iOzAEb-PmfRA","author":"Jonathan Petramala","date":"20230821","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9UjNOiECkc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_9UjNOiECkc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":353478}}

{"description":"We Tried The Minecraft COOKBOOK In Real Life... Yes, Minecraft has a cookbook, and it's crazy. From chicken jockeys to SUSPICIOUS STEW...? We tried it all and rated it on a scale of 1-10 hunger bars.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @sapnap\n➽ Twitch - @sapnap\n➽ Instagram - @sapnapinsta\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nDream: @dream \nMythical Kitchen: @mythicalkitchen \n\nI heard Minecraft made an official cookbook, and I had already tried all the Minecraft food myself, so I thought I HAD to try the OFFICIAL cookbook and see what it's like. I brought my friends GeorgeNotFound and Dream to try with me. This was our first real life Minecraft challenge as the Dream Team! The recipes were more complicated than my first time trying Minecraft food in my video \"I Ate EVERY Minecraft Food In Real Life...\", so we couldn't just use Dream's mom to cook it all. We had to hire professional chefs.\n\nI don't know any professional chefs, so I thought of reaching out to some of the best chefs on Youtube at the Mythical Kitchen! They make all the food behind the scenes for Rhett & Link at Good Mythical Morning, so I thought they would have plenty of experience making food to be judged by us. We tried food from Minecraft cake to Minecraft suspicious stew and rated them on a scale of one hunger bar to ten, based on the OFFICIAL Minecraft Cookbook recipe. Unfortunately no spider eyes or raw meat, because this is straight from Mojang, and they made sure all the recipes were safe.\n\nIf this video gets a ridiculous amount of likes (500,000 ? that seems impossible), we will try and have professional chef's recreate every Minecraft food from in game, as accurate to survival Minecraft 1.20 as possible. So basically a combination of this video, and my old video, and with George and Dream being forced to eat the nasty food with me...\n\nthank you guys for watching and hope you guys enjoy :) shoutout to team mythical and Trevor and Josh","title":"We Tried The Minecraft COOKBOOK In Real Life...","duration":1078,"channel_id":"UCqynl7rdtktKMQESdSBmE-g","author":"Sapnap","date":"20230820","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GIXtim-GKU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7GIXtim-GKU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":433974}}

{"description":"Stephen Thompson | August 15, 2023\nThe Tiny Desk has hosted plenty of major pop, rock and hip-hop stars in its 15-plus years, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one more agreeable or self-effacing than Austin Richard Post. Whether lamenting the state of his singing voice, joking about his nerves or sitting slack-jawed in awe of the fantastic band his people had assembled for this show, Post had the bearing of a lottery winner who wouldn't even give himself credit for buying a ticket.\n\nBefore, during and after the show, Post Malone was a joy to have around. But he also just happened to bring a few of the biggest pop hits of the 21st century: Set-opener \"Sunflower,\" for example, has been certified eighteen-times platinum by the RIAA since its release in 2018 — that's an all-time record — while the 2017 single \"I Fall Apart\" and 2019's \"Circles\" lag behind at a mere ten-times platinum apiece. \"Enough Is Enough,\" which closes this set, enjoys no such designation, but give it time: A track from Post Malone's new album Austin, it's only been out for a few weeks.\n\nSo enjoy this set for what it is: one of the world's biggest stars, performing a few of the world's biggest songs, each set to a luminous arrangement. Post Malone himself seems surprised by how great this Tiny Desk concert sounds, and that's not just the humility talking.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Sunflower\"\n\"I Fall Apart\"\n\"Circles\"\n\"Enough Is Enough\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAustin Post: lead vocalist, guitar \nHannah Juliano: vocalist\nElliot Aguilar: vocalist\nChauncey Matthews: vocalist\nKola Rail: vocalist\nDestin Johnson: drums\nEmily Rosenfield: guitar \nBobby Wooten: bass \nLouis Bell: piano\nKevin Kuh: strings \nFrancesca Dardani: strings \nKiku Enomoto: strings\nKirin McElwain: strings\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Suraya Mohamed\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Zayrha Rodriguez, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Team: Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #postmalone","title":"Post Malone: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1088,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230815","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCcks-fwq2c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCcks-fwq2c/hqdefault.jpg?v=64da7e22","content":{"View count":5533597}}

{"description":"Pre-order NHL 24 X-Factor Edition: http://x.ea.com/77254\n\nEA SPORTS™ NHL® 24 officially launches worldwide October 6th featuring Cale Makar as your cover athlete. \n\nIn NHL 24, all-new gameplay features bring authentic on-ice action to life. Experience the rush and fatigue of a high-pressure game with the Exhaust Engine, where sustained pressure in the attack zone leads to new game-changing effects like goalie fatigue that slows the netminder’s reaction time the more they get worn down with offensive action; change the momentum with Physics-Based Contact as you break the glass and send players into the bench with big body checks; and get unparalleled player command with the new Vision Passing System and Total Control Skill Moves.\n\nChel is more connected than ever with cross-play in all online team play modes, along with HUT Moments, which lets you recreate classic moments in hockey history and today’s biggest plays. Adding an extra layer of authenticity, Flex Moments introduces 75+ new goal celebrations, and a wholly refreshed presentation complements an enriched crowd atmosphere that makes playing the game feel like you’re at the game.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more NHL 24 Trailers: https://bit.ly/3kF5rTK\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsnhl\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsnhl \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/easportsnhl\n\n\n#NHL24 #Reveal","title":"NHL 24 Reveal Trailer | Official Gameplay","duration":321,"channel_id":"UCLydKeNR8rf-yoUu9J2acMg","author":"EA SPORTS NHL","date":"20230816","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSbtHgyMrX4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/TSbtHgyMrX4/hqdefault.webp?v=64dce76c","content":{"View count":340056}}
