But, it turns out, there is such a spot. The COLD BLOB off of Greenland mystified scientists for years, but new studies have uncovered a scary reality - this cool patch might be a warning of the impending collapse of a vital earth circulation system. And the consequences would be dire. \n\nIn this episode of Weathered, we travel to the Gulf Stream with the new PBS Terra show Sharks Unknown to experience the AMOC first hand. And we ask, what is the likelihood that the AMOC will collapse, and what would the consequences be?\n\nWeathered is a show hosted by weather expert Maiya May and produced by Balance Media that helps explain the most common natural disasters, what causes them, how they’re changing, and what we can do to prepare.\n\nThis episode of Weathered is licensed exclusively to YouTube.\n\nSubscribe to PBS Terra so you never miss an episode! https://bit.ly/3mOfd77\n\nAnd keep up with Weathered and PBS Terra on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PBSDigitalSt...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pbsds\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pbsds\n\nSources:\nDitlevsen & Ditlevsen. “Warming of a forthcoming collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation”.

{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by 'Pretty Little Liars' star Ashley Benson to tour her playful home in Los Angeles. Designed in 1930 by architect Arthur Kelly, Ashley's home is an Old Hollywood gem–and having had only three owners in over 90s years it's practically untouched. Inspired by her love of Europe and Nancy Meyer’s movies, Ashley enlisted interior designer Nicole Gordon, and architect John Farrace to help bring her home into the 21st century. From astronaut wallpaper to the ultimate coastal grandmother kitchen, Benson has created a playful space with something fun hidden around each corner.“I wanted to make each turn and each room—no matter the size—a unique experience.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Ashley's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-ashley-bensons-personal-and-playful-los-angeles-home \r\n\r\nSAG-AFTRA members are currently on strike; as part of the strike, union actors are not promoting their film and TV projects.

{"description":"We Tried The Minecraft COOKBOOK In Real Life... Yes, Minecraft has a cookbook, and it's crazy. From chicken jockeys to SUSPICIOUS STEW...? We tried it all and rated it on a scale of 1-10 hunger bars.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @sapnap\n➽ Twitch - @sapnap\n➽ Instagram - @sapnapinsta\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nDream: @dream \nMythical Kitchen: @mythicalkitchen \n\nI heard Minecraft made an official cookbook, and I had already tried all the Minecraft food myself, so I thought I HAD to try the OFFICIAL cookbook and see what it's like. I brought my friends GeorgeNotFound and Dream to try with me. This was our first real life Minecraft challenge as the Dream Team! The recipes were more complicated than my first time trying Minecraft food in my video \"I Ate EVERY Minecraft Food In Real Life...\", so we couldn't just use Dream's mom to cook it all. We had to hire professional chefs.\n\nI don't know any professional chefs, so I thought of reaching out to some of the best chefs on Youtube at the Mythical Kitchen! They make all the food behind the scenes for Rhett & Link at Good Mythical Morning, so I thought they would have plenty of experience making food to be judged by us. We tried food from Minecraft cake to Minecraft suspicious stew and rated them on a scale of one hunger bar to ten, based on the OFFICIAL Minecraft Cookbook recipe. Unfortunately no spider eyes or raw meat, because this is straight from Mojang, and they made sure all the recipes were safe.\n\nIf this video gets a ridiculous amount of likes (500,000 ? that seems impossible), we will try and have professional chef's recreate every Minecraft food from in game, as accurate to survival Minecraft 1.20 as possible. So basically a combination of this video, and my old video, and with George and Dream being forced to eat the nasty food with me...\n\nthank you guys for watching and hope you guys enjoy :) shoutout to team mythical and Trevor and Josh","title":"We Tried The Minecraft COOKBOOK In Real Life...","duration":1078,"channel_id":"UCqynl7rdtktKMQESdSBmE-g","author":"Sapnap","date":"20230820","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GIXtim-GKU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7GIXtim-GKU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":458070}}

{"description":"Stephen Thompson | August 15, 2023\nThe Tiny Desk has hosted plenty of major pop, rock and hip-hop stars in its 15-plus years, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one more agreeable or self-effacing than Austin Richard Post. Whether lamenting the state of his singing voice, joking about his nerves or sitting slack-jawed in awe of the fantastic band his people had assembled for this show, Post had the bearing of a lottery winner who wouldn't even give himself credit for buying a ticket.\n\nBefore, during and after the show, Post Malone was a joy to have around. But he also just happened to bring a few of the biggest pop hits of the 21st century: Set-opener \"Sunflower,\" for example, has been certified eighteen-times platinum by the RIAA since its release in 2018 — that's an all-time record — while the 2017 single \"I Fall Apart\" and 2019's \"Circles\" lag behind at a mere ten-times platinum apiece. \"Enough Is Enough,\" which closes this set, enjoys no such designation, but give it time: A track from Post Malone's new album Austin, it's only been out for a few weeks.\n\nSo enjoy this set for what it is: one of the world's biggest stars, performing a few of the world's biggest songs, each set to a luminous arrangement. Post Malone himself seems surprised by how great this Tiny Desk concert sounds, and that's not just the humility talking.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Sunflower\"\n\"I Fall Apart\"\n\"Circles\"\n\"Enough Is Enough\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAustin Post: lead vocalist, guitar \nHannah Juliano: vocalist\nElliot Aguilar: vocalist\nChauncey Matthews: vocalist\nKola Rail: vocalist\nDestin Johnson: drums\nEmily Rosenfield: guitar \nBobby Wooten: bass \nLouis Bell: piano\nKevin Kuh: strings \nFrancesca Dardani: strings \nKiku Enomoto: strings\nKirin McElwain: strings\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Suraya Mohamed\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Zayrha Rodriguez, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Team: Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #postmalone","title":"Post Malone: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1088,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230815","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCcks-fwq2c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCcks-fwq2c/hqdefault.jpg?v=64da7e22","content":{"View count":5614796}}

He fell into psychosis and began spending all his time alone in his bedroom planning mass murder.

{"description":"Pre-order NHL 24 X-Factor Edition: http://x.ea.com/77254\n\nEA SPORTS™ NHL® 24 officially launches worldwide October 6th featuring Cale Makar as your cover athlete. \n\nIn NHL 24, all-new gameplay features bring authentic on-ice action to life. Experience the rush and fatigue of a high-pressure game with the Exhaust Engine, where sustained pressure in the attack zone leads to new game-changing effects like goalie fatigue that slows the netminder’s reaction time the more they get worn down with offensive action; change the momentum with Physics-Based Contact as you break the glass and send players into the bench with big body checks; and get unparalleled player command with the new Vision Passing System and Total Control Skill Moves.\n\nChel is more connected than ever with cross-play in all online team play modes, along with HUT Moments, which lets you recreate classic moments in hockey history and today’s biggest plays. Adding an extra layer of authenticity, Flex Moments introduces 75+ new goal celebrations, and a wholly refreshed presentation complements an enriched crowd atmosphere that makes playing the game feel like you’re at the game.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more NHL 24 Trailers: https://bit.ly/3kF5rTK\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsnhl\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsnhl \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/easportsnhl\n\n\n#NHL24 #Reveal","title":"NHL 24 Reveal Trailer | Official Gameplay","duration":321,"channel_id":"UCLydKeNR8rf-yoUu9J2acMg","author":"EA SPORTS NHL","date":"20230816","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSbtHgyMrX4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/TSbtHgyMrX4/hqdefault.webp?v=64dce76c","content":{"View count":342385}}
