{"description":"Don’t miss the full trailer this Thursday. #Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - Only in theaters December 20.\n\nDirector James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa—along with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman—return in the sequel to the highest-grossing DC film of all time: “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.”\n\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father’s death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.\n\nAll returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman’s half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother’s reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis’ Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father’s death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.\n\nDirected by Wan, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.\n\nThe screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa’a Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. \n\nJoining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of “Aquaman” artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2”), production designer Bill Brzeski (“Jumanji: The Next Level”), editor Kirk Morri (“Furious 7”), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (“Malignant”). Visual effects supervisor Nick Davis (“The Clash of the Titans” films, “The Dark Knight”) and costume designer Richard Sale (“Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” “Ready Player One”) also join.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents An Atomic Monster / A Peter Safran Production of A James Wan Film, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” set to open in theaters internationally beginning 20 December 2023 and in North America on December 20, 2023; it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom | Teaser","duration":30,"channel_id":"UCiifkYAs_bq1pt_zbNAzYGg","author":"DC","date":"20230911","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbb4e_Q6wR8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fbb4e_Q6wR8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1266555}}

{"description":"FOX Sports’ lead college football analyst Joel Klatt marvels at the atmosphere in Boulder as Coach Prime won his home debut over Nebraska. Klatt breaks down what impressed him about their win while also considering how incredible it is that a Colorado team that was 1-11 last season is captivating the country right now. Next, he shifts to Texas’ huge win over Alabama and why it shows that the Longhorns are legitimate national championship contenders this year. He also reveals how far the win in Tuscaloosa launched Texas up his Top 10 rankings. Klatt states whether that game was a sign that Alabama under Saban is set for a fall from the sport’s elite programs.  He then discusses how scary USC is this year and why he believes this team is different than last year’s group.  He also goes in on how Texas A&M continues to fall short in the Jimbo Fisher era after their loss in Miami.  Finally, Klatt reacts to the news of Michigan State HC Mel Tucker being suspended without pay due to an investigation into sexual harassment allegations.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Joel Klatt Show content: \nhttps://rb.gy/7sbi9\n\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►The Joel Klatt Show YouTube Channel: https://bit.ly/joelklattshow_yt\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n \nSee more from The Joel Klatt Show: https://www.foxsports.com/shows/the-joel-klatt-show\n\nLike The Joel Klatt Show on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JoelKlattShow/\nFollow The Joel Klatt Show on Twitter: https://twitter.com/JoelKlattShow\nFollow The Joel Klatt Show on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joelklattshow/\n\nColorado & Coach Prime take down Nebraska, Texas rolls the Tide & rises in Klatt’s Top 10 Rankings\nhttps://youtu.be/FkVM19h9Kus","title":"Colorado & Coach Prime take down Nebraska, Texas rolls the Tide & rises in Klatt’s Top 10 Rankings","duration":2870,"channel_id":"UCJn33SOv86632dLg_qVVlcg","author":"The Joel Klatt Show: A College Football Podcast","date":"20230911","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkVM19h9Kus","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkVM19h9Kus/hqdefault.jpg?v=64feb3d4","content":{"View count":179921}}

Buckle up & get your fingernails ready, cause this one is a wild ride! a few years ago, I had the crazy idea to make a custom food truck of some sort - I just needed the perfect opportunity to do it. So when Cristine and I decided to create a Holo Taco collection together, I thought why not now - let's make a (holo) taco truck!! \n\nSo we took a super old FedEx truck and renovated it into a batty, vampy, ~holographic~ nail polish truck! Once it was finished, we loaded an army of nail polish into the truck and drove it around to several different meet ups around Raleigh. At each location, we gave away some free nail polish, saw lots of great nail art (a decent amount of which is featured in this video), & gave out some other fiendish goodies for you guys to enjoy (think chocolate & boba)!! \n\nThank you to everyone who could make the event!! What do you guys think of our nail polish truck? What should we turn the truck into next??\n\nAnd now, we’ve finally reached the release date of the safiya x Holo Taco collection!! I hope you guys love it as much as we do! You can shop the limited edition collection now here: https://holota.co/safiyaxholotaco \n\nHuge thank you to the people over at Jack of All Trades by George for the crazy transformation of our nail polish truck - you can find them here!! https://www.jackofalltradesbygeorge.com/\n\nAnd thank you to our partners for the event day - Lola’s Nail Closet, Escazú, & MILKLAB!!

There was a window to help my dad; if we didn't, he would remain paralyzed for the rest of his life. Because we live in America, every step to get him this vital physical therapy has put my parents in a financially terrifying position. From having to purchase a $50,000 wheelchair-accessible vehicle due to the insurance that they paid $1400 a month for (for many, many years) failing them, and the lack of any form of public transportation or services to help him get to the physical therapy they are now paying out of pocket for, and due to this accident leaving both my parents out of a job... They need your help. Thank you for your time, and we do appreciate anyone who donates.\n\n(We live in times where we as citizens are underpaid, underappreciated, and forced to pay the incredibly high artificially inflated prices greedy \"businessmen\" have made for us, so please hear me when I say, only donate if you feel you can.)","title":"Gofund my Dad","duration":394,"channel_id":"UCvUmwreRrbxeR1mbmojj8fg","author":"SomeThingElseYT","date":"20230909","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvG3U0XRydI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvG3U0XRydI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":850975}}

{"description":"When monsters emerge, secrets follow. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters premieres November 17 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/_Monarch\n\nFollowing the thunderous battle between Godzilla and the Titans that leveled San Francisco, and the shocking revelation that monsters are real, “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” tracks two siblings following in their father’s footsteps to uncover their family’s connection to the secretive organization known as Monarch. \n\nClues lead them into the world of monsters and ultimately down the rabbit hole to Army Officer Lee Shaw (played by Kurt Russell and Wyatt Russell), taking place in the 1950s and half a century later where Monarch is threatened by what Shaw knows. \n\nBased on the Monsterverse from #Legendary, and starring Kurt Russell, Wyatt Russell, Anna Sawai, Kiersey Clemons, Ren Watabe, Mari Yamamoto, Anders Holm, Joe Tippett and Elisa Lasowski, this dramatic saga — spanning three generations — reveals buried secrets and the ways that epic, earth-shattering events can reverberate through our lives.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: \nhttps://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube \n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

{"description":"Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances – either side if the interval – and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"👾 My Discord Server: https://discord.gg/5ZYbXPf\n🔴  Live Channel:  @lukestephenslive \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nStarfield is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was announced during Bethesda's E3 presentation in 2018. The game takes place in a space-themed setting, and is the first new intellectual property developed by Bethesda in 29 years. It is set to release for Windows and Xbox Series X/S on September 6, 2023.\n\nStarfield is an action role-playing video game. Players can switch between a first-person and third-person perspective any time in the game. Starfield features an open world in the form of an area within the Milky Way galaxy, containing both fictional and non-fictional planetary systems, with players being able to land on more than 1,000 planets and an unspecified number of moons and space stations. The majority of the landscapes within the game were procedurally generated; they were subsequently modified and handcrafted content was developed around them. The game will generate the terrain and the alien flora and fauna of a planet depending on the star of its system and its atmosphere, as well as locations of interest as the player approaches a planet. The largest city in the game, New Atlantis, is the largest fictional city Bethesda has developed. As the player explores the game world, they will encounter various non-playable characters (NPCs), some of whom may join the player's crew. Such NPCs may aid the player in combat, carry items, or during confrontations, speak to other NPCs on the player's behalf. Some may comment on choices the player makes. The player may station crew members at any of their constructed outposts. Each companion character has their own unique skills and abilities. Some recruitable NPCs are able to be romanced by the player.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n╔═╦╗╔╦╗╔═╦═╦╦╦╦╗╔═╗\n║╚╣║║║╚╣╚╣╔╣╔╣║╚╣═╣ \n╠╗║╚╝║║╠╗║╚╣║║║║║═╣\n╚═╩══╩═╩═╩═╩╝╚╩═╩═╝\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe and I'll be your bestest friend!\n#starfield #xbox #gaming","title":"A correction to my 'Starfield' review...","duration":1042,"channel_id":"UCe4_UPAmhz2sqorGbF8oZHA","author":"Luke Stephens","date":"20230906","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M1ca57NZTw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1M1ca57NZTw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":320399}}

Picking up immediately after last weeks entry, that saw Ahsoka and co discovering the Eye of Sion after tracing the super star destroyer tracking device. This of course also explains how Hera shows up this week going against the Senators orders. Whether that means some of them are still inline with the Empire remains to be seen but as we know there are imperials in every aspect of the new republic.\n\nAnyway Ahsoka and co ended up landing in the Forest which is when droids were sent out after them and that takes us into the brand new entry. Directed by Pete Ramsey he co-directed Into The Spider-verse and Season 3 Episode 5 Of The Mandalorian.\n\n-\n\nNow we begin with the T6s crew trying to fix the ship so that they can reach out to home one with whats going on.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"AHSOKA Episode 4 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Easter Eggs, Review & Anakin Skywalker!","duration":1611,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230906","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vyRx2t8UDc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vyRx2t8UDc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":298731}}

{"description":"The Exorcist: Believer\nOnly in Theaters October 6\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.  \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar® nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own. \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia O’Neill), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil. \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar® winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before.\n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid’s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela’s neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela’s friend. \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award® nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.  \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty. \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment. \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Yücer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures. \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever","title":"The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer 2","duration":159,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSGeC880CYw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/rSGeC880CYw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":11017958}}

{"description":"Suraya Mohamed | September 5, 2023\nChlöe Bailey and her band were scheduled to fly in the day before this show. But with thousands of flights delayed or canceled at the start of the 4th of July holiday weekend, one member couldn't make it into town. Because the arrangements were designed for two background vocalists, it didn't make sense to have just one and the team decided the ensemble would go without.\n\nBut you would never know something was missing here. Chlöe filled the room with a stunning vocal performance, her positive spirit and light radiated throughout the entire room. The band exuded a special energy too. Right from the first note, they locked into a groove that felt really good. \"Surprise,\" a hit from 2022, started out the set with a sexy bump and grind, R&B vibe that segued right into the body-popping \"Body Do.\" Next up was \"I Don't Mind,\" an afrobeat-infused party jam that really demonstrates her wide vocal range.\n\nThe party mood stayed strong with \"Worried,\" another favorite from her 2023 debut album In Pieces. Its reflective title track speaks to Chlöe's transparency around being vulnerable. She said, \"A lot of times I've been broken down and the cracks will be left, but that doesn't make me imperfect or it doesn't take away any beauty I have deep inside.\" That lovely disposition continued into the last song, \"Cheatback,\" a reminder that even if we think of seeking revenge, karma matters.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Surprise\"\n\"Body Do\" \n\"I Don't Mind\"\n\"Worried\"\n\"In Pieces\"\n\"Cheatback\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nChlöe: vocals \nBrandi Singleton: drums \nKyla Wright: bass\nElise Solberg: keys\nTaylor Gamble: guitar\nArnetta Johnson: trumpet\nCameron Johnson: trumpet\nDerek Dixie: musical direction, drum pad\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Suraya Mohamed \nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Keren Carrión, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Team: Joshua Bryant, Hazel Cills \nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #chloe","title":"Chlöe: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1152,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIeqO2tyhcY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oIeqO2tyhcY/hqdefault.jpg?v=64f2327a","content":{"View count":696817}}
