{"description":"The Grant: https://forms.gle/HBtAdt7zedrtzbZ48\nPizzamas: https://pizzamas.com/discount/HANKSENTME\n\nAs I upload this, I am realizing that there is a pretty huge part of my life that I barely ever talk about publicly. I mean, that is also somewhat true of family things, but business isn't traditionally seen as a thing to be private about. There are lots of people who have big, full careers just talking about the business of their business. I myself have felt the pull to create that kind of content and have done it!\n\nBut I stopped a while back as I realized that talking about the inside operations of my business was always sharing other people's stories as well as my own, and that's weird without asking for permission. Plus, my perception of a situation is never going to be exactly the same as someone else's. So I stopped doing it. I even put a little sign on my computer that says \"DON'T TWEET ABOUT WORK\" to remind me. Even this video felt like it was on the edge of sharing too much, though it is almost all about me. \n\nI feel like there's a relationship between the \"I tweet about what a good boss I am boss\" and the \"wife guy.\" And we've seen times when those bosses hve proved that they are not great bosses. I am also not a great boss...I know that there are some out there, but it's not an easy thing to do. It's especially hard when you have both the inclination and opportunity to be constantly distracted by other things!\n\nSo yeah, that's why I don't talk about the biggest part of my professional life on the internet. If my businesses were just my business, I would, but it's not. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com","title":"I Quit","duration":576,"channel_id":"UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA","author":"vlogbrothers","date":"20231006","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjz3lGV6Tuw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jjz3lGV6Tuw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":444164}}

To make and fire bricks, a workspace protected from the rain must be made to protect the bricks from dissolving before they are fired. Built in a previous video, the hut was used as a space to fire the bricks. The firing went well with no issues with the thatch catching fire due to the height of the roof above the kiln.\nIn addition to the hut being a place to make bricks, I made a charcoal mound in the space left over to make charcoal, a fuel for smelting iron. I had a previous charcoal mound out in the weather but the rain was an issue keeping the wood damp before getting a chance to fire it. So I made a 75 cm diameter re-useable charcoal mound and it produced 6 and a half pots of charcoal. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #brickmaking  #charcoal","title":"Primitive Technology: Brick and Charcoal Production","duration":1129,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20231005","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjBTKe8Y44c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PjBTKe8Y44c/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":758106}}

{"description":"Today AD is welcomed by Jon Batiste and Suleika Jaouad to tour their beautiful home in Brooklyn, New York. With multiple Grammys for Batiste’s album 'We Are' and Jaouad’s bestselling book, 'Between Two Kingdoms', this powerhouse couple wanted a home in which they could live and create simultaneously. After viewing close to 70 properties, it was an 1890s Brooklyn Italianate that finally felt like the One. Interior designer Hallie Goodman helped the couple create a soul-filled home, bringing together their Tunisian and New Orleanian roots in what they’ve penned the “Tunisiana” style. But what truly brought their home together was a wedding ceremony–mid-renovation, upon the return of Suleika’s leukemia, the couple tied the knot in their living room. And after a lengthy hospital stay spent scouring the web for thrifted treasures, Batiste and Jaouad’s home was finally ready for a proper homecoming. “I entered the hospital in winter. The day I was discharged was sunny and fully spring. I was weak, in need of a walker to get around, but I was so happy and relieved. As Jon and I made our way through the house, I had tears in my eyes—not just because it far exceeded our expectations. We had finally made it home.”\r\n\r\nJon Batiste and Suleika Jaouad’s original documentary, 'American Symphony', directed by Matthew Heineman, a portrait of two inimitable artists at a crossroad and a profound meditation on art, love, and the creative process will be released by Netflix globally later this year. Batiste's latest album 'World Music Radio' is now available here: https://jon-batiste.lnk.to/WorldMusicRadioWE\r\n\r\nSee more of Jon and Suleika's Brooklyn home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/jon-batiste-suleika-jaouad-home\r\n\r\nShop Jon and Suleika’s home style!\r\n\r\nAccessories: \r\n(Similar) Marshall Stanmore II Bluetooth Speaker: https://amzn.to/3PF1K0s\r\n(Similar) Chairish Victorian Mahogany Shaving Stand: https://fave.co/48GRZYv\r\n(Similar) Oval Wall Bathroom Mirror: https://amzn.to/3ZHMF2N\r\n(Similar) Etsy Ceramic Hand Brush Holder: https://fave.co/3LKq67U\r\n(Similar) The Sill Bird of Paradise: https://fave.co/46w0JPa\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Gramophone: https://fave.co/3F3Xdja\r\n(Similar) Etsy Kilim Pillow Cover: https://fave.co/3RMzjjQ\r\n(Similar) Etsy Gold Leaf Louis Phillipe Mirror: https://fave.co/46feH8q\r\n\r\nLighting: \r\n(Similar) Etsy Mushroom Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3LNs2wu\r\nEtsy Stilnovo Desk Lamp: https://fave.co/46zcGnf\r\n(Similar) Etsy Minimal Wall Sconce: https://fave.co/3ZEd29K\r\n(Similar) West Elm Adjustable Task Lamp: https://fave.co/3rCouGs\r\n\r\nRugs & wallpaper: \r\n(Similar) Revival Rugs Hart Jute Rug: https://fave.co/3ZDBdW0\r\n(Similar) Etsy Floral Wallpaper Lillies: https://fave.co/3F6Ti56\r\n(Similar) Etsy African Kilim Rug: https://fave.co/3thJVgr\r\n(Similar) Target Contemporary Ornamental Rug: https://goto.target.com/EKG0BX\r\n\r\nFurniture: \r\n(Similar) Anthropologie Elowen Swivel Desk Chair: https://fave.co/45gyov5\r\n(Similar) Modway Tufted Blue Velvet Sofa: https://amzn.to/3ZHOuwz\r\n(Similar) 1stdibs Thonet Cafe Chairs, Set of 4: https://fave.co/3LM0ZSb\r\nWayfair Bari Tufted Swivel Chair: https://fave.co/48R9q8T\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nDirector: Alice Roth; Hiatt Woods; Jasia Kaulbach\r\nDirector of Photography: Eric Brouse\r\nEditor: Tristen Rogers\r\nHost: Jon Batiste; Suleika Jaouad\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nSenior Producer: Vara Reese\r\nLine Producer: Joseph Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Brandon Fuhr\r\nProduction Manager: Melissa Heber\r\nProduction Coordinator: Fernando Davila\r\nCamera Operator: Anne-Marie Halovanic\r\nAudio Engineer: Gabe Quiroga\r\nProduction Assistant: Ryan Coppola\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nAdditional Editor: Paul Tael\r\nAssistant Editor: Justin Symonds\r\nColorist: Oliver Eid\n\nWant even more AD?

The Three-Way Knockouts are also back. This time, however, artists will select their own songs to perform.\n\nOnce the Live Performance Shows begin, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast. This time, the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists. In the end, one artist will be named \"The Voice\" and receive the grand prize of a recording contract.\n \nGifted 17-Year-Old's Voice on \"Golden Slumbers\" Leaves Coaches Speechless | The Voice Blinds | NBC\nhttps://youtu.be/HGyQOGe2ghA\n\nThe Voice\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","title":"Gifted 17-Year-Old's Voice on \"Golden Slumbers\" Leaves Coaches Speechless | The Voice Blinds | NBC","duration":355,"channel_id":"UCpdK1NLHxEUGXc1gq2NxkTw","author":"The Voice","date":"20231004","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGyQOGe2ghA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HGyQOGe2ghA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1829547}}

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 $8k per night villa!\n01:27 Royal Villa tour\n02:00 how did we get here?\n03:04 full resort tour: Conrad Bora Bora\n09:00 Kardashian’s stayed here!\n12:18 swimming with manta rays\n16:30 Presidential Villa tour!!🙌🏻\n25:00 Nate attempts to win 5 free nights😍\n27:45 Bloops","title":"We Stayed in Bora Bora's Most Expensive Overwater Villa","duration":1738,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDIp0Vu9iII","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NDIp0Vu9iII/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1017886}}

Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMB01F5ZJCRFJBFO","title":"We Left for a Cabin in the Woods","duration":1325,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQGWIkKB8l8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JQGWIkKB8l8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":135879}}
