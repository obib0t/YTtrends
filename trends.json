His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"We Got the Tractor STUCK In the Yard - FULL Grain Cart of Soybeans","duration":1077,"channel_id":"UCp0rRUsMDlJ1meYAQ6_37Dw","author":"Millennial Farmer","date":"20230114","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klet1gS6K5o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Klet1gS6K5o/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":353479}}
{"description":"Roblox Combat Warriors is a fighting game where players use a variety of weapons to defeat their opponents.\n\nThis game is a free-for-all arena. After defeating another player, the victor and everyone who assisted in the kill get money that they can use to purchase abilities and better weapons.\n\nTo get money fast, you’ll need to be good at the game and learn the mechanics.\nParrying is essential in defeating the opponent. If a parry is successful, your opponent will be stunned for a few seconds which will result in a guaranteed frag. Other technics, such as sliding and super jump, will improve your odds of catching up and evading others, thus improving your KDA. For more advanced tips and tricks, please watch other tutorials since this video is a funny montage with edits.\n\nI had a pay 2 win moment and just bought the chainsaw and the dragon slayer. So I will have the max level weapons in the gameplay. This video is pre-update, so all the contents such as the new black hole disaster, Yoru heavy weapon and weapons skills that came after the update won't be in it because the video would have been too long.\n\nAfter playing alone for a while, I called in the boys to play together and ganked some people for fun. We chose to use fists because of its funny execution animation. After we got bored, we decided to raid the game with a Roman army for fun. \n\nWe managed to rally 30 people for the invasion all dressed up as Romans legionnaires. However, we would be constantly nuked and or hit with a missile shower. So after a while, we just decided to do a colosseum fight and a drafted versus Romans battle in a private server. \n\nI hope you enjoyed watching me and my friends play/raid this game. There were some codes for this game but I just P2W so I don't know about them. There were a lot of hackers using scripts but I cut those parts out. The disasters and other try hard sweats were a pain to deal with.\n\nBut still, it was still really fun game, I enjoyed it.\n\nLike always, this Roblox Combat Warriors video is filled with a crap ton of unfunny jokes and dead memes in the form of a montage/funny moments. I hope you enjoyed watching us fighting noobs and raiding them. Don’t forget to subscribe, like and comment E.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis video contains a crap load of dead memes and bad jokes.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.","title":"Roblox Combat Warriors: The Chainsaw RoMan","duration":1066,"channel_id":"UCH6sNLmH-rsATLffdpGYscQ","author":"Tank Fish","date":"20230114","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wxlVkzZ_mw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/-wxlVkzZ_mw/hqdefault.webp?v=63c087bf","content":{"View count":367418}}

{"description":"Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n\n_________FAQs__________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

It’s Me, Margaret. has impacted generations with its timeless coming of age story, insightful humor, and candid exploration of life’s biggest questions. In Lionsgate’s big-screen adaptation, 11-year-old Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) is uprooted from her life in New York City for the suburbs of New Jersey, going through the messy and tumultuous throes of puberty with new friends in a new school. She relies on her mother, Barbara (Rachel McAdams), who is also struggling to adjust to life outside the big city, and her adoring grandmother, Sylvia (Kathy Bates), who isn’t happy they moved away and likes to remind them every chance she gets. The film also stars Benny Safdie (Licorice Pizza, Good Time) and is written for the screen and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig (The Edge of Seventeen), based on the book by Judy Blume, and produced by Gracie Films’ Academy Award® winner James L. Brooks (Best Picture, 1983 – Terms of Endearment), alongside Julie Ansell, Richard Sakai, Kelly Fremon Craig, Judy Blume, Amy Lorraine Brooks, Aldric La’auli Porter, and executive produced by Jonathan McCoy.","title":"Are You There God?

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #3860 #HeatTucked #OfficialMusicVideo","title":"Quando Rondo - Heat Tucked [Official Music Video]","duration":167,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20230111","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab8g35-T81g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ab8g35-T81g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":540470}}

{"description":"Thanks to Keeps for sponsoring this video! Head to https://keeps.com/SCREENCRUSH to get a special offer.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's newest trailer is here, and we have our first clear look at the new big bad of the MCU's multiverse saga, Kang the Conqueror! In this video we talk about Kang's connection to Shang-Chi, Ms. Marvel, and how this all feeds into Avengers: Secret Wars.\n\nThanks for supporting our channel! Check out our MERCH Store Here → https://http://shopzeroedition.com/collections/screen-crush-merch\n\nGo here → http://screencrush.com/\nTikTok → https://www.tiktok.com/@screencrushnews\nLike us → https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush\nFollow us → https://twitter.com/screencrushnews\nGet our newsletter → http://screencrush.com/newsletter/\n\nWritten and Hosted by Ryan Arey (http://twitter.com/ryanarey)\nEdited by Harriet Lengel-Enright, Randolf Nombrado, Colton Ogburn, and Ethan Lavinsky\n\n#kang #Quantumania #EasterEggs \n\nI think that Scott Lang is gonna die in this movie. I’ll explain why a little later, and also this trailer seems to confirm some theories weve had about how Kang connects to shang chi, the eternal, and ms marvel. It is all connected. So let's break this thing down.\n \n[trailer opening]. Right off the bat, this is a much darker trailer than what we’re used to seeing in ant man movies. We have the foreboding music, the shot at sunset, as if to say that the sun is setting on score’s time as ant man.  Reminds me a lot of the first trailer for Age of Ultron [clip]. \n\nThe shot is of San Francisco, of course where Ant Man 1 and 2 took place, but also the setting of Shang Chi's opening. That movie was directed by destin daniel cretton, who is now going to helm Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. This is a lot like the Russo brothers, who directed two Captain America films that shaped the final two Avengers films, INfinity war and Secret wars. So Ithink Cretton was chosen because Shang Chi did a lot of the groundwork to set up the Kang Dynasty. Maybe the people of Ta Lo are from alternate timelines, or the quantum realm.\n\nThen we have the mystery of the rings origin and the beacon they send out at the end of the movie, which this trailer gives us a major hint about.\n\nDoug: What is it?\n\nJust be patient, I’m getting there. So we see shots of Scott's life going well for him. In the last trailer we saw that he was given a plaque at the baskin robbins where he was fired [they always find out]. And they even retired his uniform, incorrect name tag and all. Ms marvel mentioned his successful podcast [clip]. And even wakanda forever had a bit on the news ticker about his best selling book, big me little me,\n\nSo Scott is very much taking advantage of his fame, but he still pines for his rosebud, the time he missed in the quantum realm. \n\nKang narrates [you’re an avenger]. And the D23 footage included a line that has not been in a  trailer, where Kang adds “have I killed you before?” which means that kang has killed many versions of the avengers across many realities.\n\nBut he likely has not encountered a scott lang before. And maybe this is why he realizes that Scott is the key to getting what he needs. And to emphasize this, the first shots of Scott as any man show him being really adept at using his powers–he breaks his fall by becoming a giant man. He’s the best he’s ever been at being a hero, and a far cry from this [anyone have any orange slices].\n\nThen we see that, despite his fame and success, Scott really just wants back the time with his daughter. The image of Cassie on his phone is still her as a little girl. And now,in the present day, she’s getting arrested. She has always taken after her dad. And since her dad was locked up in jail, it makes sense that she would follow suit. Except she was probably arrested at a protest of something, judging by her shirt which is anti-global warming.\n\nThe shot of Cassie in prison is intercut with Scott walking toward the camera with the pyms. Cleev framing, because cassie was all alone, while scott was off doing superhero stuff. And this ias kag narrates [but you’ve lost a lot of time]\n\nDoug: yeah what does kang mean by that, lost time?\n\nWell, first let me explain who Kang is in the comics, because that will help you to understand who he is in this movie.","title":"ANT-MAN: QUANTUMANIA Trailer BREAKDOWN: Every Easter Egg + Secret Wars EXPLAINED","duration":1524,"channel_id":"UCgMJGv4cQl8-q71AyFeFmtg","author":"ScreenCrush","date":"20230110","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKjXEzV10UY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKjXEzV10UY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":472930}}

{"description":"(AP) — The 6-year-old Virginia student who shot and wounded his teacher pulled the handgun from a backpack and shot her while she was teaching his first-grade class, a police chief said.\n\nNewport News Police Chief Steve Drew on Monday offered the first description of how the shooting happened. He had previously said that the shooting was not accidental and declined to elaborate.\n\nHe said the student pulled the gun out, pointed at the teacher and fired at her. He said there was no physical struggle over the gun preceding the gunshot. No students were injured.\n\nDrew said that the gun had been legally purchased by the child’s mother in York County. It was in the child’s residence, he put it in his back pack and brought it to school, the chief said.\n\nThe teacher who was wounded Friday in the shooting, Abby Zwerner, was in stable condition Monday at an area hospital. Describing her as a hero, Drew said he had spoken to her and one of her biggest concerns was for her students.\n\nDrew said after the shooting, the boy was physically restrained by a school employee and that he struck the employee. The boy was taken away in a police car.\n\nA candlelight vigil in honor of Zwerner was planned for Monday at 6:30 p.m.\n\nPrincipal Briana Foster Newton said in an update on the school’s website that the school will be closed for the week.\n\nPolice have declined to describe what led to the altercation or any other details about what happened in the classroom, citing the ongoing investigation. They have also declined to say how the boy got access to the gun or who owns the weapon.\n\nVirginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty. Authorities have not specified where the boy was being held.\n\nOn Monday morning, several parents, grandparents and community members gathered with a local pastor in an open patch of grass outside the school.\n\nAmong them was parent Eric Billet, who said each of his three children in the Newport News school system, two of whom go to Richneck, has reacted differently to the shooting.\n\nBillet’s son who is in middle school has raised concerns about school security, telling his dad that he felt safer at theme parks, which the boy argued had better security than his school. His second-grade son is doing better, Billet said, fist-bumping a police officer on his way out of school Friday.\n\nHis daughter, a fourth-grader, has had nightmares every night, Billet said.\n\nBut at the same time, he said, “she was also disappointed she couldn’t go to school this week.”","title":"What we know now about the 6-year-old school shooter in Newport News, Virginia","duration":859,"channel_id":"UC9ha3sh4YTCSK83dH6OlWTw","author":"WTVR CBS 6","date":"20230109","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nQUaH68eYw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2nQUaH68eYw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2102497}}
