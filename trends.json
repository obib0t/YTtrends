The trailer showcases each element‚Äîair, earth, water and fire‚Äîand what sets them apart according to Ember, a quick-witted and fiery woman who‚Äôs always stayed close to home in Firetown. In ‚ÄúElemental,‚Äù which opens in theaters on June 16, she finally ventures out of her comfort zone to explore this spectacular world born from the imaginations of Pixar‚Äôs filmmakers and specifically crafted for the big-screen experience. Element City is inspired by big cities around the globe and embraces theorized contributions from each elemental community‚Äîfrom giant pine-tree-like buildings and waterfall skyscrapers to a tornado-shaped arena called Cyclone Stadium. \n\nJoining the previously announced voice cast including Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as Ember and Wade, respectively, are Ronnie del Carmen as Ember‚Äôs soon-to-be retired dad, Bernie; Shila Ommi as Ember‚Äôs love-seeking mom, Cinder; Wendi McLendon-Covey as Wade‚Äôs stormy and Air-Ball-loving boss, Gale; Catherine O‚ÄôHara as Wade‚Äôs welcoming mom, Brook; Mason Wertheimer as Ember‚Äôs admiring earth neighbor, Clod; and Joe Pera as an overgrown city bureaucrat, Fern.\n \nDirected by Peter Sohn, produced by Denise Ream, p.g.a., and executive produced by Pete Docter, ‚ÄúElemental‚Äù features a screenplay by John Hoberg & Kat Likkel and Brenda Hsueh with story by Sohn, Hoberg & Likkel and Hsueh.

Can you prevent enemies from teleporting away and making you miss your shots? All of that and so much more is included in this video. I hope you enjoy and learn something interesting!

{"description":"And why that‚Äôs a big deal.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nFor the first time in six decades, China‚Äôs population is shrinking, and it‚Äôs predicted it could create a demographic crisis. That‚Äôs because China isn‚Äôt just shrinking, it‚Äôs also aging. And the majority of Chinese couples are not considering having more than one child. Because of this, China is predicted to lose nearly 50 percent of its population by 2100. \n\nChina‚Äôs population decline can be traced back to the restrictive family-planning policies launched in the 1970s and an impressive economic boom fueled by China‚Äôs huge labor force. \nChina‚Äôs modernization brought rapid urbanization, rising income levels, and better education to large parts of China. Combined, these policies and growth have given China one of the lowest birth rates in the world. \n\nToday, China is trying to reverse its population decline. Not just because an aging population is hard to sustain economically, but because China‚Äôs impressive economic growth, until now, has relied on its people. As China‚Äôs population challenges deepen over time, it might have to rethink how to grow its economy and care for its citizens. \n\nYou can explore China‚Äôs birth and death rate data via the United Nations Population portal, here:\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/MORT/Deaths/156\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/FERT/Births/156\n\nAs well as the country‚Äôs total population and predictions here:\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/156\n\nHere are some key facts about China‚Äôs declining population from Pew Research:\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/05/key-facts-about-chinas-declining-population/\n\nYou can read some surprising details about China‚Äôs family planning policies ‚Äî for example,  the One-Child Policy was actually less impactful than the Later, Longer, Fewer campaign ‚Äî here: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/martinwhyte/files/challenging_myths_published_version.pdf\n\nHere‚Äôs an overview of China‚Äôs economic development from the World Bank:\nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview\n\nAnd a report on China‚Äôs income gap:\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/china-income-gap-rural-urban\n\nFor an in-depth look at the cruelty and human cost of China‚Äôs One-Child policy, I recommend the documentary One Child Nation by Nanfu Wang:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/independentlens/documentaries/one-child-nation/\n\nYou can explore population pyramids from across the world on the US Census Bureau‚Äôs website:\nhttps://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/country?COUNTRY_YEAR=2023&COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2023\n \nFinally, our expert, Professor Wang Feng, believes China‚Äôs population growth can be framed in a positive light.

{"description":"Undefeated two-time super middleweight world champion David ‚ÄúThe Mexican Monster‚Äù Benavidez retained his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title with a bruising unanimous decision victory over former world champion Caleb Plant in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions. The judges‚Äô final tallies were 117-111, 116-112 and 115-113.\n \nThe highly anticipated showdown between super middleweight rivals turned into the intriguing clash of styles that many predicted it would be, as Plant‚Äôs boxing acumen carried the early action until the brute force and high-volume power punching of Benavidez took over. After 12 grueling rounds in front of a sold out arena, the two fighters squashed their years long beef, embracing and expressing their mutual respect.\n\n‚ÄúI know there was a lot said between us but in the end we settled this like men,‚Äù said Benavidez. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy we gave the fans the best rivalry of the year or the last five years. I‚Äôm just very happy.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big rivalry but that‚Äôs what boxing is all about,‚Äù said Plant. ‚ÄúWe came here and settled it like men. I take nothing from David. We haven‚Äôt been the best of friends but we got into the ring and we settled it like men. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do. He‚Äôs a helluva fighter.‚Äù\n \nAccording to CompuBox, Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) held a large advantage in power punches landed (180-68) but also out-landed Plant in jabs (30-23). Plant (22-2, 13 KOs) was the busier fighter, throwing 624 to Benavidez‚Äôs 551, but was unable to deter the late round onslaught from Benavidez.\n \n‚ÄúI knew I had to take it step by step and round by round,‚Äù said Benavidez. ‚ÄúCaleb is a tough fighter. He‚Äôs not going to give you everything in the first few rounds so you have to find him. But I feel like I didn‚Äôt just show that I was a power puncher tonight. I showed that I had defense and head movement and I was able to move around the ring and cut the ring off really good.‚Äù\n \nPlant‚Äôs movement appeared to give Benavidez trouble throughout the early action, as Plant consistently landed two to three punch combinations and escape Benavidez‚Äôs counters. It wasn‚Äôt until round eight that Plant‚Äôs movement began to slow down and his attempts at holding were increasingly thwarted.\n \n‚ÄúI was trying to hold him when necessary, punch him when necessary, and throw my combinations when necessary,‚Äù said Plant. ‚ÄúBut when the best get in there with the best, you roll the dice and someone is going to come out with their hand raised and someone will come up short. And one thing that I pride myself on is that I roll with the best in the world. I haven‚Äôt ducked anyone and maybe we can have a rematch in the future.‚Äù\n \nAs the fight moved into the championship rounds, Benavidez pushed forward more aggressively, busting Plant‚Äôs nose and peppering him with short hooks from all angles. Plant stayed on his feet for the final bell, but his final attempts to turn the tide were thwarted by Benavidez. Asked post fight about his future plans, Benavidez set his sights squarely on undisputed 168-pound champion Canelo Alvarez.\n \n‚ÄúI just want to tell everyone that I have a lot of respect for Canelo Alvarez but he has to give me that shot now,‚Äù said Benavidez. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what everyone wants to see. Let‚Äôs make it happen.\nNow the fans are calling for this fight, the legends are calling for this fight, so let‚Äôs make it happen.‚Äù\n\n#DavidBenavidez #CalebPlant #BenavidezPlant\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Benavidez vs Plant HIGHLIGHTS: March 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":106,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20230326","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd74xRh5GQw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bd74xRh5GQw/hqdefault.jpg?v=64201ac7","content":{"View count":1096701}}

{"description":"Lake Mead is one of the largest reservoirs in the United States. In 2022, it dropped to record low levels, and nearly reached dead-pool status. But today, the reservoir's condition is very different. Water Levels are rising, and snowpack on the Colorado River is reaching record high levels. Therefore, how what does the future hold for Lake Mead, and how will rising water levels affect the future of this reservoir? \n\nThank you for Watching, and consider subscribing if you enjoyed the video. \n\n#lakemead #coloradoriver #drought","title":"The Real Reason Lake Mead is Rising","duration":481,"channel_id":"UC8MzgBGB-6UjVac7SHH2bHQ","author":"Arkive","date":"20230325","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvXa4MGYhyQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvXa4MGYhyQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":712454}}

{"description":"Stacie shares her experience with tiny house living, including some important lessons learned about designing, financing, and finding a parking spot for a tiny house, all from the perspective of a former apartment dweller in the city who made the leap to move to a tiny home in a rural mobile home park.\n\nYou can follow and find out more about Stacie's tiny home experience here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@CasaDuroTinyHome\n\nStacie had her home custom-built and was able to pay a deposit and obtain a line of credit to cover the remainder of the cost.  In the video, she suggests saving in advance if possible, and she also mentions chattel loans, builder financing, and financing from the previous owner as other financial loan options to explore (since many lending institutions and banks might not issue a conventional mortgage for a tiny house on wheels).\n\nFor parking, Stacie wanted a legal setup and spent a lot of time following leads for parking her home on private land, but they often fell through because the municipality wouldn't approve it, or because the landowners changed their minds.  At the last minute, she was able to find a spot to park it at a trailer park.  Since moving there she's had the chance to visit neighbouring trailers and wishes she had checked them out as an option before having a tiny home custom-built.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.

Vy and Daniel surprised me with balloons, streamers, a birthday cake, and Spider-man, when I returned home from cancer treatment (radiation). I was really happy and thanked them, but I told them that I can't have any more interruptions. I was about to start my phone call with Scholastic but suddenly a gorilla showed up in my backyard. He sang me happy birthday, told a number of cringy monkey jokes and was on his way. Later, in the middle of my meeting with Target, a donkey walked into my yard! I had to cut my meeting short and go outside to play with the donkey.

After lots of back-and-forth chances, Joselu scored with a beautiful header into the left corner to extend Spain‚Äôs lead to 2-0 in his debut game. A minute later, Joselu scored again with a left-footed shot to the bottom right corner to extend Spain‚Äôs lead 3-0.

We explore that using numbers generated from our last episode, where the Z06 beat a Porsche 911 GT3 (992), an Audi R8 V10 Performance, and almost kept up with a Ducati Panigale V4 SP2.\n\nUsing his signature time-freeze technique, veteran automotive journalist Jason Cammisa shows us the outcome of the race and explains how it happened by walking back through slow-mo time at the finish line.\n\nThe Corvette E-Ray combines the Z06's wide body with the base Stingray's 6.2-liter LS2 V-8 and a front-mounted, 160-hp electric motor. Launches are now wheelspin-free and no-drama as the E-Ray rockets from 0-60 in just 2.4 seconds ‚Äî making this the quickest Corvette in history.\n\nAnd, at 3925 lb, the heaviest.
