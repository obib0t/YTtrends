Astroneer is set during the 25th century Intergalactic Age of Discovery, where Astroneers explore the frontiers of outer space, risking their lives in harsh environments to unearth rare discoveries and unlock the mysteries of the universe.\n\nIn this space sandbox adventure, players can work together to build custom bases above or below ground, create vehicles to explore a vast solar system, and use terrain to create anything they can imagine. A player‚Äôs creativity and ingenuity are the key to thriving on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\nReshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\n\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain!\nSurvive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\n\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to the mysterious core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\nSnap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\n\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can all be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\nPlay with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\n\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox.\nDiscover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system.\n\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.","title":"I Broke Astroneer in Half Using Dynamite and Trains","duration":1034,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220925","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkDfIclJoHA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HkDfIclJoHA/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":846139}}

{"description":"In this video I'm restoring a pair of antique German headphones. I've found these headphones at an online auction for $30 and I thought they look pretty cool for a restoration project.\nUnfortunately they didn't work anymore. I measured the coils and three of the four were broken. That fact put this little project to a whole new challenge. It required a ton of research to completely understanding every single detail of its function to remake the coils and such. After some trial and error I managed to remake the broken bobbins and rewind the coils. The tricky part was that both  coils are connected with eachother at the beginning of the windings in the core. I had to make a special jig, so I could clamp both coils when winding the second one.\nThe original paint had some kind of a structure in it. It was black matte with some kind of a hammertone pattern. Unfortunately I was not able to find such paint, so I went with regular black matte. To not loose the were fine writings and logo I only applied a very thin layer of primer and coat.\nThe Bakelite pieces just required some wet sanding and a good polish and they looked like new again. Old Bakelite might contain asbestos, that's why I wet sanded them so there won't be any sanding dust.\nI cleaned the membranes with scotch brite after a 24h bath in rust remover. To get rid of the pitting I sanded it with 240 grit sandpaper. I was already down to 0.13mm from 0.2mm thickness, but there was still pitting visible and I just sanded one side. To get the best possible sound at the end I decided to remake both membranes with new 0.2mm steel foil. To match the original membranes I also painted the center black matte.\nI nickel plated all the screws and the two brackets like they were originally. The brackets were a little bit weird, because they were two identical ones instead of pair of mirrored ones. I fixed that pretty easy by just bending the shaft on one ion the opposite direction.\nI was very lucky that the cable was in nearly perfect condition. It had absolutely no visible damge or fraying, just lost a bit of color. I just had to shorten them. Todays headphones all work with AC, these however back then worked with DC. Therefore the polarity matters. I also marked all endings of the cable with red and black threads, so did I made a red and black plastic cover for the plugs. \nIn the end I'm very happy how these headphones have turned out. The color combination of the black matte with the shiny black Backelite parts look very classy together with the shiny nickel plated parts and the crispy clean looking knurling is the cherry on top.\n\nI hope you like my work and the video.\n\nHuge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and especially to:\nAdel AlSaffar\nAlex McGeorge\nAlfonso Baz\nAlistair Moor\nAmar.k\nAnthony Eufemio\nArron Metcalf\nArthur\nBendurion\nBrenna Redpath\nChris walter\nDavid Barker\nEdward Conway\nEmbiss\nHaitham Al Zir\nisaac\njames lowe\nJean Ceppi\nJohn Shebanow\nJosh Denny\nJosh Ledford\nJosh Wasserman\nJoshua Bentley\nJoshua Scher\nKar Marsten\nLambda GPU Workstations\nLordPi\nMellissa Marcus\nMonte Gibbs\nNathaniel Carver\nNoLoneSurvivor\nPat Thrasher\nPeter Riddett\npotokslow\nSophieHDLM\nSteve Bothe\nStevenVR\nTyler Carruth\nVaushVidya\nVickie Bligh\nVince Valenti\nWill Black\nXavier Carbel\nYale Baker\nYuri Zapuchlak\nAdam Holtzclaw\nAlipasha Sadri\nAndrew Egerton\nAndrew Phillips\nArni Bjorgvinsson\nBonnie Williamson\nBrian Hoerl\nChad Bryant\nCharles Copenhaver\nCrystal Cash\nDamien Fuller-Sutherland\nDaniel Trejo\nDaniel Varga\nDave Hardware\nDavid Ebert\nDavid P Hruska\nDavid Powell\nEndless Mike\nGrant Daniel\nHaley McFadden\nHard_Boiled\nJack Curry\njake meckley\nJason Koi\nJeff Smith\nJeremy Cole\nJohan Vergeer\nJo√´l Franusic\nKen Rosso\nKevin Robinson\nKurt Gazow\nL Rlta\nLiam Rafle\nLina Machina\nMarc Cerisier\nMarc Staedelin\nMary Casella\nMellissa McConnell\nMicheal Bier\nMichael Lamp\nMossy_Forrest\nNik\nPasacal Schmikal\nPeter Cyprian\nRebecca Miller\nRegis Vincent\nRob\nRobert Galyen\nSarah Langlais\nScott Marshall\nStefan Kronander\nSteven Michalcewicz\nSuiros\nSvenja Kuckla\nThanny\nTim Holt\nTom Wallace\nTrevor Kam\nTucker Ifft\nVictoria Emmenegger\nWilliam\n\nMy camera:\nPanasonic HC-VX11\n\nIf you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

{"description":"The drama surrounding the Boston Celtics and especially their head coach Ime Udoka has been the main topic these past few days. And it culminated with the team suspending Udoka for a full season. This came as a shock to some, and it sure looks like a very steep penalty. \nSo let me explain what‚Äôs the real reason behind the suspension. What up everybody, my name is Stefan and this is Heat Check. Let‚Äôs get into it.\nShams Charania has new info on this topic that gives us a different perspective of the whole story.\nIn his latest article on the Athletic, Charania writes that Some members of the Celtics organization first became aware of the relationship in July. At that time, team leadership was led to believe by both parties that the relationship was consensual. But the woman recently accused Udoka of making unwanted comments toward her ‚Äî leading the team to launch a set of internal interviews. After which, the final decision was made.\nNow this is a new moment in this whole situation and a big one at that. This is the exact reason for why the code of conduct even exists.\nRemember the Dallas Mavericks debacle? There was a huge investigation done on Mavs office members that revealed sexual harassments, domestic violence, and all kinds of other detrimental behaviour. It ended ugly, and it even involved the owner Marc Cuban as a person who knew some of these issues but tried to come to settlements and confidentiality agreements.\nWell this is the exact scenario that the Celtics want to avoid. A case by case falloff and corrosion of the team‚Äôs culture.\nEven with having this code of conduct and these workplace guidelines, you see with this new info that they were still hesitant to implement when they found out about the affair.\nBut once there was even the slightest change of tone by the woman, accusing Udoka of making certain comments, the team saw how this could be a slippery slope and how the issue might snowball into a much bigger thing.\nThe woman could decide to sue, or go public with accusations, and her side of the story, all kinds of scenarios might develop from this. And you can see how it can become very ugly very soon. \nWith this suspension however, I feel like Boston set the bar high. The standards to which the team members will be held, and the expectations for how they should conduct themselves are nothing short of professional.\nThis is not some end of the bench guy, or an unknown team member, but rather the head coach we‚Äôre talking about. Possibly the greatest piece for their incredible turnaround and the road to the finals last year.\nIt would be very tempting for a team to forgive and forget when it comes to a prominent piece of their success. But with this move, their action is loud and clear. The franchise, and the organization comes before any single member of it.\nIt‚Äôs just unfortunate that it might be a step backwards for this team when it comes to actual basketball. This sudden coaching change for this season, along with the latest news that Robert Williams will have surgery and miss 4-6 weeks, it‚Äôs a huge blow. And suddenly the odds of them reaching the finals again have just plummeted.\nLet me know in the comments if you think that the Celtics can survive all of this. That‚Äôs it for now, subscribe and talk to you in the next one. Peace out.","title":"EXPOSED: The Real Reason For The Ime Udoka Suspension","duration":211,"channel_id":"UCmwxBk7Af9OnnloGZzp6JnQ","author":"Heat Check","date":"20220923","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgrRmuKMi30","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrRmuKMi30/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":134405}}

{"description":"-An overview of the drama unfolding over the ship channel in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n-Preorder my new book before the holiday rush: https://practical.engineering/book\n\nErrata:\nAt 3:08, the old Harbor Bridge actually does have narrow pedestrian walkways, but they lack connectivity with pedestrian infrastructure on either side of the bridge.\nAt 3:21, a clarification: The ships can't enter the port empty (because they would have too much air draft). That means they can't be fully loaded in the inner harbor because they are already carrying some weight when they enter.\nAt 12:40, I meant to say \"20% above their capacity\"\n\nIn July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
