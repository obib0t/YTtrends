Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable: Shooting nuclear waste into space.

But it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it. \n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Prodcuts designed with ❤ https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3uC1UdP\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3rafoeA\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nIvo Casant, 서현지, Terrence Hamm, Caitlyn, Saeris Sanoora, k-gregory, ADesertCottontail, Tiffany Cale, Ian Pendleton, Samuel Ginty, Catriona Mullan, 범석 고, Alexander Stadnyk, Andrei Albu, Tk AH, Sherry Schuderer, Florian Haydn, jack ruppel, James B, oshra duek, Lorraine Inez Lil, Vinicius Krischke, Josh Evans, Yuri Ibraev, เมธาสิทธิ์ มงคลปัญญาเลิศ, Peter G, T G , Patches, Alice Archer, Paul Faber, Donivan, Call, Antzela Giovani, Mischa Hamby\n\nChapters\n00:00:00 12,023 Calender Announcement\n00:00:20 INTRO\n00:00:57 What is nuclear waste?\n00:02:47 Problem 1: Stuff Ain't Cheap\n00:04:24 Problem 2: Space is hard\n00:06:53 Problem 3: Rockets go Brrrrrrrr\n00:08:06 Conclusion and Opinion Part\n00:09:39 Endcard","title":"Why Don't We Shoot Nuclear Waste Into Space?","duration":655,"channel_id":"UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q","author":"Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell","date":"20221108","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us2Z-WC9rao","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Us2Z-WC9rao/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1953477}}

{"description":"Discover 6️⃣ all-new stories in Disney’s Zootopia+, an Original series streaming Wednesday only on @DisneyPlus. 🐰🐾🐭\n\n“Zootopia+” heads back to the fast-paced mammal metropolis of Zootopia in a short-form series that dives deeper into the lives of some of the Oscar®-winning feature film’s most intriguing residents, including Fru Fru, the fashion-forward arctic shrew; ZPD dispatcher Clawhauser, the sweet-toothed cheetah; and Flash, the smiling sloth who’s full of surprises. The series is directed by Josie Trinidad (Co-Head of Story, “Zootopia”; Head of Story, “Ralph Breaks the Internet”) and Trent Correy (Director, “Once Upon a Snowman” and “Drop”), and produced by Nathan Curtis (Associate Producer, “Encanto” and “Raya and the Last Dragon”). \n\n \n\nEpisodes debuting Nov. 9 include:\n\n1.       Hopp on Board – When Judy boards the train from Bunny Burrow to Zootopia to begin her life as the big city’s first bunny cop, Stu and Bonnie’s youngest daughter, Molly, hitches a ride atop the train, forcing the down-to-earth duo out of their comfort zone and into an action-packed rescue mission.\n\n \n\n2.       The Real Rodents of Little Rodentia – Newly engaged, Fru Fru kicks off wedding planning with enthusiasm and flourish—at least until her scene-stealing cousin Tru Tru arrives to assume the role of Shrew of Honor. A battle for the spotlight ensues until a close call with a giant donut reveals that for better or worse, no one knows you better than family.\n\n \n\n3.       Duke the Musical – After being wrangled and arrested in a giant donut—compliments of Officer Judy Hopps—clever criminal weasel Duke reevaluates his life, pondering where he went wrong—in song. In a musical aptly staged in his own mind, Duke contemplates how to go from a small time crook to the Big Time!\n\n \n\n4.       The Godfather of the Bride – A touching tale about the powerful arctic shrew known as Mr. Big revisits Fru Fru’s big day when he delivers a revelatory father-of-the-bride speech. Taking guests back in time to his days as Mr. Small, a new immigrant to Zootopia, he imparts the wisdom he gained then about the importance of friends, family and community. \n\n \n\n5.       So You Think You Can Prance – ZPD dispatcher Clawhauser persuades his boss, Chief Bogo, to audition for “So You Think You Can Prance.” The stakes are high as the ultimate prize is a dream-come-true opportunity to dance on stage with megastar pop sensation Gazelle.\n\n \n\n6.   Dinner Rush – As super server Sam urgently tries to finish her restaurant shift to make a once-in-a-lifetime Gazelle concert, Flash and Priscilla show up at the last minute with hopes of a once-in-a-lifetime dinner. \n\n \n\nTwitter: @DisneyZootopia, @DisneyPlus, @DisneyAnimation\n\nInstagram: @DisneyPlus, @DisneyAnimation\n\nFacebook: @Zootopia, @DisneyPlus, @DisneyAnimation\n\nYoutube: /Disneyplus, /disneyanimation\n\nTikTok: @DisneyPlus\n\nHashtag: #DisneyPlus","title":"Zootopia+ | Trailer | Disney+","duration":120,"channel_id":"UC_976xMxPgzIa290Hqtk-9g","author":"Walt Disney Animation Studios","date":"20221107","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ6DbWEKyvQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kQ6DbWEKyvQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":743987}}

{"description":"Today’s Doodle celebrates jollof rice, a quintessential West African dish simmered in reduced tomatoes, onions, peppers and regional spices. On this day each year, rice farmers plant and reap a bountiful harvest — as cooks across West Africa prepare to make fresh jollof. Nigeria-based guest artist Haneefah Adam created the artwork and Senegalese jazz musician Hervé Samb composed the music. \n\n\nLearn more :http://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-jollof-rice\n-------\n\nTo follow Google Doodles on YouTube, subscribe to: @GoogleDoodles \nFollow Google Doodles on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/GoogleDoodles","title":"Celebrating Jollof Rice","duration":34,"channel_id":"UCdq61m8s_48EhJ5OM_MCeGw","author":"GoogleDoodles","date":"20221104","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxUid0_e5Sk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/oxUid0_e5Sk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":11136357}}

LMNT has been a huge supporter of the town, I drink it basically every day, so I hope you'll check it out!\n\nThis was a HUGE few weeks at Cerro Gordo. Finally. Finally, after nearly 2 years of battling concrete, the hotel for the American Hotel is DONE. Once again, we found ourselves in a place where no concrete companies would bring their trucks to our town. It was too dangerous, and there were easier jobs elsewhere. \n\nSo instead of sitting back and letting someone else dictate whether a dream happened or not, we got to WORK. In the end, we broke open and mixed 1,500 ninety pound bags of concrete and got the job done. It was one of the craziest few days up here at Cerro Gordo. \n\nI have to give a HUGE shoutout to everyone who has helped out these past few weekends to make this possible - Aaron C, Scotty, Trevor, Phil, Pat, Craig, Dave, Jim, Marty, Aaron S, Hans, Christy, Paul, Daniel, Sabin, Elias, Damien, Richard, Andrew, Victoria, Chris K, Richie, Juan, Freddy, Elliot, Corbin, Jeff, Connor, James, Travis, Jake, Olmo, Brian, and many more!!

He was 34.\nNick Carter took to Twitter on Sunday to say his heart was “broken” at the news.\n“Even though my brother and I have had a complicated relationship, my love for him has never ever faded. I have always held on to the hope that he would somehow, someday want to walk a healthy path and eventually find the help that he so desperately needed,” Carter said.\n“Sometimes we want to blame someone or something for a loss, but the truth is that addiction and mental illness are the real villains here. I will miss my brother more than anyone will ever know. I love you baby brother.”\nThis video shows the Backstreet Boys paying tribute to Aaron. “Not a dry eye in the arena,” Jade H tweeted.\nCredit: Jade H via Storyful","title":"Nick Carter and Backstreet Boys Pay Tearful Tribute to Aaron Carter at London Show","duration":111,"channel_id":"UCtWWry0cgjWi9C0Ye9sh6og","author":"news.com.au","date":"20221107","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE4r9cvzi48","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BE4r9cvzi48/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":632681}}

{"description":"Welcome back to skyrim! Where today we set out on a second attempt of an impossible challenge! Can you beat the survive 100 days in skyrim hardcore challenge? The rules are simple, Legendary difficulty skyrim with survival mode but the added twist that you are not allowed to equip any Armor or weapons. This is the hardest possible challenge skyrim can offer. You are effectively playing at 1 hp and almost anything will kill you and fail the run. Ontop of that in survival mode you must eat and sleep similarly to an indie survival game. You must also balance temperatures which in the cold northern lands of skyrim is rather impossible. \n\nMod Pack Used: https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/jqd9zz\n\nSo sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or surviving 100 days of skyrim hardcore is a task that is simply too impossible for this pro exploiter!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts.

{"description":"NBC News has learned new details about the moment San Francisco police officers arrived at the home of Paul Pelosi during an alleged assault.\r\n\r\nA top ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding fresh answers from the U.S. Capitol Police about security failures that led to a brutal attack on Pelosi’s husband last week, questioning the embattled agency about whether it can keep lawmakers and their families safe.\r\n\r\nHouse Administration Committee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., sent a four-page letter to Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger on Wednesday, saying the attack on Paul Pelosi raises “significant questions about security protections for Members of Congress.” The man who beat Paul Pelosi with a hammer was looking for Nancy Pelosi and later told police that he wanted to hold her hostage and break her kneecaps to make a political point, authorities said.\r\n\r\nThe searing letter lays out a series of questions for Manger and orders the agency to lay out its plans for protecting lawmakers and their families, including how they are interacting with other law enforcement agencies, how officers are trained for such situations and whether there are special plans in place to protect lawmakers in the presidential line of succession, as Pelosi is.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Lofgren, whose panel oversees the Capitol Police, comes as the beleaguered agency is still trying to rebuild after the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, when hundreds of former President Donald Trump’s supporters overwhelmed officers and more than 100 were injured. Threats to lawmakers have skyrocketed in recent years — almost 10,000 threats were investigated last year — and the agency has struggled to protect lawmakers, their families and the Capitol campus with limited resources.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Police issued a statement Wednesday saying they will “fast track” the work they had already been doing to protect members outside of Washington. #WakeUpCLT \r\n\r\nREAD MORE: https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/nation-world/pelosi-attack-capitol-police-safety-concerns/507-6d89c6f2-cfbc-4473-8bc7-950aa48516a9","title":"New details revealed in brutal attack on Paul Pelosi","duration":131,"channel_id":"UC-RxXi2Xws6Uk22vp-sLbGA","author":"WCNC","date":"20221104","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTS1bPKiTZM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VTS1bPKiTZM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":547566}}

It seems like every single week in 2022 there has been a new episode of some kind of Marvle property. The latest one to hit the tiny screen is She-Hulk starring Tatiana Maslany.\n\nShe-Hulk definitely raises some questions. Like what is this show trying to be? Why is Jennifer so amazing at being a Hulk right away? Does that fourth-wall breaking stuff feel kinda weird to anyone else in the grand scheme of the MCU? Can She-Hulk solve all problems moving forward by complaining to Marvel?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the She-Hulk: Attorney at Law! \n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nPitch Meeting Gets An Upgrade (feat.

There's a way to remove these by mixing the clay in suspension and draining that water off leaving the impurities behind. I started by digging a pit to receive the clay. Then dug clay from the creek bed and put it next to the pit in a pile. Water was mixed into the pile and it was allowed to sit for a while. The water/clay mixture was then drained off into the collection pit where it settled. This was done a number of times. After settling and the water seeping out, the pure clay was mixed with grog (crushed old pottery) and made into pots. The pots were fired and of good quality, making a ringing noise when flicked indicating no cracks or weakness. This method of purifying clay saves a lot of time and effort by removing the step of manually removing rocks from the clay body. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Why the Congressional midterms matter so much.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nOn January 6th, 2021 (yes, during the capitol riots) the final Senate race of the 2020 election was called for a Democrat. All of a sudden Democrats had achieved something improbable: trifecta control of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. It transformed the possibilities for Biden’s first two years, giving his party the ability to legislate on their own - which they did.\n\nThe trillion-dollar stimulus, the infrastructure bill, the climate investments of the Inflation Reduction Act — all of that was only possible because of unified Democratic control. But even under divided government, both houses of Congress will still wield an enormous amount of power over national affairs and policy. That’s why the 2022 election isn’t just a referendum on whether Democrats should keep Congress — it’s a question of who gets that power, and how they’ll use it. And there are three ways it could all play out.\n\nOur buds at Vox.com also did this story in text form if you like reading! https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23435135/2022-midterms-congress-republican-democrat\n\nFor more reporting on the 2022 US midterm elections, read up here: https://bit.ly/3U3aGxB \n\nThere are 9 races that could decide the Senate control. Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin are some of the closest contests in the country. Keep up with us here: https://bit.ly/3WoXOnd \n\nChapters:\n475 elections 00:00\n1. What if Democrats keep both houses? 0:46\n2. What if Republicans win the House of Representatives? 1:59\n3. What if Republicans win the Senate? 4:26\nWhose vote matters? 7:01\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate. \n\nFRONTLINE tells the inside stories of activists and journalists risking arrest and imprisonment to protest and speak out about the Kremlin’s war effort — from a young woman whose TikToks have gone viral internationally, to an artist facing up to 10 years imprisonment after posting anti-war stickers in a grocery store, to a university professor whose parents live in Ukraine, to independent reporters seeking the truth about the war — including its death toll among the country’s soldiers, information that Russia has deemed a state secret.\n\nAs Russia’s war on Ukraine approaches its ninth month and evidence of potential war crimes continues to mount, “Putin's War at Home” is a powerful look at the Russian leader’s efforts to stifle domestic criticism — and some of the people in his country who are speaking out anyway.\n \n“Putin’s Russia is based on fear,” one journalist says in the documentary, adding that, “we decided to continue without censorship, whatever the cost.”\n\n#Documentary #InsideRussia #UkraineWar\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS Video App, where more than 300 of our documentaries are available to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\n“Putin’s War at Home” is a Hardcash production for GBH/FRONTLINE in association with ITV.

{"description":"Discover a fairy tale with a wicked twist. Disenchanted, an Original movie, starts streaming November 18 on Disney+. \n\nThe digital soundtrack from Walt Disney Records will be available on Nov. 18 and is available for Pre-Save/Pre-Add at https://presave.umusic.com/disenchanted-soundtrack.\n\nIt has been more than ten years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) wed, but Giselle has grown disillusioned with life in the city, so they move their growing family to the sleepy suburban community of Monroeville in search of a more fairy tale life. Unfortunately, it isn’t the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn’t been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family’s future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.\n \n“Disenchanted” stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Gabriella Baldacchino, with Idina Menzel and James Marsden. Directed by Adam Shankman from a screenplay by Brigitte Hales and a story by J. David Stem & David N. Weiss, and Richard LaGravenese, “Disenchanted” is produced by Barry Josephson, Barry Sonnenfeld, and Amy Adams, with Jo Burn, Sunil Perkash, and Adam Shankman serving as executive producers. The movie features songs with music by 8-time Oscar®-winning composer Alan Menken and lyrics by three-time Oscar-winning lyricist Stephen Schwartz, whose work on “Enchanted” garnered three Academy Award® nominations and a score by Alan Menken.","title":"Disenchanted | Official Trailer | Disney+","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20221101","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY63dfyn7HQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DY63dfyn7HQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2688415}}
