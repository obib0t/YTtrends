{"description":"How Xi Jinping became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nXi Jinping, president of China and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is one of the most powerful political figures in the world. By initiating an unprecedented third term as China’s leader in October, 2022, Xi has signaled that he may plan to remain in power for life – making him the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong to hold unchecked power over the People’s Republic of China. \n\nBut Xi’s connection to Mao goes deeper than a shared outlook that emphasizes unifying the party around a single leader. When Xi was just a young boy, his family – who had held elite party status thanks to his father’s pivotal role in Mao's “Long March” in 1935 – was denounced during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a chaotic decade of purges and persecution that saw even Mao’s closest allies removed from power. During this time, a teenaged Xi was forced to work hard labor in the countryside outside of Beijing, and his father was imprisoned. \n\nXi’s subsequent rise after Mao died in 1976 was a methodical process in using his restored elite status as leverage to gain prominent party positions in rural provinces around China, culminating in his promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007.\n\nFrom there, Xi pulled from Mao’s playbook: purging his political rivals and promoting those with whom he shared close personal ties. This process undid the work of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, to prevent the consolidation of power around a single leader in China. \n\nBy the time his third term began in October 2022, Xi had reshaped the party and Chinese military leadership to be fully packed with Xi loyalists. And even in the face of social upheaval surrounding his failed Zero Covid policy, Xi has shown no sign of giving up any of the power he has consolidated since taking over as leader of the country. \n\n\nFurther reading: \n\nThese books and podcasts below helped us understand Xi Jinping’s rise, Xi’s similarities to Mao, how politics changed in the PRC since its founding, and the structure and culture of the CCP:\n\nCoalitions of the Weak by Victor Shih (Associate Professor in China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego)\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/coalitions-of-the-weak/6E99B6DB73F934166175D872B51DACD0 \n\nChinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era by Cheng Li (scholar and expert in Chinese elite politics) \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/books/chinese-politics-in-the-xi-jinping-era/ \n\nParty of One by Chun Han Wong (Reporter at the Wall Street Journal) \nhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Party-of-One/Chun-Han-Wong/9781982185732\n\nWealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-first Century by Orville Schell and John Delury \nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/161758/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury/\n\nThe Prince by Sue-Lin Wong (Correspondent at The Economist) \nhttps://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-prince\n\nThese databases and papers were also helpful in gaining a better understanding of Xi Jinping’s alliances and the CCP structure under his terms: \n\nDecoding Chinese Politics interactive by Asia Society Policy Institute \nhttps://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/decoding-chinese-politics\n\nCCP Elite Database by UCSD/Victor Shih\nhttps://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/elites/\n\nChina’s Political System in Charts: A Snapshot Before the 20th Party Congress by Susan V.

{"description":"In the co-main event, Jermall Charlo returned to the ring for the first time in 29 months with a spirited, workmanlike and ultimately dominant performance against a very game and durable José Benavídez Jr., the older brother of David Benavídez in their 10-round non-title bout contracted at 163 pounds. Charlo, who holds the WBC middleweight title, was the much larger man, and he pushed Benavídez around the ring with his pole-like jab and hard right hands. It all added up to a wide decision for Charlo by scores of 100-90, 99-91 and 98-92 as Charlo remained undefeated at 33-0 with 22 KOs, while Benavídez dropped to 28-3-1 with 19 KOs. Charlo weighed in at 166.4 pounds at Friday’s weigh-in, compared to Benavídez at 161.2 pounds, but the fight was allowed to continue after both camps agreed. Charlo landed 116 of 334 total jabs for a 35% connect-rate and landed 127 of 279 power punches for a 46% clip.\n\n“I'll be back stronger, just know that,” Charlo said. “I thought about everything that I've been through every round. God's got me. I want to thank everybody who never left my side. I want to thank Al Haymon for understanding me. I know when you're a man it's hard to explain to somebody what you stand for, but I'm happy that I went through what I went through because I showed myself that anything can be done.”\n\nBenavídez, who was stopped by Terence Crawford in the 12th round for a welterweight title in 2018 and was an amateur prodigy, performed well against the larger foe, displaying a granite chin. But after a rusty first round, Charlo took control, exhibiting the skills that have made him one of the most entertaining and skilled fighters in the sport.\n\n“He’s a good fighter, I’m not going to make any excuses,” Benavídez said. “I came to fight. He said he was going to back me up and I didn’t back up. I kept coming forward. The best man won tonight. It’s boxing. I thought it was way closer than the judges said it was. At the end of the day, I lost, and I’m not going to make any excuses. I don’t know if his extra weight had anything to do with it. Maybe. Maybe not. I came prepared. I gave my best.”\n\nCharlo hurt Benavídez with a straight right hand toward the end of the first round after Charlo started slowly, the result of his long layoff. Charlo landed a sharp right uppercut midway through the second. Benavídez briefly hurt Charlo to start the third with a jab-right hand combination, but Charlo responded with an overhand right that snapped Benavídez’s head back with a minute left in the frame, and Charlo unloaded on Benavídez in the fourth as Benavídez covered up under Charlo’s heavy jabs and lefts. Charlo snapped Benavídez’s head back with a right uppercut with 40 seconds left in the sixth, and Charlo hurt Benavídez in the 10th round with a snappy right, as the two exchanged words and eventually buried the bad blood between them when the fight was over and embraced.\n\n#JermallCharlo #CharloBenavidez #JoseBenavidezJr \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Charlo vs Benavidez Jr HIGHLIGHTS: November 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":197,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20231127","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GBFFm8xrTY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5GBFFm8xrTY/hqdefault.jpg?v=65652555","content":{"View count":374393}}

{"description":"David “El Monstruo” Benavídez lived up to his nickname and billings as perhaps the sport’s most destructive offensive weapon as he defended his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title and blitzed former two-division champion Demetrius “Boo Boo” Andrade with a stoppage after the sixth round in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night headlining a Premier Boxing Champions event from Michelob ULTRA Arena at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.\n \nThe ending came after Andrade’s trainer wouldn’t allow their charge to leave the corner to start the seventh round after Benavidez, fighting his first southpaw in seven years, bloodied and pounded Andrade in perhaps the signature performance of his career. Benavídez (28-0, 24 KOs) remained undefeated as Andrade (32-1, 19 KOs) suffered his first loss.\n \n“I think I just solidified myself as a dominant force here,” Benavídez said. “I just reminded everyone who the real champion at 168 is. Who wants to see me versus Canelo? I'm going to be super middleweight champion of the world, three-time world champion. Now just give me the fight that we all want to see. Who wants to see Benavídez versus Canelo?”\n \nBenavídez punctuated his performance with an embrace of Mike Tyson outside the ring following the stoppage. Tyson famously dubbed Benavídez the “Mexican Monster.”\n \n\"I just told Mike Tyson that I love him and thank you so much for the motivation he's given me,” Benavídez said. “It's not every day a boxing legend like Mike Tyson gives people nicknames, so I just want to live up to my name.\n \n“Everybody says I'm not this, I'm not that, I'm flat-footed, I have no defense. This guy probably applied one of the best defenses. He's really good offensively. He could barely even hit me, so I think that says a lot on its own. I just have to keep beating who they put in front of me. I'm the best. I'm going to be the best. I'm going to be a legend by the time I'm done, so whoever you keep putting in front of me, I'll keep knocking them down.\n \n\"Let's give the people what they want to see. They want to see Benavídez versus Canelo.\"\n \nJust as he did against Caleb Plant in March, Benavídez grew stronger and more dangerous as the fight wore on. After Andrade held his own in the opening rounds, Benavídez broke down his 35-year-old opponent with breathtaking efficiently. A looping right hand from Benavídez to the side of the head dropped Andrade for the third time in his career with seconds left in the fourth round. Andrade crumpled to the canvas and rose on shaky legs to survive the round.\n \nBenavídez hurt Andrade again with a left to start the fifth round as he continued to walk Andrade down and land hard punches. Andrade’s right eye started to close midway through the frame as Benavídez teed off on his 35-year-old opponent with a right uppercut and an assortment of short, stinging punches. Andrade took a stand with a minute left in the sixth, uncorking a right uppercut but Benavidez hurt Andrade, a former 2008 U.S. Olympian, with left that had him stumbling across the ring.\n \nIt was a far cry from the start of the fight when Andrade was able to smother Benavídez’s punches, darting in and out and winging shots from odd angles that found their mark. Andrade looked sensational in the first two rounds, while Benavídez bided his time, carefully picking his shots. Andrade started to slow down in the third, allowing Benavídez to unload his brand of destructive, compact punches before the knockdown turned the tide in Benavídez’s favor.  \n \n“I’ll be back – back to the drawing board,” Andrade said. “I moved up in weight classes. I’ll work on my body a little more and I’ll be right back at it. I thought overall I did everything I needed to do to get the bigger man off me. David's definitely a hell of a fighter. Nobody was even willing to get in the ring with him. I tried to become a three-division world champion. That's not far-fetched. David was the man tonight. Benavídez is the bigger man.”\n\n#BenavidezAndrade #DavidBenavidez #DemetriusAndrade \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Benavidez vs Andrade HIGHLIGHTS: November 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":187,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20231126","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtH8RT352o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hdtH8RT352o/hqdefault.jpg?v=6562ebd6","content":{"View count":1491546}}

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! So, I found something... a few months ago, while we were trying to film a video where I let TikTok ads pick my outfits, I stumbled upon... this dress. It goes by a few names but it's most commonly some version of the \"floral midriff shaper corset sundress\" - and after buying one for the video, my for you page started getting flooded with TONS of ads for what looked like the same dress - but all from different companies, and with wildly different price points. So, I decided - let's buy a few of these bad boys and see what actually ends up at our doorstep - and find out, what the heck IS up. Where are all these dresses coming from? Are they all the same dress? Clearly someone is lying here - but who?

{"description":"She's probably the most powerful woman in North Korea: Kim Yo Jong, the dictator’s younger sister. She’s viewed as an emotionless and shrewd strategist for her brother, the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un. But just who is the \"Red Princess\"?\n\nKim Jong Un’s rise began in 2011 when their father, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il died at the age of 69. His death triggered emotional scenes including, at the funeral, that of a weeping woman who captured the attention of her country and the entire world: Kim Yo Jong.\n\nThis was Kim Yo Jong’s first official appearance alongside her brother Kim Jong Un, the new Supreme Leader of North Korea. Within a decade, Kim Yo Jong became the second highest ranking person in the Pyongyang regime and thereby her brother’s potential successor.\n\nKim Yo Jong holds a multifaceted political role: on the one hand, she knows where and when to deploy her charm -- such as on a visit to South Korea in 2018. But she also issues warnings against the \"imperialists” of Seoul and Washington. The documentary examines the personality and the career of the \"Red Princess”. It also takes a current look behind the scenes of this totalitarian regime. The nuclear power is mired in a crisis that originated at the outset of the Cold War.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

{"description":"There’s no greater comfort food than a hearty stew. And Irish Beef and Guinness Stew might be the king of them all! Guinness beer gives the sauce an incredible rich, deep flavour, and the beef is fall-apart tender. \nIrish Stew is one amazing stew. You already know that anything simmered for hours is bound to be delicious. But this... this is the stew you've always dreamed of. It's the one I make when I have guests over and want to truly impress them!\nThe key ingredient that gives Guinness Stew its rich flavor and deep color is Guinness Beer. And don't worry, the dish doesn't taste like beer at all! It transforms into a savory sauce that is absolutely mouthwatering. Plus, all the alcohol cooks out, so you won't be left with any boozy taste. Adding bacon to the stew is optional, but it definitely adds extra flavor. So go ahead and indulge if you'd like. Either way, you're in for a truly special stew. Try this delicious dish and comment how do you like it! Have a delicious day! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n2 tbsp Olive oil\n2lb / 900g beef \nSeason with salt and black pepper\n2 garlic cloves\n2 onions \n6 oz / 170g bacon\n2 carrots\n2 celery stalks\n3 tbsp flour \n14.9 oz  / 440ml Guinness Beer \n3 tbsp tomato paste\n3 cups / 750 ml broth \n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp thyme \n\n🤩 Knives I used in this video -  https://amzn.to/3QILFYm\nhttps://amzn.to/46fFUqy\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Start by cutting the beef into big chunks, approximatelly 4-5cm.\n2. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot (cast iron dutch oven) over high heat. Add the beef in batches and brown it well on all sides. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the beef. Once browned, transfer the beef onto a plate and repeat with the remaining batch of beef.\n3. Lower the heat to medium. Cook the garlic and onion for about 2 minutes until they start to soften. Then, add the bacon and continue cooking until the bacon is browned.\n4. Stir in the carrot and celery, and cook for a few more minutes.\n5. Add the flour to the pot and stir for 1 minute to cook off the flour.\n6. Pour in the Guinness, broth and tomato paste. Mix well to ensure the flour dissolves completely. Add the bay leaves and thyme.\n7. Return the beef and any accumulated juices back into the pot. The liquid level should just cover the ingredients.\n8. Cover the pot and lower the heat to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for 2 hours until the beef is tender. Then, remove the lid and simmer for an additional 45 minutes, or until the beef easily falls apart and the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.\nServe the beef and Guinness stew with pasta, mashed potatoes or whatever you like.
