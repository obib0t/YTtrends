{"description":"As was reported might be the case, it turns out that the first day after chemo is pretty OK, but then it gets progressively worse until day 5 or 6. I'm now on day 7 and feeling OK. I've had many (but not all!) of the expected side effects, but my appetite has been good, which is very good for the quality of life! Glad to be through the worst of the first treatment, but obviously I've still got a long way to go. I wouldn't want everyone to think that Day 7 is indicative of how you feel while you're doing chemo...if you had seen me on Day 3 I would have been 100% horizontal. \n\nI hear it tends to get a little worse every time (though I've got some tips for how to maybe make a few things hit a little less hard!) Really glad I was feeling good enough to make this video!

Hollywood paints it as a time of gunslingers, adventure, and cowboy heroes, but as often is the case, the reality is a bit more lackluster. While it was a rather violent place with high murder rates, this can be misleading as even one murder in a small population size can produce seemingly astronomical murder rates, essentially enhancing outliers in data. The truth is, the \"Wild West\" was a rather calm and boring time where people were much more focused on getting to the next day than robbing trains or saving damsels in distress. But while the dangers painted by Hollywood and dime novels are often over exaggerated and glamorized, that doesn't mean the region and time period was void of danger!

{"description":"Are YOU ready? THE FLASH - Only in Theaters June 16. #TheFlashMovie\n\nText 239-932-7332 to join the DC Community.\n https://my.community.com/dc\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe?\n\n“The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).\n\n“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023.","title":"THE FLASH - FINAL TRAILER","duration":141,"channel_id":"UCiifkYAs_bq1pt_zbNAzYGg","author":"DC","date":"20230524","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jprhe-cWKGs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jprhe-cWKGs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":11365775}}

{"description":"The in-depth story of the Lake Erie Skydiving Disaster 1967. \nTwenty skydivers eagerly board a World War Two Bomber plane for a complimentary high-altitude jump. Little do they know it would turn into the deadliest disaster in the history of recreational skydiving. As the plane ascends, they prepare for the exhilarating jump. But then, the weather worsens, and a thick layer of clouds engulfs the sky. Despite the golden rule of skydiving - \"don't jump if you can't see the target\" - the thrill-seekers leap into the abyss below, and sixteen fall to their deaths in the cold waters of Lake Erie in Ohio.\n\nSubscribe for more fascinating disaster documentaries: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb6yg8d7eoZF6vnL4e8mog?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTragic history playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtCh3_Fxp9FtVfTqXA06J3jhoxIFjpaF\n\nSuggest a topic for my next video: https://bit.ly/DarkRecordsTopics\n\nFootage used under fair-use.

As Tommy leaves New York after losing Ghost, LaKeisha and the only city he's ever known, he makes a quick detour to close an old wound that’s been haunting him for decades. What was supposed to be a quick stop turns into a labyrinth of family secrets and lies Tommy thought were long buried.  One step leads to another and Tommy quickly finds himself in Chicago's drug game, inserting himself between the city's two biggest crews. In a city divided by race, Tommy straddles the line, ultimately becoming the lynchpin that not only unites them - but holds the POWER to watch them crumble. As the first season unfolds at breakneck speed, Tommy uses his outsider status to his advantage, breaking all the local rules and rewriting them on his quest to become the biggest drug dealer in Chicago.","title":"Power Book IV: Force | Official Teaser | Season 2","duration":35,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230522","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knFMIPwzP0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_knFMIPwzP0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":517389}}
