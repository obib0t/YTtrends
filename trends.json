{"description":"Post Malone - Overdrive (Official Live Performance)\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast ‚Äì and it‚Äôs always been that way. Listen to ‚ÄúWhite Iverson‚Äù again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‚Äòbeerbongs & bentleys‚Äô and ‚ÄòTwelve Carat Toothache‚Äô and you‚Äôll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we‚Äôre waiting for ‚ÄòAustin,‚Äô Posty‚Äôs latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsome of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least ‚Äì trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.‚Äù To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he‚Äôs leveling up once again, no doubt. Check this performance of ‚ÄúOverdrive,‚Äù one of the 17 songs from the new album, and stay close as we roll out more performances soon.\n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.

{"description":"Experience Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Opening Look at his new film, Oppenheimer. The exclusive five-minute Opening Look, edited by the film‚Äôs editor Jennifer Lame, reveals new scenes, images and sounds from the IMAX¬Æ-shot epic thriller and features the film‚Äôs breathtaking score by Academy Award¬Æ winner Ludwig GoÃàransson. Oppenheimer, from Universal Pictures, arrives in theaters July 21, 2023.\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX¬Æ-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. \n \nThe film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù Oppenheimer. Oscar¬Æ winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar¬Æ winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar¬Æ nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment‚Äôs Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\nOppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX¬Æ 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX¬Æ black and white analogue photography. \n\nNolan‚Äôs films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations. \n\nSocial Handles:\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/oppenheimermovie    \nTW: https://www.twitter.com/@oppenheimerfilm  \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OppenheimerMovie \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/OppenheimerMovie/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/oppenheimermovie\nWebsite: https://www.OppenheimerMovie.com   \n#Oppenheimer","title":"Oppenheimer | Opening Look","duration":306,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230713","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOsIKu2VAkM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sOsIKu2VAkM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2027255}}

{"description":"Interview recorded on Monday, July 10th in Los Angeles, CA\n\n\"Barbie\" is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated movies of the year. At the end of last year, Finneas asked Billie Eilish to make a song for the movie after a conversation with Greta Gerwig and Mark Ronson. Now, the song, \"What Was I Made For?\" is ready to be released.\n\nBillie Eilish and Zane Lowe sit down in the theater to discuss the making of her song, \"What Was I Made For?\", which was created specifically for the blockbuster of the summer, but is also somehow incredibly personal. Billie opens up about her experience being involved in the movie, her feelings about songwriting for film and TV, and the childhood connection to Barbie that makes this a \"full circle\" moment.\n\nListen to Billie Eilish on Apple Music: https://apple.co/-BillieEilishYT\n\n00:00 - Billie Eilish on Her Involvement with Barbie\n9:34 - Inspiration Behind ‚ÄúWhat Was I Made For?‚Äù\n20:28 - Writer's Block\n27:35 - Billie Eilish on The Future\n\nSubscribe to Apple Music: https://apple.co/AppleMusicYT\n\nFollow Apple Music:\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@applemusic\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/applemusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/applemusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/applemusic\n\nWatch more Apple Music: \nWhat‚Äôs New: https://apple.co/2VFatTU\nApple Music Up Next: https://apple.co/2MLktXE\nInterviews: https://apple.co/32WnrPV\nWhat‚Äôs Trending: https://apple.co/2Meq89t\n\nApple Music lets you listen to millions of songs, online or off, totally ad-free.

A ferocious naturally-aspirated V12 sits up front-mid, creating 715 horsepower with a stunning 8250 rpm redline. It also has a unique active suspension system that Ferrari claims is a world first, and a trans-axle transmission layout to help achieve its target 49:51% weight distribution. But all that tech, power, and cabin room seems to weigh a lot. \n\nCan the engineering and chassis overcome the Purosangue‚Äôs size and weight to still provide a signature Ferrari experience? And how does Ferrari‚Äôs first foray into the world of super SUVs stack up against the competition? Thomas and James can‚Äôt wait to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

{"description":"The USMNT and Canada squared off in an ELECTRIC battle in the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup. During the first half, both teams' backline put in an amazing effort as not many chances went past both sides. Heading into the second half, much stayed the same until Brandon Vazquez's towering header gave the USMNT a 1-0 lead late in the game. It didn't take look for Canada to respond. Steven Vit√≥ria's clinical penalty finish forced the game to extra time. In the final stages of extra time, Jacob Shaffelburg gave Canada the brief lead, but a costly own goal forced the game to penalty kicks.

{"description":"How I Hunted the rarest armor on this minecraft server\n\nLike Sharkilz and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft SMP. Like Parrot / ParrotX2 Lifesteal SMP Series or Lomedy and his Infuse SMP Series, where he broke bedrock or blew up 12.240 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. I escaped this Minecraft prison like Omziiscool but not Parrot or Clownpierce or Spoke with 100+ / 2,193 Bedrock and TNT.  This stacked player stole my permanent hearts on the Lifesteal SMP.
