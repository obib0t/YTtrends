{"description":"This Halloween Season, some legends never die. Hocus Pocus 2, an Original movie event, streaming September 30 on Disney Plus.\n\nBette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy reunite for the highly anticipated Disney+ Original Movie “Hocus Pocus 2.” The live-action, long awaited sequel to the perennial Halloween classic, which brings back the delightfully wicked Sanderson sisters for more comedic mayhem, will debut on Disney+ on September 30.\n\nIt’s been 29 years since someone lit the Black Flame Candle and resurrected the 17th-century sisters, and they are looking for revenge. Now it is up to three high-school students to stop the ravenous witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on Salem before dawn on All Hallow’s Eve. “Hocus Pocus 2” also stars Doug Jones (“The Shape of Water”), Whitney Peak (“Gossip Girl”), Lilia Buckingham (“Dirt”), Belisa Escobedo (“American Horror Stories”), Hannah Waddingham (“Ted Lasso”), Tony Hale (“Veep”), Sam Richardson (“The Tomorrow War,” “Good Boys”), Juju Brener (“Vanquish”), Froy Gutierrez (“Teen Wolf”), Taylor Paige Henderson and Nina Kitchen. The film is directed by Anne Fletcher (“Dumplin,’” “The Proposal”), written by Jen D’Angelo (“Happy Together,” “Workaholics”) and produced by Lynn Harris (“King Richard,” “The Shallows”), with Adam Shankman (“Disenchanted,” “Hairspray”), Ralph Winter (“Hocus Pocus,” “X-Men” franchise) and David Kirschner (“Hocus Pocus,” “Chucky”) serving as executive producers.","title":"Teaser Trailer | Hocus Pocus 2 | Disney+","duration":81,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20220628","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecJRvz9nk-U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ecJRvz9nk-U/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1811111}}

Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism and so many people think our end is in sight. But humans always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on. \nThis is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants. What makes this worse is that we actually may live at an extremely critical moment in human history. To understand why, let us look at the temporal window of humanity and ask:\nWhen will the last human be born and how many people will there ever be? \n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3A5LwaB\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3OzdsIs\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible: ziipzaaapM16A4, Filippo, Alloy robot, Harold Mabin Jr, Toby Lowe, BiohazardVictim, Riad Salihu, Gunnstein Lye, Jeff Wheeldon, Andy Kelly, Quenby Joanette, Daniel Schulte-Hillen, Val Kabalkin, Maximilian Thomas Goldstein, Tyler Lindberg, Felix, Davesanify, Russ Newman, Kira, Thomas Schenck, Skyler Stanley, dirk from wellington, LoveGiants (Polyamorous) Seeking 4 BrotherHusbands, BalrogWing, Coffee is the path to victory, Addie, Lucas, vb, Santiago Perez, Robert Walsh, Angus Jake Smith, JamesDBartlett3, Marlison Gosalvez de Alencar, Rahul Golwalkar, Keerthi Vasan, Brian Bradley, Lincoln Volk, Haubrechts, Avalanche, Craig B, Tina Hatch, Nathan Ornat, Amathara, khalifa almehairbi, jtfletchbot, Steven Zeck, Maurice Ibler, Bafy78, Andreas Høve Smidt-Nielsen, Victoria Camp, Andrew Dawson, pierluigi valente, GH, Jay C, Sergey Melnik, CultistLemming, Thane Stevens, Alex MacKay, SimpleAvocado, Dave Kircher, Karen Rosenow, James Pita, Kyron","title":"The Last Human – A Glimpse Into The Far Future","duration":751,"channel_id":"UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q","author":"Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell","date":"20220628","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/LEENEFaVUzU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1968413}}

{"description":"PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/foolishbaseball\nTWEETER: https://twitter.com/FoolishBB\nMERCH: https://shop.jomboymedia.com/collections/foolish-baseball\n________________________________________\nThis one's about the best and worst umpires, at least with regards to calling the MLB strike zone. Umpire Angel Hernandez is probably the most infamous at the moment, but do you know Pat Hoberg? John Libka? Alan Porter? They're gonna be umpiring the strike zone for a lot longer than Angel Hernandez, Laz Diaz, or CB Bucknor.\n\nIn this episode of Baseball Bits, a Foolish Baseball production, there will be plenty of time to look at some MLB worst calls and MLB best calls, especially with regards to the MLB strike zone. But we'll also dig deeper on the subject of Robo-umps, the Automated Ball Strike System that may soon replace human strike zone callers. \n\nUmpScoreCards is a fairly new, public-facing way to grade umpires, and we'll be leaning on their work heavily to find the truth. Does MLB have an umpire problem? Kyle Schwarber seems to think so. But maybe it's the K-Zone that has us fooled. \n_______________________________________\nUmpScoreCards: https://www.umpscorecards.com/\nUmpScores: https://www.umpscores.com/\nHardball Times on QuesTec: https://tht.fangraphs.com/tht-live/does_questec_affect_the_strike_zone/\nBarry Bonds on QuestTec: https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-06-11-0306120051-story.html\n\nSoundtrack from Maxo: \nhttps://soundcloud.com/maxoelectronic\nhttps://maxoisnuts.bandcamp.com/","title":"What Bad Umpiring Looks Like | Baseball Bits","duration":1035,"channel_id":"UCbW12JIVAdi5NugdakbU33A","author":"Foolish Baseball","date":"20220627","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nX_ZphDNQM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_nX_ZphDNQM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":261270}}

{"description":"Hello friends & welcome to another video!! This week, I traveled to a Lost Luggage store with HopeScope to buy and try some lost luggage items...\n\nOver the past few years, we have tried a number of interesting ~secondhand purchasing experiences~, like buying an abandoned storage unit, buying a box of Amazon customer returns, and visiting an Amazon returns store - and something that I have been very interested in trying for quite a while now, is buying lost airline luggage. Because apparently if you lose a piece of luggage while traveling, and never come back for it, the airline will eventually sell it. And if you're in the US, chances are that they will sell it to the Unclaimed Baggage store in Scottsboro, AL - who sorts through and resells the items from that lost luggage. So we flew down there with our friend HopeScope to check out the store and buy a lost luggage haul of our own: a head-to-toe outfit each!! What did you guys think of our lost looks? Would you shop at this store?\n\nPS - Unclaimed Baggage does sell some of their inventory online here!\nhttps://www.unclaimedbaggage.com/\n\nCheck out HopeScope's channel & video here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAM2fyCjEdROyELretVTiiw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5aHcu19wio\n\nCheck out Unclaimed Baggage here! \nhttps://www.instagram.com/unclaimedbag/\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nLona Smith\nBryce Jennings\nDave Szamet\nNez Covington\nJarvis Rooker\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza","title":"I Went To A Lost Luggage Store","duration":1677,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20220626","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h31p4OLbqSc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/h31p4OLbqSc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2268031}}

In just one year since releasing his viral sensation “Never Comin’ Home,” the first song he’d ever written or performed, the rising singer/songwriter has already earned more than 100 million global streams to date and charted his latest release, “Fall In Love,” on the Billboard Hot 100. Born and raised in the small town of Louisville, IL, he grew up listening to hour after hour of country radio on long hauls across state lines with his father, who owned a trucking business. Back at home his mom instilled in him a life-long appreciation for the power chords and edgy vocals of 80’s hair rock. From long hours on the gas pipeline, to late nights of backbreaking roadwork, Zimmerman embodies the old school American values of hard work and dependability and applies the same steadfast mentality to his music. Through his plainspoken charm, contagious enthusiasm and genuine portrayal of life on the back roads, the up-and-comer has already attracted a loyal and passionate fan base. With more new music on the horizon, featuring the grit and gravel of his unmistakably Southern drawl, Zimmerman will continue to showcase the straightforward authenticity for which he is known and loved.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #FallInLove #RockAndAHardPlace","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Rock and A Hard Place (Official Music Video)","duration":227,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20220624","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyapQFCHUlg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyapQFCHUlg/hqdefault.jpg?v=62aa3836","content":{"View count":280748}}

He also asked if people were out looking for him.\n\nShe told him to wait for a call from his son, who was going to go out and find him, but Brown didn’t answer the phone after that, and nobody has been able to find him, even though hundreds of people out there helping with the search.\n\nBrown is 76 years old, about 5-foot-10, with white hair and blue eyes. He's also missing the tip of his index finger. \n\nHis car is a dark blue, 2014 Nissan Sentra with Oregon plates. \n\nThere had been a few sightings reported, but none were substantiated, said Daryle Brown, Ralph Brown’s son.\n\nDaryle said his parents were in their home on May 16 when Brown stood up and said he was going to his “other house.” \n\nRalph has early-onset Alzheimer’s symptoms, which leads to confusion. He no longer has a driver’s license and has not driven a car in more than a year, Daryle said.\n\nHe drove away from the home in the 600 block of South 12th Avenue in Cornelius, Oregon. \n\nThere had been no location pings on his phone after 10:25pm that evening, and no communication from Brown in the time since he’s been missing. \n\nThis video/documentary shares with you the final search for Ralph and what it took to bring him home. \n\n❤️..
