We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #travel #travelvlog #alcatraz \n\n0:00 Our biggest fear\n0:50 Why are we doing this?!\n3:41 Seeing Alcatraz for the first time\n4:19 INSIDE Alcatraz (prison tour)\n5:50 What we are wearing to swim\n7:29 BEST VPN\n8:35 MORNING OF THE SWIM\n12:42 JUMPING IN the San Francisco Bay\n19:19 Our final thoughts on the swim","title":"WE ATTEMPTED THE DEADLY SWIM (Alcatraz to San Francisco)","duration":1410,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220528","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6H4dLs9kGU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M6H4dLs9kGU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":643295}}

I'm 27 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here.

{"description":"The beginning of the episode started with a recap of the prequels, ending with yoda’s line to him at the end of revenge of the sith where he tells Obi-Wan he has training for him, to teach him to commune with his old master qui-gon. So I think for sure we’ll see or hear Qui-Gon Jinn’s force ghost once again.\n\nWe start on coruscant, at the jedi temple where the younglings are being trained by a jedi master, as two 501st clones rush in to execute order 66. As she does her best to protect the younglings, she gets defeated and we see one of the younglings centred. I believe this could be a young Reva. She was a Jedi as the grand inquisitor states. We hear palpatine continuously say execute order 66 as see them running away while the temple is under attack as we saw in revenge of the sith.\n\nTransitioning to Tatooine, we see the Inquisitors land down and interrogate a cantina for the location of a Jedi hiding there. Reva uses tactics to snuff him out \nthat are very heaty in the eyes of the Grand Inquisitor, we have to remember that the senate is still a thing at this time, and isn’t disbanded quite yet. So Palpatine still doesn’t has as much free reign as he does in the original trilogy with blowing up alderaan and doing whatever he pleases whenever. The Jedi gets away and the Grand Inquisitor tells Reva he’s had enough of her wreckless behaviour and her fixation on Kenobi, that he’s not hers to find. He’s Vader’s, are my thoughts. I think she hates Kenobi so much for failing Anakin, but I could be wrong. \nWe finally meet up with Kenobi cutting sushi in the middle of the desert, making a living for himself as a regular man. Getting back to his Eopie, which could be the same one from revenge of the sith, he feeds it and heads back home. Heading to his cave, makes himself at home when he’s visited by a Jawa named TEEKA who hands Kenobi a toy ship, a lambda t4a imperial shuttle for Luke. \nWhen Teeka shows him a belt of the Jedi we just saw, telling Obi-Wan that a Jedi ran through the dune sea inquisitors after him and all and Obi-Wan says the Jedi are all extinct, now he knows that a jedi is here and the inquisitors are aware. This makes his job more difficult to protect Luke. He has to be on a higher alert now and keep watch of the boy more than usual.\n\nAs he goes to sleep, he has ptsd of Anakin and what happened to him. This is 10 years after the events of revenge of the sith, which means his ptsd was probably even worse in the years prior. He tries to reach out to qui-gon, and this isn’t the first time. The beginning of the episode started with a recap of the prequels, ending with yoda’s line to him at the end of revenge of the sith where he tells Obi-Wan he has training for him, to teach him to commune with his old master qui-gon. So to me, I think obi-wan hasn’t spoken to qui-gon yet. He;s trying, but he isn’t connecting himself to the force, he can’t. If he does, the empire will detect him. and Sniff him out like a dog to food.\n\nObi-Wan watches over Luke as he runs from Owen, much like Anakin, playful and rebellious.\n\nThrough the desert, Obi-Wan is found by Navi, the Jedi the inquisitors were after. He has a short interaction with Obi-Wan who pretends he’s not the famous Jedi Master. He finally breaks and tells the boy to forget the Jedi and let it go. To bury his lightsaber in the sand. Kenobi is a broken man. He’s hurting and he’s no longer the same hopeful man he used to be. I believe the point is to show a broken obi-wan turning into the hopeful alec guiness obi-wan we see later.\n\nOn Alderaan we meet with Leia. This is the best casting of a young Leia I’ve ever seen. I think she played the role so well. She portrays Leia’s rebellious, know it all personality while being adorable at the same time. Playing tricks on her mother and running off into the forest to explore.\n\nObi-Wan’s mundane life repeats itself and it seems like it’s really taken the wind from his sails. Heading back to his Eopie, Uncle Owen throws the toy he left for Luke onto the ground and tells Kenobi to leave them alone. Owen doesn’t like Obi-Wan for many reasons. One being that he blames Kenobi for the fall of Anakin and turn into Darth Vader, and the overall state of the galaxy. He also doesn’t like how Obi-Wan is always watching over Luke, he thinks it’ll eventually tip someone off and it’ll get them hurt all because of obi-wan snooping around and keeping watch.\n\nObi-Wan asks if Luke is ok, and owen says you don’t care if he’s ok you care if he’s showing. He means showing signs of the force. Meaning Owen thinks Kenobi only uses Luke to push him to be a Jedi like Anakin, and that didn’t turn out well.\n\nContinued in video...\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join\n\nContinue the conversation on the Theory forums!\nhttps://starwarstheory.com/THEORY/posts\n\nBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory","title":"Obi-Wan Kenobi Episode 1 BREAKDOWN","duration":857,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20220527","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScLHffxXkkE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ScLHffxXkkE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":660972}}

{"description":"Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 - NEW TRAILER 2022 | NetPro's Concept Version\n\nThis trailer is a concept-mashup that shows my idea of ​​how the teaser trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 might look like.       \n____________________________________________\n◖Made/Edited By NetPro ◗\n▻ netfl.pro192@gmail.com\n____________________________________________\n\n◅ On our channel we create а trailer mashups ▻\nalso known as recut trailers, involve collecting multiple pieces of film footage from one or multiple movies and editing them to create a new trailer. Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.\n\nThere is no intention of infringing on anyone's intellectual property. This is not intended to deceive or defraud anyone; rather, it is intended to give fans a taste of what the film may be like. I don't own the material; I simply produce trailers for fans and others who are excited about a movie.\n\nThe trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.\n____________________________________________\n\nAbout Poppy Playtime:\n\nA survival horror video game with puzzle elements, developed and published by indie developer MOB Games. It was released on Steam for Windows on October 12, 2021. The game tells the story of a former employee who visits an abandoned factory of children's toys, formerly owned by the gaming company Playtime Co., 10 years after its employees disappeared without a trace.","title":"Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 - NEW TRAILER 2022 | NetPro's Concept Version","duration":59,"channel_id":"UCgLKyuJH2kaZX5sIJLKZ_aQ","author":"NetPro","date":"20220528","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7PsjG_cUFs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l7PsjG_cUFs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2781682}}

From Wandavision, to Hawkeye, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, they’re really pumping things out. The latest show on the slate was Moon Knight, starring Oscar Isaac as several versions of Oscar Isaac!\n\nMoon Knight definitely raises a few questions. Like how much do we actually see Moon Knight in the Moon Knight how? How was it so easy for Harrow to convince the gods that he’s innocent? Why didn’t they just use an iPhone map to check the star map? When is death actually fatal in the MCU? Who knew it was that easy to escape from the afterlife?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Moon Knight!

{"description":"Beast - Only In Theaters August 19\n\nSometimes the rustle in the bushes actually is a monster.\n\nIdris Elba (Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, The Suicide Squad) stars in a pulse-pounding new thriller about a father and his two teenage daughters who find themselves hunted by a massive rogue lion intent on proving that the savannah has but one apex predator.  \n\nElba plays Dr. Nate Daniels, a recently widowed husband who returns to South Africa, where he first met his wife, on a long-planned trip with their daughters to a game reserve managed by Martin Battles (Sharlto Copley, Russian Doll series, Maleficent), an old family friend and wildlife biologist. But what begins as a journey of healing jolts into a fearsome fight for survival when a lion, a survivor of blood-thirsty poachers who now sees all humans as the enemy, begins stalking them. \n\nIyana Halley (The Hate U Give, This is Us series) plays Daniels’ 18-year-old daughter, Meredith, and Leah Sava Jeffries (Rel series, Empire series) plays his 13-year-old, Norah.  \n\nFrom visceral, experiential filmmaker Baltasar Kormákur, the director of Everest and Universal Pictures’ 2 Guns and Contraband, Beast is produced by Will Packer, the blockbuster producer of Girls Trip, the Ride Along franchise, and ten movies that have opened No. 1 at the U.S. box office, including Night School, No Good Deed and Think Like a Man, by James Lopez, president of Will Packer Productions, and by Baltasar Kormákur. The film is written by Ryan Engle (Rampage, Non-Stop) from an original story by Jaime Primak Sullivan and is executive produced by Jaime Primak Sullivan and Bernard Bellew.\n\nSocial Handles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/beastmovie_official/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/beastmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BeastMovie/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics \nWebsite: https://www.beastmovie.com \n#BeastMovie","title":"Beast | Official Trailer","duration":151,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20220525","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQMc7Sq36mI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oQMc7Sq36mI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":7679895}}

{"description":"“I’m gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight.” Don’t miss Austin Butler and Tom Hanks in THE film of the summer. See Baz Luhrmann’s #ElvisMovie only in theaters June 24. ⚡️ #TCB \n\nhttps://elvis.warnerbros.com \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ElvisMovie \nhttps://www.instagram.com/ElvisMovie \nhttps://twitter.com/ElvisMovie \n\nELVIS is an epic, big-screen spectacle from Warner Bros. Pictures and visionary, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Baz Luhrmann that explores the life and music of Elvis Presley, starring Austin Butler and Oscar winner Tom Hanks. \n\nA thoroughly cinematic drama, Elvis’s (Butler) story is seen through the prism of his complicated relationship with his enigmatic manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Hanks). As told by Parker, the film delves into the complex dynamic between the two spanning over 20 years, from Presley’s rise to fame to his unprecedented stardom, against the backdrop of the evolving cultural landscape and loss of innocence in America. Central to that journey is one of the significant and influential people in Elvis’s life, Priscilla Presley (Olivia DeJonge). \n\nStarring alongside Butler and Hanks, award-winning theatre actress Helen Thomson (“Top of the Lake: China Girl,” “Rake”) plays Elvis’s mother, Gladys, Richard Roxburgh (“Moulin Rouge!” “Breath,” “Hacksaw Ridge”) portrays Elvis’s father, Vernon, and DeJonge (“The Visit,” “Stray Dolls”) plays Priscilla. Luke Bracey (“Hacksaw Ridge,” “Point Break”) plays Jerry Schilling, Natasha Bassett (“Hail, Caesar!”) plays Dixie Locke, David Wenham (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Lion,” “300”) plays Hank Snow, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (“The Trial of the Chicago 7,” “The High Note”) plays B.B. King, Xavier Samuel (“Adore,” “Love & Friendship,” “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse”) plays Scotty Moore, and Kodi Smit-McPhee (“The Power of the Dog”) plays Jimmie Rodgers Snow. \n\nAlso in the cast, Dacre Montgomery (“Stranger Things,” “The Broken Heart Gallery”) plays TV director Steve Binder, alongside Australian actors Leon Ford (“Gallipoli,” “The Pacific”) as Tom Diskin, Kate Mulvany (“The Great Gatsby,” “Hunters”) as Marion Keisker, Gareth Davies (“Peter Rabbit,” “Hunters”) as Bones Howe, Charles Grounds (“Crazy Rich Asians,” “Camp”) as Billy Smith, Josh McConville (“Fantasy Island”) as Sam Phillips, and Adam Dunn (“Home and Away”) as Bill Black. \n\nTo play additional iconic musical artists in the film, Luhrmann cast singer/songwriter Yola as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, model Alton Mason as Little Richard, Austin, Texas native Gary Clark Jr. as Arthur Crudup, and artist Shonka Dukureh as Willie Mae “Big Mama” Thornton. \n\nOscar nominee Luhrmann (“The Great Gatsby,” “Moulin Rouge!”) directed from a screenplay by Baz Luhrmann & Sam Bromell and Baz Luhrmann & Craig Pearce and Jeremy Doner, story by Baz Luhrmann and Jeremy Doner. The film’s producers are Luhrmann, Oscar winner Catherine Martin (“The Great Gatsby,” “Moulin Rouge!”), Gail Berman, Patrick McCormick and Schuyler Weiss. Toby Emmerich, Courtenay Valenti and Kevin McCormick executive produced. \n\nThe director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Mandy Walker (“Mulan,” “Australia”), Oscar-winning production designer and costume designer Catherine Martin (“The Great Gatsby,” “Moulin Rouge!”), production designer Karen Murphy (“A Star Is Born”), editors Matt Villa (“The Great Gatsby,” “Australia”) and Jonathan Redmond (“The Great Gatsby”), Oscar-nominated visual effects supervisor Thomas Wood (“Mad Max: Fury Road”), music supervisor Anton Monsted (“Australia,” “Moulin Rouge!”) and composer Elliott Wheeler (“The Get Down”). \n\nPrincipal photography on “Elvis” took place in Queensland, Australia with the support of the Queensland Government, Screen Queensland, and the Australian Government’s Producer Offset program. \n\nA Warner Bros. Pictures Presentation, A Bazmark Production, A Jackal Group Production, A Baz Luhrmann Film, “Elvis” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is set to release in theaters in North America on June 24, 2022, and internationally beginning 22 June 2022.","title":"Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS | Official Trailer 2","duration":191,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

{"description":"What if funk/fusion drummer Dennis Chambers was the drummer for Tool? \n\n(Don’t tell Danny Carey.)\n\nDennis is known for his legendary backbeat and funky style. So of course we felt mischievous and we dared him to try playing “Schism”, one of Tool’s biggest songs. It’s full of odd time signatures, quick, complex changes and unexpected accents, and Dennis had never heard it before.\n\nBut we didn’t ask him to learn the real drum parts: we wanted to see what he’d come up with on his own after hearing the song once. While you’ll hear the song with drums in this video, Dennis was actually listening to a drumless track.\n\n“This is not me,” he warned us as he listened through the track, but “in my younger days, this would’ve been up my alley!”\n\nHow will Dennis Chambers not only learn a song he’s never heard before, but in a style he’s unfamiliar with – and in odd time, at that?\n\nSince the song doesn’t have a drum track, he listens for two things: the style and the time signature. Watch Dennis’ playthrough where he gives it his own spin. It’s solid, it’s groovy, and there’s some unexpected footwork later on. It’s amazing how much a song can change with a different approach on the drums.\n\nYou’ve never heard Schism played like this before!\n\nIf you like Dennis Chambers, he has an entire 12-lesson course on funk drumming for Drumeo members.
