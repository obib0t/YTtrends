But his spirit lives on in you. Thanks to the strength of the fan community, I'm able to bring you this. Hopefully it will start showing up as his most recent video instead of \"so long nerds\" because frankly that thing is a downer.\n\nPlease keep spreading the love and keeping his spirit alive.

{"description":"The 2022 Ford GT (US $660,845 when purchased) is so much more than a pretty face designed in a wind tunnel. It has a twin turbo V6 with 660 horsepower, lots of weight saving carbon fibre, and a rapidly-deploying suspension drop system along with an active rear wing that is as functional as it is dramatic. But how does it stack up against a 2023 Corvette C8 Z06 ($164,505 as specced in the US, $189,027 in Canada) which is but a fraction of the cost and has a high-revving naturally aspirated V8? Thomas and James put these two marvels of American engineering to the test. We hope you enjoy the episode! Thanks for watching.

Every $1 counts so thank you for clicking the donate button on this screen to help Make-A-Wish Foundation grant the wishes of these kids.\n\nI just had one of the eight spinal tumors removed from my back, so I can't do a whole lot while I recover from surgery. But, with the help of my wife, Vy Qwaint, I think we can build a pretty awesome indoor family entertainment center for everybody to enjoy. Inside the adventure park we plan on having a trampoline park, video game arcade, zip line, ropes course, ninja warrior training courses, escape rooms, axe throwing, free roam Virtual Reality VR, retro barcade, climbing walls, restaurant, birthday party rooms, and a ton more fun stuff to do here in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nWe're gonna need a lot more help to get this FEC built by my birthday on March 10th so we need to hire some help. Vy interviews Burt and attempts to interview a guy name James but it doesn't go so well. The last candidate, Anne, we brought over to interview from bed.

You can tell he worked on the video because the animation was good lol. I'm working on building a team to be able to make more videos and Matt has been a huge help in that effort. I'm still learning how to build a team at all so there may be some growing pains but it's exciting that it's happening.\n\nAnyway this video is about an experience I had last summer. My friend invited me to go farm sit and that was a great and rare opportunity just plopped on my lap so I decided I really wanted to go. And so I did! There was a lot of new experiences gained from the trip, and in this video was the most notable ones. Italy is a beautiful place with really tasty food. I am certainly going back some day. Either as a farmer or a tourist who knows.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this video.

France made a surprising call after subbing out Olivier Giroud and Ousman Dembele in 40‚Äô. Mbapp√© would put the team on his back in the second half. He would score on a PK in 79‚Äô and would score right after in 81‚Äô. The match would head to extra time. Lionel Messi would add another goal in 108‚Äô. Kylian Mbapp√© would add the equalizer in 118‚Äô via PK.

{"description":"I‚Äôve just disembarked what may be the shortest and weirdest cruise in history on a ship that was planned to be scrapped in 2020. She was saved from the scrapyard by a new British cruise line and I booked a 3 night mini break onboard the ship. \n \nOur cruise was cancelled 4 hours after we boarded and in total we were onboard this ship for about 8 hours, and during that time we had more problems than we would usually on a full two week cruise. The way that everything was handled was so bizarre I honestly think I‚Äôm still in shock. \n \nWe boarded the ship in London Tilbury and were planning on heading to Bruges to the Christmas markets. Embarkation was pretty easy and despite the bad weather we were really excited to get onboard. \n \nI picked up my cruise card which is the thing you use to get into your room, to buy drinks, pretty much everything onboard it‚Äôs very important. But my friends Justin and Tristan were told that they‚Äôd have to get theirs onboard as they weren‚Äôt ready yet, no big deal we thought, that isn‚Äôt uncommon on a cruise for things to be a bit delayed. The problem was much bigger than that but at this point we didn‚Äôt realise how widespread the problem was. \n \nAs soon as we embarked the ship we were in the middle of this beautiful Atrum, the ship was decorated for Christmas and looked amazing. Despite the ship being from 1991 everything here looked very new and I hoped that the rest of the ship would be as nice as this area. I didn‚Äôt have particularly high expectations after reading review after review online about broken toilets, broken air conditioning but this area definitely surpassed what I had expected. \n\nCruise Buoys Vlog: https://youtu.be/k8gPqPTbFgw\nSail Away With Dan and Jay Tour: https://youtu.be/XBCVVW75SGk\n \nOne of my favourite things about cruising is that feeling when you first get onboard a cruise ship and you run around exploring as fast as you can. Looking back I‚Äôm so glad that I did because I wouldn‚Äôt have a chance to later. We found a big pub area called The Purple Turtle which I‚Äôve since found out used to be a casino. In the UK we don‚Äôt gamble as much as other places so if a British cruise line buys an American or Australian ship, they normally replace the big casino with one thats much smaller. \n \nThe ship was originally launched in 1991 for Princess cruises as Regal Princess and spent most of her life as Pacific Dawn for P&O Australia. As I was wandering around the main public areas I thought wow Ambassador have done a great job renovating these spaces, I‚Äôve since had a look at P&O Dawn ship reviews and I think I should be giving a lot of the credit to P&O instead of Ambassador because most of the inside spaces haven‚Äôt changed, even the picture frames are the same in the big lounges. Not that that‚Äôs a bad thing, they didn‚Äôt need to be changed, P&O did a great job with these areas when they refit the ship back in 2017. \n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to exclusive perks like a weekly podcast and early ad free access to videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu4C8c3h9SKdkxnOwIAiHeA/join\n\n‚ñ∂ Weekly Updates: http://EmmaCruises.com/News\n‚ñ∂ Book a Cruise: https://EmmaCruises.com/Book-a-Cruise/\n\nLet‚Äôs Connect! \n‚ñ∂ https://EmmaCruises.com/SocialLinks\n\n*** \n‚ñ∂  Background World Map: https://emmacruises.com/map (Affiliate link)\n\nemma@emmacruises.com","title":"Our Cruise Was CANCELLED After 4 Hours Onboard","duration":779,"channel_id":"UCu4C8c3h9SKdkxnOwIAiHeA","author":"Emma Cruises","date":"20221220","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jppzHpO_8xU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jppzHpO_8xU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1044386}}

{"description":"Sponsor: Fractal Pop Air RGB Case on Amazon https://geni.us/TMxbP\nThe NVIDIA RTX 4080 has a problem: No one is buying it -- or at least, not enough people that board partners are feeling relief from their investment. They're on the hook for millions upon millions of dollars in inventory, and it's because NVIDIA's pricing structure is so egregiously bad that sales have finally slowed. NVIDIA got comfortable with a market where literally anything would sell, no exaggeration, and just existing would guarantee a sale. But that market is over, and now NVIDIA has an RTX 4080 problem. The other issue is that MSRP cards don't exist -- partners launched some, then stopped stocking them.\n\nWatch our tour of EVGA's GPU lab as it nears end of life: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr3lsU718Lg\nGrab a GN 3D 'Debug' Coaster pack!

{"description":"Oppenheimer - Only In Theaters 7 21 23\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX¬Æ-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. \n \nThe film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù Oppenheimer. Oscar¬Æ winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar¬Æ winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar¬Æ nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J.

{"description":"A major winter storm is expected to develop in the days leading up to Christmas. Behind the storm a massive chunk of Arctic air will plunge into the lower 48 giving some the coldest air they have felt in years. Travel could be significantly impacted for the holiday.\n\nThe highest impacts when it comes to the snow will be in the Great Lakes Region and Midwest.\n\nSome places, especially along and around the Great Lakes could pick up more than a foot. Areas in parts of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin could see near-blizzard conditions as the storm gets stronger Thursday night into Friday.\n\nThings quiet down for Christmas Eve, but the chill settles in all the way down to Florida. Miami could fall into the 30s and Orlando could dip below freezing.\n\nThe only place to escape the Arctic chill is the Desert Southwest and Southern California. Or The Caribbean :)\n\nSubscribe to @News6WKMG for more updates!","title":"UPDATE!

{"description":"Argentines celebrate on Sunday that their hero Lionel Messi‚Äôs once-in-a-generation career is complete. The Argentina superstar is finally a World Cup champion.\n\nMessi scored two goals and then another in a shootout as Argentina beat France 4-2 on penalties Sunday to claim a third World Cup title despite Kylian Mbapp√© scoring the first hat trick in a final in 56 years.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, fans cheered, cried, hugged and waved the Argentina flag as they gathered to watch the match.\n\nMessi is definitively in the pantheon of soccer‚Äôs greatest ever players, alongside Pel√© ‚Äî a record three-time World Cup champion from Brazil ‚Äî and Diego Maradona, the late Argentina great with whom Messi was so often compared.\n\nMessi has achieved what Maradona did in 1986, dominate a World Cup for Argentina.\n\nMessi put Argentina ahead from the penalty spot and played a part in Angel Di Maria‚Äôs goal that made it 2-0 after 36 minutes.\n\nMbapp√© scored two goals in a 97-second span to take the game to extra time, and then Messi tapped in his second goal in the 109th minute. But there was still time for another penalty from Mbapp√© to take the thrilling game to a shootout.\n\nPlease subscribe, like the video and share wherever you can!\n\nHelp support the channel from only ¬£0.99p a month!!\nGet special loyalty badges next to your name in the comments and live chat!

{"description":"Today, I'm getting back surgery to remove a large tumor near my tailbone. It'll be a difficult procedure as the tumor is inside the spinal column and is surrounded by many nerves. Surgeons will have to make it through multiple bones to get in there and remove as much of it as possible. We then have to wait for biopsy results to figure out how to handle all the remaining tumors (I have a total of eight in my spine). It is looking most like I'll be needing radiation therapy as well as chemotherapy. \n\nThey believe what I have is something called Myxopapillary Ependymoma (MEPN). From what I'm researching online, it seems about one in a million people get this. It seems to be growing from the central nervous system out of the spinal cord rather than the brain, in my case. \n\nOver the last 18 months or longer, I've been experiencing an incredible amount of pain in my tailbone, hamstrings, calve muscles, lower back, and gluteus muscles. It is particularly painful when trying to do physical activity such as jumping, running, jogging, and even walking. It feels like a knife is being stabbed up into my tailbone area. So, it's been pretty painful filming my YouTube videos for a while now. This is why I haven't been doing as many martial arts and other fun and crazy physical challenges lately. Hopefully, after this surgery I'll be able to get back to normal life and doing all the fun things I used to do.\n\nThanks to all of you who have been super supportive and positive throughout this. I really appreciate it. Also, thank you to everybody at Keck Medicine at USC in Los Angeles, CA. Every single person I spent time with, surgeons, nurses, physical therapists, doctors, MRI technicians, etc... everybody was super positive and just had a really good attitude despite having a very difficult job. \n\n\n‚ñ∂ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n‚ñ∂ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n‚ñ∂ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n‚ñ∂ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.
