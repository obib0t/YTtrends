{"description":"Explosions have reportedly hit a Russian airbase far from the Ukrainian border, damaging two long-range bombers. Unverified videos of the blasts have been posted on a variety of Telegram channels. \nThe blasts early Monday struck the airbase near the city of Engels, more than 600 kilometers inside Russian territory. The bombers damaged are said to be of the same type used to carry out airstrikes on Ukraine's infrastructure. Another explosion hit a military base near the Russian city of Ryazan. At least three people were reportedly killed after a fuel tank exploded. So far there has been no claim of responsibility for either of the blasts.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n#Russia #Ukraine #UkraineWar","title":"Explosions hit military bases deep within Russian territory | DW News","duration":285,"channel_id":"UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg","author":"DW News","date":"20221205","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFug2Wf3DcU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/UFug2Wf3DcU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1267264}}

{"description":"England and Senegal faced off in the knockout stage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The first half was completely dominated by England as Jordan Henderson scored in the 38th minute and Harry Kane scored his first goal of the World Cup in stoppage time of the first half.

{"description":"DOWNLOAD SPARK: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\nCheck out My Video on SPARK: https://youtu.be/Abuks6DmsjA\n\nWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n\n_________FAQs__________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

{"description":"Stephen Thompson | December 2, 2022\n\nNow that we‚Äôre back to recording Tiny Desk concerts in the office, home concerts mostly happen under special circumstances: when the artist is overseas, for example, or otherwise unable to get to Washington, D.C., when we‚Äôre recording. Given that BTS‚Äôs RM (aka Kim Nam-joon) is based in South Korea, we let it slide ‚Äî not least because his team put together one of the most impressive Tiny Desk facsimiles we‚Äôve seen yet. What really sets it apart is the huge array of shelf-bound ephemera, which is bound to have the BTS Army sleuthing in the YouTube comments. What‚Äôs a random tchotchke and what‚Äôs an Easter egg? Study the set closely!\n\nRM timed his solo Tiny Desk debut ‚Äî which follows BTS‚Äôs home concert from back in 2020 ‚Äî to coincide with the release of his first official studio album, Indigo. But he kicks off the set with an older track, ‚Äúseoul,‚Äù which first appeared on his 2018 mixtape mono. From there, he showcases the first two tracks from Indigo: the rap-driven ‚ÄúYun‚Äù and the funky ‚ÄúStill Life,‚Äù both of which are inspired by RM‚Äôs love of and fascination with painting. The studio tracks feature Erykah Badu and Anderson .Paak, respectively, both of whom get shoutouts in this set. But here, the focus never drifts away from the star at center stage ‚Äî no matter how closely you might squint at the stuffed animals, housewares, clocks and toys (not to mention Big Mouth Billy Bass!) behind him.\n\nNow, if we can just get him to visit the real Tiny Desk‚Ä¶\n\n\nSET LIST\n‚Äúseoul‚Äù\n‚ÄúYun‚Äù\n‚ÄúStill Life‚Äù\n\nMUSICIANS\nRM: vocals\nDOCSKIM: keyboard \njohn eun: guitar\nJaeshin Park: bass\nJK Kim: drums\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Oui Kim (OUI)\nProducer: Yeonjin Kim (OUI)\nAUDIO:\nJEONG WOO YEONG\nSon Yu Jeong\n\nCREW:\nHuiwon Song\nSunyoung Kim\nHyeri Shin \nEumKo\nYoungwoo Lee\nEunil Lee\nSungju Min \nKihun Kim \nSeungjong Lee\nYuntae Ko \nKidung Kim\nKiyong Eom\nDonghyun Lee\nDoosoo Choi\nYujin Jung\nSangjoon Lee \nKieun Lee \nKihyun Lee \nSeonghyeon Heo\nInsol Yun\nHyeongeun Kim \nYujin Ko \nDaeun Han\nJae Yoo \nGANi \nLeehyun Kim \nYeonhwa Cha\nDaye Shin\nDaniella Kim\nSaeyong Oh\nLee Jung Min\nLee Hyeon Ki\nJeong Dae Seong\nJinho Jeong\nRachel Um\nJennie Lee\nRosa Kim\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Suraya Mohamed, Bobby Carter, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Ashley Pointer, Jill Britton, Sofia Seidel\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #rm #bts #nprmusic","title":"RM of BTS: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert","duration":1084,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20221202","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKg3FV5gwMc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CKg3FV5gwMc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2253950}}

A pottery wheel is a small table on which pottery is formed that is able to be rotated about an axis to form more symmetrical pots. In this case it is a slow pottery wheel meaning that it is turned by hand rather than being turned at high speed by foot power or other means. A wooden frame was made to hold the axle for the wheel and a cane strip was used to hold the axle on to the frame while allowing it to turn. Then a clay table top was made to fit on top of the axle. A stone bearing block held the lower end of the axle. A clay pot was then formed onto it whilst turning the table to better access all points of the pot. The pot was then fired and tested. The slow wheel is good for forming pots but is hard to set up. It also turns too slow for pot throwing (spinning the pot at speed and forming with the hands by drawing the clay up). Future iterations might be a kick wheel with a fly wheel for momentum or some other means of powering the while leaving the hands free to form the pot.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #pottery #potterywheel","title":"Primitive Technology: Pottery Wheel","duration":561,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20221201","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqhxe_pL6Ws","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Gqhxe_pL6Ws/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1114471}}

Now this is picking up in the aftermath of the Holiday Special. Incase you didn't check it out there were a couple of things that were dropped in it to set up the upcoming film. James Gunn even said the Holiday special was helpful because he didn't have to spend time explaining why the Guardians had Knowhere and so on.\n\nSo the main pointers we learned from it are that they indeed own Knowhere now after buying it off the Collector. Though it was destroyed during the events of Avengers Infinity War they have fixed it up. We don't knwo what's happened with The Collector but his ship was spotted at the start of the Loki finale with him flying past the camera as we travelled out of the universe.\n\nOther revelations are that Peter and Mantis are brother and sister due to Ego being their father. This was teased all the way back in 2017 when a deleted scene of Mantis' mother was posted by the actor. In the group shot photo we could also see her at the back whilst Ego talked about all the children he had.\n\nFinally Cosmo the space dog was introduced who we'll talk more about in just a bit.\n\nNow if you enjoy the video then please hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe for breakdowns like this every day. With that out the way thanks for clicking this, now let's get into the Guardians trailer.\n\n-\n\nNow the trailer opens with the Marvel studios logo which then transforms into the cover of the Awesome Mix Tape.\n\nGunn has stated that we will be getting a third volume and after hearing how niche his song choice was for the holiday special I can't wait to see what he has here.\n\nThe Hall H trailer had the song Do You Realize by the Flaming Lips which was pretty fitting for what was shown there. That focused more heavily on Peter and Gamora realising that they weren't on the same page and her basically doing a it's not you...it's me.\n\nLike literally.","title":"GUARDIANS Of The Galaxy Volume 3 Trailer Breakdown | Easter Eggs, Hidden Details, Reaction & Rocket","duration":904,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20221201","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iPe8ndtXEY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5iPe8ndtXEY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":223227}}

{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed to Malibu by _Grey‚Äôs Anatomy_ star Ellen Pompeo for a tour of her inviting mid-century beach house. Pompeo first went to scope out the property several years earlier, when the house was originally up for sale and _Grey‚Äôs_ was still in its infancy. ‚ÄúI knew I couldn‚Äôt afford it, but I didn‚Äôt tell anyone that,‚Äù she confesses. When the house came back on the market in 2013, she seized the second chance. As her fans know, Pompeo is a bona fide interior-design enthusiast whose past renovations include a modern barn in¬†Sag Harbor and her main residence, a 1920s Mediterranean-style villa in Los Angeles. The addition of her Malibu home has only added fuel to the fire. ‚ÄúI am entering a very exciting phase of my life, if I do say so myself.‚Äù\r\n\r\n*Kitchen*\r\n(Similar) Flint Grey Marble Bowl https://fave.co/3EIH6Hk\r\n(Similar) Etsy Set of 3 Bread Boards https://fave.co/3FmGEAh\r\n(Similar) Serene Spaces Apothecary Jars¬†https://amzn.to/3ENJ7SD\r\n(Similar) Modern Petal Backless Leather Counter Stool https://fave.co/3EPwBBY\r\n(Similar) Diem Tumbler (Set of 4) https://fave.co/3GWyTlr\r\n(Similar) Crisp Matte Black Dinner Plate https://fave.co/3FcQ2pN\r\nCB2 Trap Pitcher https://fave.co/3VDUJP2\r\n\r\n*Kids Bedroom*\r\n(Similar) Purple Moroccan Rug https://fave.co/3FdB17l\r\n(Similar) Geometric Grasscloth Wallpaper https://fave.co/3FdB4A3\r\n(Similar) Lovesac Bean Bag https://fave.co/3VzxPYW\r\nBackgammon by Suzi Kondi https://fave.co/3icmI9R\r\n\r\n*Bedroom*\r\n(Similar) Ace Canopy Bed https://fave.co/3ilS4Ll\r\n(Similar) Borrego Small Round Ottoman https://fave.co/3ELupvr\r\n(Similar) Montaigne Bedside Chest https://fave.co/3VDV2ta\r\n(Similar) Black Match Striker https://fave.co/3GW7eRG\r\nBlackman Cruz Workshop Vertebrae Table Lamp https://fave.co/3VkT6Ws\r\nLawrence of La Brea Area Rug https://fave.co/3F8pwNl\r\n\r\n*Guest House*\r\n(Similar) A Particular Kind of Heaven Print https://fave.co/3gJRs1B\r\n(Similar) Yasuni Midnight Wallpaper https://fave.co/3Vmd0Rc\r\n(Similar) Ashe Upholstered Bed https://fave.co/3EPxbzE\r\n(Similar) Tonga Pillowcase Cover Black Triangle https://fave.co/3H0FCuK\r\n(Similar) Samoa Aegean Grasscloth Wallpaper https://fave.co/3AXK9u9\r\n\r\n*Dining Room*\r\n(Similar) Santa Rosa Plank Dining Table https://fave.co/3AUzy34\r\nGino Sarfatti Dining Chandelier¬†https://fave.co/3VBQ7IZ\r\n(Similar) Fishbone Cactus, Zig Zag Epiphyllum https://fave.co/3VEdEZM\r\n(Similar) Basket Burnt Rattan Large Planter https://fave.co/3VnW9xd\r\nMario Bellini Leather Chairs Set of 4 https://fave.co/3isxCs4\r\n\r\n*Living Room*\r\nSurf Tribe by Stephan Vanfleteren https://amzn.to/3OOStSF\r\n(Similar) Farmhouse Beads 58in Wood Bead Garland with Tassels https://amzn.to/3OM0wQ6\r\nDe Sede DS-85 Daybed and Lounge Chair in Cognac Leather, 1960s https://fave.co/3UqSAoU\r\nSanchez Upholstered Pouf https://fave.co/3UcMtEx\r\n(Similar) 4-Piece Gold Standing Fireplace Set https://fave.co/3Udxh9X\r\n(Similar) Chandigarh Style Small Wooden Stool¬†https://fave.co/3VDB7ud\r\n(Similar) Seminyak Grey Indoor Outdoor Cement Planter https://fave.co/3Vb0R1f\r\n(Similar) Pottery Barn Green Moroccan Handcrafted Recycled Drinking Glasses https://fave.co/3OMxVu0\r\n¬†\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nDirector: Meg Sutton\r\nDirector of Photography: Grant Bell\r\nEditor: Alex Mechanik\r\nTalent: Ellen Pompeo\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nLine Producer: Joe Buscemi \r\nAssociate Producer: Josh Crowe\r\nProduction Manager: Peter Brunette \r\nProduction Coordinator: Carol Wachockier\r\nTalent Booker: Dana Matthews, Mica Medoff\r\nCamera Operator: Lucas Vilicich\r\nProduction Sound Mixer: Gray Thomas-Sowers\r\nProduction Assistant: Fernando Barajas\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Alexa Deutsch\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Jarrod Bruner\r\nSupervising Editor: Doug Larsen\r\nAdditional Editor: Paul Tael\r\n\r\nArtwork by: \r\nAmanda Charchian Courtesy of Fahey/Klein Gallery https://www.amandacharchian.com/ \r\n\r\n¬© Douglas Kirkland All Rights Reserved http://www.douglaskirkland.com/\r\n\r\n¬© Elliott Hundley, Courtesy Regen Projects https://www.regenprojects.com/artists/elliott-hundley\r\n\r\nFahey/Klein Gallery http://www.faheykleingallery.com/ \r\n\r\nErnest C.
