{"description":"Go ‘beyond the nutshell’ at https://brilliant.org/nutshell by diving deeper into these topics and more with 20% off an annual subscription!\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant. Thanks a lot for the support!\n\nSources & further reading:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/sources-supervolcanoes/\n\nThe Earth is a gigantic ball of semi-molten rock, with a heart of iron as hot as the surface of the Sun. Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find no escape but up. Currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface. Earth’s crust is the only thing in their way. It feels solid to us, but it is only a fragile barrier, an apple skin around a flaming behemoth. True apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined, subjecting the climate to centuries  worth of change in a single year, while drowning continents in toxic ash and gases: supervolcanoes.

{"description":"Season 3 launches in THEATERS November 18 (get your info at https://www.thechosen.tv/3 ), and then comes to streaming shortly after that. If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

{"description":"The UK's recent disastrous \"mini\" Budget can trace its origins back to Britain's decision to leave the European Union.

{"description":"The Philadelphia Eagles remain the only undefeated team in the league after beating the Dallas Cowboys last night with a final score of 26-17. After Dallas headed into halftime in a 20-3 hole, they came back to narrow Philly’s lead 20-17. Ultimately, they could not stop Jalen Hurts. He had 155 yards for two touchdowns. Meanwhile, Cooper Rush struggled and had three interceptions. Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe share the biggest reasons the Cowboys lost to their NFC East rival.\n\n#Undisputed #NFL #Eagles\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n► Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n▶ First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n▶ The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n► SPEAK's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n► FOX Bet Live’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n► Club Shay Shay’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n► The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n▶ Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE\n► What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n▶ The Carton Show’s YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\nFollow UNDISPUTED on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@undisputedonfs1?lang=en\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.

{"description":"The first 1,000 people to use this link will get a 1 month free trial of Skillshare: https://skl.sh/caseyaonso10222 Thanks again to Skillshare for sponsoring! \n\nExploring the World's Messiest Girl Group: Fifth Harmony \n\nHey everyone welcome back to my channel! Today we're going to be doing a video that I've been wanting to make for YEARS but never followed through with just cause I felt like it didn't really fit the channel. Someone actually commented asking for this a few weeks back though (thank you btw! probably wouldn't have ended up doing it if you hadn't!!) so I took it as fate and thought it was about time we looked back on one of the messiest girl groups in history, Fifth Harmony. \n\nTo give a brief backstory on the group just in case you aren't aware of them, Fifth Harmony were a girl group consisting of Camila Cabello, Normani Kordei,  Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke and Dinah Jane that was formed on X Factor back in 2012. This was around the time that other X Factor groups like One Direction and Little Mix were active and doing well so they were seen as their American counterpart. After placing 3rd on the show they went on to release 2 EPs and 4 albums before going on hiatus in 2018 while Camila Cabello left the group in 2016. Since then all the girls are pursuing their solo careers. \n\nWhile Fifth Harmony has a great discography I think they're most well known for their footprint on the internet including a lot of shade, chaos and memes so I thought we could compile some of their best (and worst) moments as a group to look back on throughout all their eras from Better Together and Reflection all the way to 7/27 and their self titled era. This isn't going to be an exhaustive look at their history as a group because I wanted to focus more on the stand out moments that felt the most \"Fifth Harmony\" if that makes sense lol. But if there are moments that come to mind while watching please share them in the comments! I'm hoping that it'll be like a fun sea of chaotic memories from when the group were active lol. \n\nAs always if you enjoyed the video feel free to give it a like and subscribe it really helps me out! You can also turn on my post notifications if you wanna be notified every time I upload. But otherwise, really hope you guys enjoy and I'll see yall in the comment section!! :) \n\nSocials~*~*~*\n\n☞ IG: caseyaonso\n☞ Twitter: caseyaonso\n☞ Spotify: caseyaonso\n\n//Other videos you might like\n\nRanking Chaotic Celebrity PR Relationships\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP1pCrqoRdE\n\nA Definitive Ranking of Nepotism Babies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi_OrVeLNps\n\nA Definitive Ranking of Nepotism Babies (Part 2)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvWgFE6NubU\n\nExploring Celebrity Flop Eras\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rejqMZLcU3U\n\nA Definitive Ranking of Cringey Celebrity Couples (Part 2)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-7okUlou30\n\na definitive ranking of cringey celebrity couples\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAEH-NolOjc\n\nWhy Did Every Teen Show Age Like Milk?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgLeUeLvGsA\n\nTik Tok Turned Mental Illness into a qUirKy Trend... great\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5f0Qn09ywQ\n\nWas the Buzzfeed Era a Fever Dream?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrkTlnkPQ4k\n\ntik tok made \"i'm not like other girls\" trendy again... great  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO4IPgv8PII\n\nNetflix's Hype House Reality Show is an Absolute Disaster\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NcipNuRUzc\n\nthe true crime community is officially unhinged \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Yo3w_4qX8&ab_channel=CaseyAonso\n\nthe tik tok POV community is a disaster \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXBTmsXCYZc&ab_channel=CaseyAonso\n\nnetflix turned our worst wattpad nightmare into a movie... \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z-Cf2K2zJE&t=351s\n\nhustle culture is an absolute nightmare \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuZ-AoJb6rU&ab_channel=CaseyAonso","title":"Exploring the World's Messiest Girl Group: Fifth Harmony","duration":1014,"channel_id":"UCKGMrHJRXyM_WmPKS-lvE2A","author":"Casey Aonso","date":"20221017","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFZcrglyGis","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qFZcrglyGis/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":410998}}

These are perfect for anyone who wants to make the most of their time in the gym, but not spend half their day there.\n\n2️⃣ - This program focuses on QUALITY over quantity. We will be training at a high intensity and focusing on individual set execution to drive gains as time-efficiently as possible. \n\n3️⃣ - Even though it is a minimalistic routine time-wise there is still a lot of variety. This is important to prevent boredom and stagnation. There are a number of unique exercises and techniques I haven’t used in any of my other programs! For most exercises we will be doing just 1-3 hard sets, so we have to make them count!\n\nHere are some more details on what comes with the new program:\n\n▪️ Appropriate for all training levels (assuming you’re looking to prioritize time-efficiency)\n▪️ Option to train 2, 3, 4 or 5x per week.\n▪️ 12 week program length (3 distinct blocks to avoid monotony).\n▪️ Full custom Excel spreadsheet.\n▪️ Videos and coaching cues from me for every exercise.\n▪️ Exercise substitutions included.\n\nCheck it out here to see if it’s right for you and your goals: https://jeffnippard.com/products/the-essentials-program-preorder\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n** MacroFactor Diet App: http://bit.ly/jeffmacrofactor [FREE 2 week trial]\n\n** My Ultimate Guide To Body Recomposition:\nhttps://shop.jeffnippard.com/product/the-ultimate-guide-to-body-recomposition/\n\n** MASS (Monthly Research Review): https://bit.ly/jeffMASS\n\n** Rise Gym Apparel: https://rise.ca/jeff\n\n** PEScience Supplements: https://www.PEScience.com/discount/jeff\n\n** Instagram: https://instagram.com/jeffnippard\n\n-------------------------------\n\nReferences:\n\nMinimum Effective Dose Training Video Series by Eric Helms (MASS):\nhttps://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/2148392859/posts/2150818203\n\nTraining Volume for Strength Gains Meta-Analysis:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28755103/\n\nTraining Volume for Health Meta-Analysis:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35228201/\n\nTraining Volume for Hypertrophy Research:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27433992/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12423180/\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/232177076\n\nLeanGains Article:\nhttps://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/\n\nTraining Volume for Maintaining Muscle Size:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21131862/\n\nSchoenfeld Textbook:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Science-Development-Muscle-Hypertrophy-Schoenfeld/dp/1492597678\n\nSuperset Research:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28796130/\n\nRest Research:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28641044/\n\nMotivation Research:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968958/\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWritten by Jeff Nippard\nFilmed by Matt Dziadecki (http://instagram.com/dziadecki)\nEdited by Jeff Nippard\nResearch Assistant: Max Edsey\n\nMusic by Bankrupt Beats:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FDb0SGXtVQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaA7fM9pYA4\n\n-------------------------------\n\nIn this video I cover the minimum amount of training volume needed to see measurable gains.

The penultimate episode takes focus on the lean green Queen machine and it cements her villain arc and quest for power. In this video we're gonna be breaking down what happens in it, the easter eggs, book differences and also giving our thoughts what could happen in the finale next week.\n\nThis has been a massive season and I wanna thank you for all your support so far. We recently got our million subscriber plaque and it means more to me than a seat on the Iron Throne so I really appreciate it.\n\nNow the episode is called The Green Council and this term was coined by Grand Maester Munken in the book. The name brings a lot with it as it of course shows how this once unbiased council has now been twisted by alicent into supporting her side.\n\nWhereas the previous episodes all centred around Chapter 12 we are now in 13 which is titled the Dying Of The Dragons The Blacks Vs Greens. This war between the houses took place between 129 - 131 AC and the two years featured lots of deaths and the characters treating the Iron Thron like it's a game of musical chairs.\n\nThe period is known as the dance of the dragons but in the book its said that the phrase Dying of The Dragons is more suitable. The work is very much a chronicle of this time told to us by witnesses and maesters and it states that due to them trying to add a poetic flair to the story that they changed it to Dance.\n\nHowever it's an extremely brutal period that's described as seeing several of the last dragons being wiped out. The source material says it was a war marked by stealth, murder and betrayal which we see from this openining.","title":"HOUSE OF THE DRAGON Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Of Thrones Easter Eggs","duration":1713,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20221017","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS8A_FQKDxw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XS8A_FQKDxw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":769173}}
