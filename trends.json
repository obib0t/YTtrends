{"description":"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nBobby Carter | June 30, 2023\n\"WTF is a Tiny Desk and no!\" are the words that led to one of the most publicized journeys any musician has taken to get to NPR headquarters. That was Juvenile's response to Twitter user @theylovemyke's request for him to play a Tiny Desk concert back in April. His response ignited Black Twitter, launching a barrage of tweets and reposts of favorite performances at the Desk, as fans implored the \"T.C. soldier\" to reconsider. His viral reconsideration led to a few DMs, which led to a few phone calls, and the date was set. Juve, like some rappers in his class, had never heard of our little nook in Washington, D.C., but he soon found out.\n\nThe pressure to deliver was palpable in the planning stages but as the band was assembled, my expectations were exceeded. Tiny Desk alumni and New Orleans natives Trombone Shorty and Alvin Ford were brought into the fold. Another Tiny Desk vet from New Orleans, Jon Batiste, flew in from London just to be a part of the set. Juvenile sourced The Amours from right here in D.C. to handle background vocals, along with string players from the Louisiana Philharmonic for the grand finale. The architect of the Juvenile/Cash Money Records sound, DJ Mannie Fresh, became the glue that pieced it all together. The result was one of the most rambunctious experiences at the Desk. The Hot Boy coasted through highlights from a decades-long, groundbreaking career, concluding with a performance of \"Back That Azz Up,\" so exuberant that the audience demanded an encore and the band obliged. A Tiny Desk first.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Intro (feat. Mannie Fresh)\"\n\"400 Degreez (feat. Mannie Fresh)\"\n\"Bling Bling (feat. Mannie Fresh)\"\n\"Ha\"\n\"Set It Off\"\n\"Slow Motion\"\n\"Rodeo (feat.

{"description":"Do what must be done. #DunePartTwo only in theaters November 3.\n\nDUNE: PART TWO\n\nThe saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast. The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”\n\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).\n\n“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.\n\nVilleneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel. The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick. The executive producers are Josh Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.\n\nVilleneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West. Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.\n\n“Dune: Part Two” was filmed on location in Budapest, Abu Dhabi, Jordan and Italy. The film is slated for a November 3, 2023 worldwide release from Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Dune: Part Two | Official Trailer 2","duration":183,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

{"description":"The 2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S ($ not yet announced) may look quite familiar, but it has seen some significant changes over the outgoing model. Gone is the V8, and in its stead is the most powerful production four-cylinder engine in the world - aided further by electric power. This pumps up the new AMG C63 S to a massive 671 horsepower and 752 lb ft of torque. However it has some serious weight it needs to handle along with all of that power. \n\nThomas and James are eager to share their thoughts after spending over a thousand miles behind the wheel in Europe.

{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by Amanda Seyfried for a tour of her peaceful home in New York City. _The Crowded Room_ and _Mamma Mia!_ star spends most of her time upstate at her Catskills farmhouse, but when work calls her away she needed a tranquil city base fit for her family–with the help of Sarah Zames and Colin Stief from General Assembly they aimed to bring some of those farmhouse vibes to Manhattan. Stunning original arched windows create a bright, airy space enhanced by light oak features, and Amanda’s love of antique silhouettes paired with modern pieces offers an eclectic yet zen feel, perfect for relaxing after a busy day in the city–“I’m part of the development of a Broadway show,” Amanda says “This is going to be my home for six, seven, eight months. I know this will be where I live, and I’m comfortable here. I feel really safe.”\r\n\r\nAmanda Seyfried currently stars in The Crowded Room on Apple TV+, with new episodes debuting on Fridays through July 28, 2023.\r\n\r\nSee more of Amanda's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/inside-amanda-seyfrieds-farmhouse-inspired-new-york-city-pied-a-terre\r\n\r\nShop Amanda’s home style!\r\n\r\nFurniture: \r\n(Similar) Burrow Nomad Velvet Sofa with Chaise: https://fave.co/3NN9AFr\r\n(Similar) Joss & Main Freer Dining Table: https://fave.co/3NLC5DI\r\n(Similar) Etsy Round Wood Coffee Table: https://fave.co/43Q8D4Z\r\n\r\nLighting:\r\nLumens Crystorama Xavier Wall Sconce: https://fave.co/3JuJioU\r\nLumens Voliere Pendant by Mathieu Challières: https://fave.co/44l8Ddg\r\n(Similar) Crate & Barrel Andre 2-Light Pendant: https://fave.co/3Nq2JR2\r\n(Similar) Etsy Natural Rope Pendant: https://fave.co/3Nusi3D\r\n1stdibs Cumberland Sconce: https://fave.co/4309cIh\r\n(Similar) West Elm Sculptural Geo Sconce: https://fave.co/44dAwDG\r\n(Similar) Crate & Barrel Cane White Ceramic Lamp: https://fave.co/440q6aS\r\n\r\nRugs/Wallpaper: \r\n(Similar) Etsy Authentic Checkered Moroccan Rug: https://fave.co/44l95YG\r\nEtsy ÉLITIS Embroidered Fabric, Galactica: https://fave.co/3NlGNGK\r\n\r\nAccessories: \r\nFarrow & Ball Wimborne White Paint: https://fave.co/441VAxA\r\n(Similar) Pottery Barn Artisan Handcrafted Footed Bowl: https://fave.co/3NLwFZm\r\n(Similar) Banana Republic Fine Linen Duvet Cover: https://fave.co/3pnhrQR\r\n(Similar) Our Place Perfect Pot: https://fave.co/42XuUN6\r\n(Similar) Etsy Draped Cloth Vase: https://fave.co/3r86bbp\r\n(Similar) Liberty London Astier De Villatte Sobre Pitcher: https://fave.co/3Nv1Uq6\r\n(Similar) Etsy Mother Daughter Illustration: https://fave.co/46qPxnR\r\n(Similar) Coral & Tusk Sparklers Pillow: https://fave.co/46o8JCn\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nDesign by Sarah Zames and Colin Stief of General Assembly\r\n\r\nArtwork: Cyrielle Gulacsy, White Light 01, 2020, acrylic paint on paper, 93 x 137cm.\r\n\r\nDirector: Jasia Kaulbach\r\nDirector of Photography: Eric Brouse\r\nEditor: William Long\r\nGuest: Amanda Seyfried\r\nSenior Producer: Vara Reese\r\nLine Producer: Joseph Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Brandon Fuhr\r\nProduction Manager: Melissa Heber\r\nProduction Coordinator: Fernando Davila\r\nCamera Operator: Cloud Corredor\r\nAudio: Gabe Quiroga\r\nProduction Assistant: Francis McNeil\r\nStylist (Interior Stylist/Fashion Stylist): Sarah Zames; Colin King; Elizabeth Stewart; Eliza Yerry\r\nHair & Make-Up: Renato Campora; Genevieve Herr\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nAssistant Editor: Andy Morell\r\nColorist: Oliver Eid\n\nWant even more AD?
