{"description":"This is her Odyssey. #Furiosa - Only in Theaters 2024\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Academy Award-winning mastermind George Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,‚Äù the much-anticipated return to the iconic dystopian world he created more than 30 years ago with the seminal ‚ÄúMad Max‚Äù films.  Miller now turns the page again with an all-new original, standalone action adventure that will reveal the origins of the powerhouse character from the multiple Oscar-winning global smash ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road.‚Äù  The new feature from Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures is produced by Miller and his longtime partner, Oscar-nominated producer Doug Mitchell (‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road,‚Äù ‚ÄúBabe‚Äù), under their Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner. \n\nAs the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus.  Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.  While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.\n\nTaylor-Joy stars in the title role, and along with Hemsworth, the film also stars Alyla Browne and Tom Burke. \n\nMiller penned the script with ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road‚Äù co-writer Nico Lathouris.  Miller‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team includes first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris, director of photography Simon Duggan (‚ÄúHacksaw Ridge,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù), composer Tom Holkenborg, sound designer Robert Mackenzie, editor Eliot Knapman, visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson and colorist Eric Whipp. The team also includes other longtime collaborators: production designer Colin Gibson, editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, each of whom won an Oscar for their work on ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road.‚Äù \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, A Kennedy Miller Mitchell Production, A George Miller Film, ‚ÄúFuriosa.‚Äù  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, in theaters only nationwide on May 24, 2024 and internationally beginning on May 22, 2024.","title":"FURIOSA : A MAD MAX SAGA | OFFICIAL TRAILER #1","duration":146,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

{"description":"In this world-exclusive comprehensive First Review of the Tesla Cybertruck, Jason Cammisa tests Tesla‚Äôs Cyberbeast ‚Äî in acceleration, handling, maneuverability, dent-resistance, and safety ‚Äî and races it down the ¬º-mile against the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD and GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup.\n\n==\nThis episode of ‚ÄúJason Cammisa on the ICONS‚Äù is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nFor more info on the Cybertruck, watch Jason's \"Carmudgeon Show\" podcast here: https://youtu.be/NjIPEtegPt4\n\nNo episode of the multiple award-winning series ‚ÄúICONS‚Äù would be complete without a full helping of comedy, two side dishes of crazy action, and a cast of supporting characters. In this case, the latter incudes a 1988 Lamborghini LM002, a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12, a Ford Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV Pickup! \n\nSpecial guest appearances include Hall-of-Fame race-car driver Randy Pobst and \"Engineering Explained\" host Jason Fenske.\n\nCammisa explains the engineering behind Tesla's controversial pickup truck, including its stainless-steel (\"HFS\") exoskeleton construction, enormous aluminum castings and structural battery pack. He attends a live side-impact crash test in Tesla's Crash Lab that demonstrated how tough the skin is. And then, of course, tries to dent it with a sledgehammer. Or BFH, for those who know.\n\nThe similarities with the DeLorean go way beyond the stainless exterior ‚Äî in fact, the Cybertruck most closely resembles the famed Lamborghini LM002 pickup ‚Äî a V12-powered dogleg 5-speed off-roader, dubbed \"Rambo Lambo,\" that was as fast as a sports car. In fact, Jason reads an excerpt from the original Car and Driver magazine review of the LM002, and everything said applies directly to the Cybertruck.\n\nIncluding that the Cybertruck Cyberbeast is the quickest-accelerating pickup truck in history. Watch as it leaves the previous champion (the Rivian R1T) for dead, hitting 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and blasting through the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds at 119 mph. Cammisa reran the test on untreated (non-VHT) asphalt and got the same numbers ‚Äî¬†and marvels at how consistently the Cybertruck accelerated. Even with the Battery SoC in the mid-30-percent range after hours of consecutive runs, it still hit 60 in 2.6 seconds, and had only lost 0.3s at the quarter mile.\n\nThat newfound consistency is partially due to the new 4680 Gen 2 batteries, which are far larger than Tesla's previous 18650 and 2170 batteries, and are manufactured in-house.\n\nThe Cybertruck is nearly twice as efficient as the Hummer EV, thanks to a Lotus-like obsession with efficiency. With a battery pack of just 123 kWh, it's expected to receive an EPA Range of over 310 miles. \n\nAnd the Cybertruck is even lighter than the Rivian R1T, Hummer, and Lightning ‚Äî¬†Cammisa weighed them all. \n\nCURB WEIGHT:\nCybertruck Cyberbeast  6717 lb\nRivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD 6777 lb\nFord F-150 Lightning 6813 lb\nGMC Hummer EV First Edition 9316 lb\nLamborghini LM002 6499 lb (with 20 gallons of fuel)\n\nOf course, don't miss Randy Pobst in a kart chasing the Cybertruck around Sonoma Raceway's Go-Kart track ‚Äî or the sight of the LM002 leaning over like it's about to roll down Sonoma's famed Carousel. Or Jason backing into a stainless steel refrigerator because the Cybertruck's rear visibility is so compromised.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Cybertruck Is Real!\n1:18 Why The Cybertruck Looks Like It Does\n2:18 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs Rivian R1T Quad-Motor\n3:50 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs GMC Hummer EV\n4:25 Quickest Pickup In History: 0-60 in 2.6!\n5:20 Tesla's Engineering Efficiency\n6:23 Refrigerator Aerodynamics\n7:35 New 4860 Gen 2 Batteries\n8:11 Tesla's Price Cuts ‚Äî¬†Vertical Integration\n9:25 Jason Fenske on the Benefits of High Voltage\n10:14 48 Volts!\n11:07 How To Engineer a 48 Volt Vehicle\n11:24 Steer By Wire\n12:06 Turning Radius and Steering Demonstration\n13:07 Cybertruck vs. Go-Kart (maneuverability demo)\n16:02 One Million Pre-Orders\n16:33 Similarities to Delorean DMC-12\n17:44 Sledgehammer Door Ding Test\n18:08 Bulletproof HFS: \"Hard F-ing Steel\"\n18:44 Cybertruck Crash Test\n19:28 Tesla's Safety Record\n20:06 Pedestrian Impact Protection\n20:38 I hate it.

The Gigafactory site is littered in Cybertrucks, and Mat will have a chance to walk through the factory to take a look under the skin and find out just how impressive it is. Not only that, he‚Äôll get a chance to sit inside the Cybertruck to take a closer look at the build quality, while also asking other attendees what they make of this ultra-impressive pick-up! \n\n‚Ä¶Oh, and a certain someone called Elon will be in attendance, too.\n\nSo what do you think - will the Cybertruck live up to the hype?! And will Mat be so impressed that he actually puts a deposit down?! You‚Äôll need to stick with him for this factory walkaround to see for yourself!","title":"My Cybertruck Experience!","duration":1010,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20231201","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqcu0j3Wsys","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wqcu0j3Wsys/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGBYgVih_MA8=&rs=AOn4CLBdqvXgoZ4FmF7_-Qz7hUaxVkCyjg","content":{"View count":2160380}}

A natural draft furnace is one where the draft is supplied by convection alone. This is opposed to a forced draft where bellows or fan is used to supply air flow instead. Natural draft furnaces are typically taller than forced draft furnaces to make use of the stack effect. They also often have multiple large air entries or tuyeres to help reduce resistance to air flow. Natural draft furnaces where used to smelt iron in ancient times in Europe and up to more recently in Africa where some are still standing. The lack of the need for bellows reduces labor and complexity.\n\nThe furnace was 1.5 m tall and 25 cm internal diameter with 4 tuyeres 5 cm internal diameter. Charcoal was used as a fuel and iron bacteria was used as an ore. The smelt produced about 4 g of iron prills but could probably be improved with a longer preheat and a higher charcoal to or ratio. A second smelt was run with slag from previous smelts using 8 tuyeres this time to increase air flow.  But it made only about a gram of iron, possibly due to the slag not having much iron left in it. \n\nNatural draft furnaces do not rely on bellows or blowers and so labor is significantly decreased during a smelt. They are also simpler to operate with less components to break down or maintain. However, I've read that they use more charcoal per iron made, possibly because part of the energy from the fuel goes into supplying the air flow through the furnace. With further experimentation, I believe that my natural draft furnaces can make better yields of iron.\n\n\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #Iron Smelt #Draft Furnace","title":"Primitive Technology: Natural Draft Iron Smelt","duration":1329,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20231130","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn9tmm-_yAI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fn9tmm-_yAI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":748331}}

To test if it's actually a secret hidden room, I sent my friend Adam on his dream vacation to Japan, leaving me with just 100 hours to complete this project. I can't believe I spent over $10,000 to create my dream room, but I'm so happy with how it turned out! Watch til the end to see if Adam finds me and for a chance at the PS5!\n\nDuring this episode, Adam travels to Japan for an unforgettable adventure, completing a list of challenges along the way. Watch as he races the streets of Tokyo in a Mario kart, spends the night in a capsule hotel, eats rainbow food in Harajuku and so much more! This video is perfect for anyone who loves secret hidden rooms, Japan travel and fish!\n\nIf you have any comments, suggestions or questions for this secret hidden room or future videos, leave them down in the comments!

{"description":"What are you afraid of? Watch the new trailer for #NightSwimMovie.\nOnly in theaters January 5.\n\n--------\n\nNo running. No diving. No lifeguard on duty. No swimming after dark. \n\nAtomic Monster and Blumhouse, the producers of M3GAN, high dive into the deep end of horror with the new supernatural thriller, Night Swim. \n\nBased on the acclaimed 2014 short film by Rod Blackhurst and Bryce McGuire, the film stars Wyatt Russell (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) as Ray Waller, a former major league baseball player forced into early retirement by a degenerative illness, who moves into a new home with his concerned wife Eve (Oscar¬Æ nominee Kerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin), teenage daughter Izzy (Am√©lie Hoeferle, this fall‚Äôs The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes) and young son Elliot (Gavin Warren, Fear the Walking Dead). \n\nSecretly hoping, against the odds, to return to pro ball, Ray persuades Eve that the new home‚Äôs shimmering backyard swimming pool will be fun for the kids and provide physical therapy for him. But a dark secret in the home‚Äôs past will unleash a malevolent force that will drag the family under, into the depths of inescapable terror. \n\nNight Swim is written and directed by Bryce McGuire (writer of the upcoming film Baghead) and is produced by James Wan, the filmmaker behind the Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring franchises, and Jason Blum, the producer of the Halloween films, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man. The film is executive produced by Michael Clear and Judson Scott for Wan‚Äôs Atomic Monster and by Ryan Turek for Blum‚Äôs Blumhouse.\n\nWebsite: https://www.nightswim.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nightswimmovie/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nightswimmovie/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics","title":"Night Swim | Official Trailer 2","duration":154,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231129","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhlLO3Nb3sY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PhlLO3Nb3sY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1613097}}
{"description":"How Xi Jinping became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nXi Jinping, president of China and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is one of the most powerful political figures in the world. By initiating an unprecedented third term as China‚Äôs leader in October, 2022, Xi has signaled that he may plan to remain in power for life ‚Äì making him the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong to hold unchecked power over the People‚Äôs Republic of China. \n\nBut Xi‚Äôs connection to Mao goes deeper than a shared outlook that emphasizes unifying the party around a single leader. When Xi was just a young boy, his family ‚Äì who had held elite party status thanks to his father‚Äôs pivotal role in Mao's ‚ÄúLong March‚Äù in 1935 ‚Äì was denounced during Mao‚Äôs Cultural Revolution, a chaotic decade of purges and persecution that saw even Mao‚Äôs closest allies removed from power. During this time, a teenaged Xi was forced to work hard labor in the countryside outside of Beijing, and his father was imprisoned. \n\nXi‚Äôs subsequent rise after Mao died in 1976 was a methodical process in using his restored elite status as leverage to gain prominent party positions in rural provinces around China, culminating in his promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007.\n\nFrom there, Xi pulled from Mao‚Äôs playbook: purging his political rivals and promoting those with whom he shared close personal ties. This process undid the work of Mao‚Äôs successor, Deng Xiaoping, to prevent the consolidation of power around a single leader in China. \n\nBy the time his third term began in October 2022, Xi had reshaped the party and Chinese military leadership to be fully packed with Xi loyalists. And even in the face of social upheaval surrounding his failed Zero Covid policy, Xi has shown no sign of giving up any of the power he has consolidated since taking over as leader of the country. \n\n\nFurther reading: \n\nThese books and podcasts below helped us understand Xi Jinping‚Äôs rise, Xi‚Äôs similarities to Mao, how politics changed in the PRC since its founding, and the structure and culture of the CCP:\n\nCoalitions of the Weak by Victor Shih (Associate Professor in China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego)\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/coalitions-of-the-weak/6E99B6DB73F934166175D872B51DACD0 \n\nChinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era by Cheng Li (scholar and expert in Chinese elite politics) \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/books/chinese-politics-in-the-xi-jinping-era/ \n\nParty of One by Chun Han Wong (Reporter at the Wall Street Journal) \nhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Party-of-One/Chun-Han-Wong/9781982185732\n\nWealth and Power: China‚Äôs Long March to the Twenty-first Century by Orville Schell and John Delury \nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/161758/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury/\n\nThe Prince by Sue-Lin Wong (Correspondent at The Economist) \nhttps://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-prince\n\nThese databases and papers were also helpful in gaining a better understanding of Xi Jinping‚Äôs alliances and the CCP structure under his terms: \n\nDecoding Chinese Politics interactive by Asia Society Policy Institute \nhttps://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/decoding-chinese-politics\n\nCCP Elite Database by UCSD/Victor Shih\nhttps://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/elites/\n\nChina‚Äôs Political System in Charts: A Snapshot Before the 20th Party Congress by Susan V.

And it is not just the US but around the world. People increasingly see themselves as part of opposing teams.\n\nThere are many different reasons for this, but one gets blamed a lot: social media. Social media divides us, makes us more extreme and less empathetic, it riles us up or sucks us into doom scrolling, making us stressed and depressed. It feels like we need to touch grass and escape to the real world. \n\nNew research shows that we might have largely misinterpreted why this is the case. It turns out that the social media internet may uniquely undermine the way our brains work but not in the way you think.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ‚ù§ https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army üêß  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ‚ô¨‚ô™\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud:¬†https://bit.ly/47C0nrk\nBandcamp:¬†https://bit.ly/46QyCKt\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\nüê¶üêßüê§ PATREON BIRD ARMY üê§üêßüê¶\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nrobek, Brad Christensen, Asija Newns, Pedro Castro Verdezoto, Lucas Watkins, damien perolle, Fab Cars, alomanola, MikyF2K, Mithilesh Hinge, okor, Lucan, The Gnome, Kyung Geun Kim, Misa Brass, Martin Hippenstiel, Morgan, Anthony Distel, Filip Rogowski, Gabe, Tobias Hofmann, Zaret, Bootools, David Earl, Ben Hamilton, still [Redacted], polyploidy, Elgenzay, Jared, Soda celeste, Felix, Benjamin Goodrich, Taher Rangwala, Jesse Barnes, WillowTree, DarkKot 686, Aaron Phillips, Luc Royal, Lukas Meier, esamoth, Smithius, Mermor, Laura K√ºhne, Tyler Fendone, gassi30, Andres Arce, Suzanne frounfelter, Akito Nozaki, SirRender, Space, Daniel Hofmeister, Dan M, Jacob Culp, ReyesX77, Aaron T Haltman, DJ Dubbes, SchnarcheNoah, Keira Standing, Steven Lamontagne, Bliss, David Anderson, Uhh Uhhh Uhhh, The Paul Family","title":"The Internet is Worse Than Ever ‚Äì Now What?","duration":692,"channel_id":"UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q","author":"Kurzgesagt ‚Äì In a Nutshell","date":"20231129","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuFlMtZmvY0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fuFlMtZmvY0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3455144}}

{"description":"Russian President Vladimir Putin is laying claim to 1.2 million square kilometers in the Arctic. His main objectives appear to be the colonization of the Arctic and of the North Pole. It‚Äôs a project more than 20 years in the making.\n\nThis area, which remains virtually unexploited, is one of the last El Dorados on the planet. The subsoil is full of oil, gas, rare earths and precious minerals like gold, uranium, and copper. With global warming and the melting of the ocean‚Äôs ice, these riches are now more accessible, fueling the greed of major Western powers.\n\nBut in this conquest of the Arctic, Russia already has a head start. For years, the country has been equipped with gigantic nuclear-powered icebreakers, which have been used to help navigate the icy waters surrounding the North Pole. In addition, Vladimir Putin has invested in extraordinary industrial projects. One such project is an enormous gas processing plant anchored in the permafrost; another is the construction of an incredible floating nuclear power plant intended to supply energy to Pevek, a small, isolated port north of the polar circle. These are but a few examples of the Russian leader‚Äôs flagship projects, in this new conquest of the Arctic.\n\nFor Moscow, this policy also involves a militarization of the region. Fearful of these expansionist ambitions, NATO decided to react by sending a strong message to the Russian President. The Atlantic Alliance recently gathered of an army of 35,000 men in Norway to show that it could repel a possible Russian invasion at any given time.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

{"description":"In the co-main event, Jermall Charlo returned to the ring for the first time in 29 months with a spirited, workmanlike and ultimately dominant performance against a very game and durable Jos√© Benav√≠dez Jr., the older brother of David Benav√≠dez in their 10-round non-title bout contracted at 163 pounds. Charlo, who holds the WBC middleweight title, was the much larger man, and he pushed Benav√≠dez around the ring with his pole-like jab and hard right hands. It all added up to a wide decision for Charlo by scores of 100-90, 99-91 and 98-92 as Charlo remained undefeated at 33-0 with 22 KOs, while Benav√≠dez dropped to 28-3-1 with 19 KOs. Charlo weighed in at 166.4 pounds at Friday‚Äôs weigh-in, compared to Benav√≠dez at 161.2 pounds, but the fight was allowed to continue after both camps agreed. Charlo landed 116 of 334 total jabs for a 35% connect-rate and landed 127 of 279 power punches for a 46% clip.\n\n‚ÄúI'll be back stronger, just know that,‚Äù Charlo said. ‚ÄúI thought about everything that I've been through every round. God's got me. I want to thank everybody who never left my side. I want to thank Al Haymon for understanding me. I know when you're a man it's hard to explain to somebody what you stand for, but I'm happy that I went through what I went through because I showed myself that anything can be done.‚Äù\n\nBenav√≠dez, who was stopped by Terence Crawford in the 12th round for a welterweight title in 2018 and was an amateur prodigy, performed well against the larger foe, displaying a granite chin. But after a rusty first round, Charlo took control, exhibiting the skills that have made him one of the most entertaining and skilled fighters in the sport.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good fighter, I‚Äôm not going to make any excuses,‚Äù Benav√≠dez said. ‚ÄúI came to fight. He said he was going to back me up and I didn‚Äôt back up. I kept coming forward. The best man won tonight. It‚Äôs boxing. I thought it was way closer than the judges said it was. At the end of the day, I lost, and I‚Äôm not going to make any excuses. I don‚Äôt know if his extra weight had anything to do with it. Maybe. Maybe not. I came prepared. I gave my best.‚Äù\n\nCharlo hurt Benav√≠dez with a straight right hand toward the end of the first round after Charlo started slowly, the result of his long layoff. Charlo landed a sharp right uppercut midway through the second. Benav√≠dez briefly hurt Charlo to start the third with a jab-right hand combination, but Charlo responded with an overhand right that snapped Benav√≠dez‚Äôs head back with a minute left in the frame, and Charlo unloaded on Benav√≠dez in the fourth as Benav√≠dez covered up under Charlo‚Äôs heavy jabs and lefts. Charlo snapped Benav√≠dez‚Äôs head back with a right uppercut with 40 seconds left in the sixth, and Charlo hurt Benav√≠dez in the 10th round with a snappy right, as the two exchanged words and eventually buried the bad blood between them when the fight was over and embraced.\n\n#JermallCharlo #CharloBenavidez #JoseBenavidezJr \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Charlo vs Benavidez Jr HIGHLIGHTS: November 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":197,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20231127","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GBFFm8xrTY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5GBFFm8xrTY/hqdefault.jpg?v=65652555","content":{"View count":524196}}

{"description":"David ‚ÄúEl Monstruo‚Äù Benav√≠dez lived up to his nickname and billings as perhaps the sport‚Äôs most destructive offensive weapon as he defended his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title and blitzed former two-division champion Demetrius ‚ÄúBoo Boo‚Äù Andrade with a stoppage after the sixth round in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night headlining a Premier Boxing Champions event from Michelob ULTRA Arena at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.\n \nThe ending came after Andrade‚Äôs trainer wouldn‚Äôt allow their charge to leave the corner to start the seventh round after Benavidez, fighting his first southpaw in seven years, bloodied and pounded Andrade in perhaps the signature performance of his career. Benav√≠dez (28-0, 24 KOs) remained undefeated as Andrade (32-1, 19 KOs) suffered his first loss.\n \n‚ÄúI think I just solidified myself as a dominant force here,‚Äù Benav√≠dez said. ‚ÄúI just reminded everyone who the real champion at 168 is. Who wants to see me versus Canelo? I'm going to be super middleweight champion of the world, three-time world champion. Now just give me the fight that we all want to see. Who wants to see Benav√≠dez versus Canelo?‚Äù\n \nBenav√≠dez punctuated his performance with an embrace of Mike Tyson outside the ring following the stoppage. Tyson famously dubbed Benav√≠dez the ‚ÄúMexican Monster.‚Äù\n \n\"I just told Mike Tyson that I love him and thank you so much for the motivation he's given me,‚Äù Benav√≠dez said. ‚ÄúIt's not every day a boxing legend like Mike Tyson gives people nicknames, so I just want to live up to my name.\n \n‚ÄúEverybody says I'm not this, I'm not that, I'm flat-footed, I have no defense. This guy probably applied one of the best defenses. He's really good offensively. He could barely even hit me, so I think that says a lot on its own. I just have to keep beating who they put in front of me. I'm the best. I'm going to be the best. I'm going to be a legend by the time I'm done, so whoever you keep putting in front of me, I'll keep knocking them down.\n \n\"Let's give the people what they want to see. They want to see Benav√≠dez versus Canelo.\"\n \nJust as he did against Caleb Plant in March, Benav√≠dez grew stronger and more dangerous as the fight wore on. After Andrade held his own in the opening rounds, Benav√≠dez broke down his 35-year-old opponent with breathtaking efficiently. A looping right hand from Benav√≠dez to the side of the head dropped Andrade for the third time in his career with seconds left in the fourth round. Andrade crumpled to the canvas and rose on shaky legs to survive the round.\n \nBenav√≠dez hurt Andrade again with a left to start the fifth round as he continued to walk Andrade down and land hard punches. Andrade‚Äôs right eye started to close midway through the frame as Benav√≠dez teed off on his 35-year-old opponent with a right uppercut and an assortment of short, stinging punches. Andrade took a stand with a minute left in the sixth, uncorking a right uppercut but Benavidez hurt Andrade, a former 2008 U.S. Olympian, with left that had him stumbling across the ring.\n \nIt was a far cry from the start of the fight when Andrade was able to smother Benav√≠dez‚Äôs punches, darting in and out and winging shots from odd angles that found their mark. Andrade looked sensational in the first two rounds, while Benav√≠dez bided his time, carefully picking his shots. Andrade started to slow down in the third, allowing Benav√≠dez to unload his brand of destructive, compact punches before the knockdown turned the tide in Benav√≠dez‚Äôs favor.  \n \n‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back ‚Äì back to the drawing board,‚Äù Andrade said. ‚ÄúI moved up in weight classes. I‚Äôll work on my body a little more and I‚Äôll be right back at it. I thought overall I did everything I needed to do to get the bigger man off me. David's definitely a hell of a fighter. Nobody was even willing to get in the ring with him. I tried to become a three-division world champion. That's not far-fetched. David was the man tonight. Benav√≠dez is the bigger man.‚Äù\n\n#BenavidezAndrade #DavidBenavidez #DemetriusAndrade \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Benavidez vs Andrade HIGHLIGHTS: November 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":187,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20231126","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtH8RT352o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hdtH8RT352o/hqdefault.jpg?v=6562ebd6","content":{"View count":1678896}}

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! So, I found something... a few months ago, while we were trying to film a video where I let TikTok ads pick my outfits, I stumbled upon... this dress. It goes by a few names but it's most commonly some version of the \"floral midriff shaper corset sundress\" - and after buying one for the video, my for you page started getting flooded with TONS of ads for what looked like the same dress - but all from different companies, and with wildly different price points. So, I decided - let's buy a few of these bad boys and see what actually ends up at our doorstep - and find out, what the heck IS up. Where are all these dresses coming from? Are they all the same dress? Clearly someone is lying here - but who?

{"description":"She's probably the most powerful woman in North Korea: Kim Yo Jong, the dictator‚Äôs younger sister. She‚Äôs viewed as an emotionless and shrewd strategist for her brother, the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un. But just who is the \"Red Princess\"?\n\nKim Jong Un‚Äôs rise began in 2011 when their father, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il died at the age of 69. His death triggered emotional scenes including, at the funeral, that of a weeping woman who captured the attention of her country and the entire world: Kim Yo Jong.\n\nThis was Kim Yo Jong‚Äôs first official appearance alongside her brother Kim Jong Un, the new Supreme Leader of North Korea. Within a decade, Kim Yo Jong became the second highest ranking person in the Pyongyang regime and thereby her brother‚Äôs potential successor.\n\nKim Yo Jong holds a multifaceted political role: on the one hand, she knows where and when to deploy her charm -- such as on a visit to South Korea in 2018. But she also issues warnings against the \"imperialists‚Äù of Seoul and Washington. The documentary examines the personality and the career of the \"Red Princess‚Äù. It also takes a current look behind the scenes of this totalitarian regime. The nuclear power is mired in a crisis that originated at the outset of the Cold War.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
