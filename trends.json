{"description":"(Sept. 4, 2022) Top lightweight contender Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz (24-2-1, 17 KOs) delivered a highlight-reel knockout over veteran contender Eduardo Ramirez (27-3-3, 12 KOs) in the second round of their showdown.\n \nAlready a fan-favorite after giving three-division world champion Gervonta Davis all he could handle in defeat at this same arena last December, Mexico City’s Cruz entered the ring to roaring approval as he looked for another statement victory.\n \n\"I was ready to win at all costs, for my family and what better way to win than here in front of all the great fans in Los Angeles,” said Cruz.”\n \nMidway through round two, Davis showed the fight-changing power that he possesses and that has helped make him a fan favorite in Los Angeles and beyond. Cruz first connected flush with a big left hook around a Ramirez jab that sent Ramirez to the mat hard.\n \nWhile Ramirez was able to get to his feet, Cruz pushed forward, sensing his moment to end the fight. Using a feint right hand, Ramirez caught Cruz cleanly with another left hook and followed up with a powerful right hand to score a second knockdown. This time referee Jack Reiss jumped in immediately and halt the bout 2:27 into the round.\n \n\"I lost and I have to accept that,” said Ramirez. “I'll get better and move forward. I felt like I was fighting well and then everything turned all of a sudden. That's just boxing. Now I'm going to rest, recover and plan my next moves going forward. But I'll definitely be back, you can count on that.\"\n\n#IsaacCruz #EduardoRamirez #CruzRamirez \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Cruz vs Ramirez FIGHT HIGHLIGHTS: September 4, 2022 | PBC on FOX PPV","duration":120,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20220905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7naL2FFdg2Y","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7naL2FFdg2Y/hqdefault.jpg?v=6315aca0","content":{"View count":684212}}

Though we don’t see those events in the Dragon Ball Super manga just assume it’s basically the same as the movie. Goku and Vegeta are training and talking about never fighting together again and doing all the other flirting you’d expect. Vegeta asks about Ultra Instinct but Goku says he hasn’t been able to use it a single time since the Tournament of Power. Their date gets interrupted by a call from Mr. Satan. Buu is being kidnapped so he needs Goku and Vegeta’s help.\n Goku tells Vegeta he’ll teleport them over, but Vegeta acts like a tsundere and says he’ll just fly there himself. Goku arrives first and handles the kidnappers. Vegeta gets there shortly after, but lets Goku handle it. One of the kidnappers hears Mr. Satan say Goku and Vegeta. He knows who they are and proceeds to effortlessly speed blitz both of them. Defeating them both with a stun gun. He tells the others to take Goku and Vegeta as well so with that, the kidnappers leave Earth.

{"description":"After manufacturing's 40-year cycle of decline in the U.S., officials in Washington are trying to bring it back. This move could be a boom or bust for huge swaths of the American Midwest. This region once dominated the auto industry before rising global trade and automation sent domestic manufacturing employment into a tailspin. U.S. leaders hope that new laws such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will help businesses create the green manufacturing jobs of the future.\n\nResearchers believe modern factory jobs will require more education and could be less available than they were in the past. They estimate that electric vehicles could require 30% less manufacturing labor when compared with conventional cars. \"The lines that run to drive oil or gas around an internal combustion engine aren't going to be there,\" said Cooley.\n\nLeaders in Washington hope two key pieces of legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, which were signed into law by President Joe Biden in August, will provide a bridge to that future. These laws authorize billions in incentives for businesses that pursue clean energy manufacturing.\n\nWatch the video to learn more about how the electric vehicle revolution will impact the economies of states across the U.S. Midwest.\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

If anyone is interested here’s an AFFILIATED LINK to the discs I ordered. https://amzn.to/3e7N3DS However I can’t guarantee you’ll receive SACDs like I did ...but I also don’t see why you wouldn’t. \n\n------------- Merchandise -----------------\nNew Techmoan Merchandise is now available. https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/nerdkeyz?ref=seller-platform-mcnav&section_id=37136753\n\n--------------- SUBSCRIBE ------------------\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1\n\n------------- SUPPORT ---------------\nThis channel can be supported through Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/techmoan\n  \n*******Patrons usually have early access to videos*******\n\n---------- Outro Music -----------\nOver Time - Vibe Tracks https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw\n\n------ Outro Sound Effect ------\nThatSFXGuy - https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM\n\n------ AFFILIATED LINKS/ADVERTISING NOTICE -------\nAll links are Affiliated where possible.\nWhen you click on links to various merchants posted here and make a purchase, this can result in me earning a commission.

The track is a perfect fusion of dance/electronic music and Latin pop vibes, featuring Loaiza's sultry Spanish vocals and organic melodies atop a deep, rhythmic bassline. Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike bring their dynamic style with a new twist, further demonstrating their abilities as producers to cross and blend genres with ease, also delivering a prime example of how to successfully revive a timeless dance classic, as \"Fuego\" features samples of Mr. President's \"Coco Jamboo\" from 1996. Whether you're turning up the volume on your speakers or hearing it live at your favorite venue, things are about to get muy caliente when \"Fuego\" comes on. This is the second time the duo has collaborated with Kim Loaiza, following 2020's \"Do It!,\" which is currently sitting at over 80M streams on all platforms combined and clocking up 316K TikTok videos. The Belgian duo premiered \"Fuego\" earlier this year at EDC Mexico and Tomorrowland, featuring a live performance by Kim Loaiza, and now fans get the full version to bring back great memories.\n\nFollow Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike on Spotify:\nhttp://dimitrivegasandlikemike.com/spotify\n\nRelive the MADNESS with these exclusive Spotify playlists:\nBringing The Madness Playlist:\nhttp://dimitrivegasandlikemike.com/spotifymadness\nThe Official Tomorrowland Playlist:\nhttp://tomorrowland.com/spotify\nThe Smash The House Radio Playlist:\nhttp://smashthehouse.com/spotify\n\nSubscribe yourself for more Tomorrowland Music on: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SmashTheHouse\n\nFollow us on social media:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/dimitrivegasandlikemike\nhttp://www.instagram.com/dimitrivegas\nhttp://www.instagram.com/likemike\nhttp://www.facebook.com/dimitrivegasandlikemike\nhttp://www.twitter.com/dimitrivegas\nhttp://www.twitter.com/likemike\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@dimitrivegasandlikemike\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/dimitrivegasandlikemike\n\nSign up: http://eepurl.com/b3xUuf","title":"Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike x Kim Loaiza - Fuego (Official Music Video)","duration":199,"channel_id":"UCxmNWF8fQ4miqfGs84dFVrg","author":"Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike","date":"20220902","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMCnyJgEjnA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rMCnyJgEjnA/hqdefault.jpg?v=63109ceb","content":{"View count":2820656}}

Sand contains a minor proportion of iron in the form of magnetite (and some hematite), the rest of the sand being other non iron minerals such as silica.  In this form it is not concentrated enough to use as an ore to produce iron metal. However, it is possible to concentrate the magnetite grains from the silica sand using gravity separation, as magnetite is heavier than silica sand. \n\nSo, I made a sluice box from a spare roof tile I made in an earlier video. The curved tile acts as a chute and grooves were carved into the concave surface perpendicular to it's length. When sand was put into the sluice and water was run over it, the heavier magnetite got trapped in the grooves and most of the lighter sand was washed away. The trapped iron sand was then tipped into a collection pot. This sand was then sluiced a second time to concentrate it further. From experiment, it was found that sluicing twice yields the best result for effort, sluicing a 3rd time does little to further concentrate the ore.\n\n A furnace was then built and the ore tested. About 500g of charcoal and 200g of iron sand were charged every 5 minutes, for 6 charges. The result was a small amount of iron in the form of some cast iron spherical prills (similar to other smelts I've done) and jagged coral like formations, also of cast iron (a form new to me). When comparing the result to my usual ore, iron bacteria, it produces about the same amount of iron but with a different shape. \n\nThe benefit of using iron sand as an ore is that it can be found in almost all geological areas that have a creek or river, though the iron will be more concentrated in some areas than others. I did this experiment in a basalt rich geological location but have heard that sand formed from granite produces even better results. In summary, Iron sand, though laborious to process is easily found in most creeks, rivers and beaches and so this technique of benefiction is worth learning. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #iron  #sand","title":"Primitive Technology: Making Iron From Sand","duration":609,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20220901","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPIUMpiV0IY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OPIUMpiV0IY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1958949}}

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#quandorondo #nbayoungboy #rip","title":"Quando Rondo x NBA YoungBoy - Give Me A Sign (Official Audio)","duration":169,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20220830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpvqSEDMrl4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/mpvqSEDMrl4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1784863}}
