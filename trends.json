The reality was a bloody lie. When Elizabeth Holmes claimed she'd invented a device that with a pinprick of blood could diagnose hundreds of medical conditions, she became the darling of Silicon Valley. Holmes, along with her business partner and ex-lover Sunny Balwani, then set about duping investors to bankroll their multi-billion dollar company, Theranos. But what the couple didn't count on was the courage of two of their own staff who knew the blood machine didn't work, and knew they had to tell the world. Now Holmes and Balwani have been found guilty of fraud and could face decades in jail.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 We Sold Our Catamaran!\n00:52 Prepping to Leave Forever\n02:45 Why We're Leaving Everything Behind\n05:02 Storm's A Comin\n05:56 Packing for the South Island of NZ\n07:16 The Mementos We Can't Leave\n09:15 Impromptu Tour of a Sunreef 62' Cat\n17:59 One Last Chambong Celebration\n19:42 The Interior Reveal of our HH44\n22:48 The last Hours on CURIOSITY 😢\n24:11 Help Us Plan Our NZ South Island Trip!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"The End of Boat Life","duration":1569,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNwt_HBqxpg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZNwt_HBqxpg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":275145}}

The game features an action combat playstyle that allows the player to swap between 4 individual characters in a party to quickly combo attacks. Single-player gameplay is the focus of the game, with Co-Op Mode available for certain activities.\n\nEach character has two unique combat skills: a normal skill and a special skill. The normal skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, while the special skill has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy first.\n\nCharacters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro, and Geo. Cooking is another significant aspect of Genshin Impact's gameplay. Players gather many resources in the course of their adventure, some of which can be turned into dishes via cooking. Some dishes regenerate characters' health, while others boost attack or defensive abilities.\n\n#genshinimpact #gaming","title":"I Smashed the Universe Into Pieces with 4 Heizous | Genshin Impact","duration":960,"channel_id":"UCZzxTLnsGMD-ZDH9o5MatGw","author":"itspaikon","date":"20220716","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0HQ5RhE0ek","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0HQ5RhE0ek/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":417214}}

{"description":"This September the legend begins. #TheRingsOfPower\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.\n\nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

{"description":"Go inside Madden NFL 23 with a deep dive into Franchise mode updates. Pre-order now: http://x.ea.com/73774\n\nWith new player Motivations and Tags in Free Agency, streamlined Scouting features, and enhanced transaction logic, Madden NFL 23 Franchise offers more authenticity and immersion. \n\nNew in Madden 23 Franchise:\nMotivations: Whether it is a team's chances of making the Super Bowl, its location, or its roster makeup, new player Motivations help determine why a player decides to sign with a particular team. Examples of new Motivations include: Close to Home, Franchise QB, Super Bowl Contender, and Big Market.\n\nTags: From winning the MVP award to incentives for signing veteran players as mentors, new Player Tags directly impact Free Agent logic, trade logic, draft logic, and player progression. Tags like Award Winner, Mentor, and Day 1 Starter give players more personality, drive up market interest value, and can provide XP bonuses during training.\n\nContracts: Come to terms with new contract offer presets that help streamline the negotiation process. Player Friendly, Team Friendly, Neutral, and Very Player Friendly offer presets that each come with their own risk and reward. New Rollover Cap allows you to carry over unused cap space to the next year. \n\nFree Agent Hub: The new Free Agency Hub is where you place offers, compete with other teams, manage Free Agent signings, view player Motivations and Tags, and more. You can also see players’ interest levels in signing with your Franchise. Now you can place an offer without advancing the week, which offers more opportunities to negotiate with Free Agent targets each week.\n\nScouting: With the ability to scout multiple positions at each stage as well as extra scouts to evaluate any position, you can gain important insight about more prospects faster. New Weighted Attribute Reveals uncover essential ratings first, for the position you’re scouting – like Throw Power for a QB instead of Break Tackle. \n\nDraft Classes: A complete overhaul of Draft Classes includes the addition of more than 30 new player generators, and tuning of existing ones. Now you can find unique and fun players in every round. Discover rare generational prospects who have a high overall rating and will be guaranteed an X-Factor – a valuable addition as you develop your Franchise for long-term success.\n\nMadden NFL 23 is available worldwide August 19, 2022\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 – 00:25 – Intro \n00:26 – 00:37 - Free Agency Goals\n00:38 – 02:15 – Player Motivations\n02:16 – 03:11 – Player Tags \n03:12 – 04:46 – Free Agency Hub\n04:47 – 05:07 – Contracts \n05:08 – 06:01 – Scouting \n06:02 – 06:32 – Draft Class Tuning\n06:33 – 07:16 – Trade & Draft Logic\n07:17 – End – UI Improvements","title":"Madden 23 Franchise Deep Dive","duration":482,"channel_id":"UCPpddbTbOr_uWWQT9Pw1rbA","author":"EA SPORTS MADDEN NFL","date":"20220715","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SWvkVBOAA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/44SWvkVBOAA/hqdefault.webp?v=62d01fee","content":{"View count":128405}}

{"description":"Discover how NASA engineers built and launched the most ambitious telescope of all time.\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.pbs.org/nova/ | #NOVAPBS\n\nHow did NASA engineers build and launch the most ambitious telescope of all time? Follow the dramatic story of the James Webb Space Telescope—the most complex machine ever launched into space. If it works, scientists believe that this new eye on the universe will peer deeper back in time and space than ever before to the birth of galaxies, and may even be able to “sniff” the atmospheres of exoplanets as we search for signs of life beyond Earth. But getting it to work is no easy task. The telescope is far bigger than its predecessor, the famous Hubble Space Telescope, and it needs to make its observations a million miles away from Earth—so there will be no chance to go out and fix it. That means there’s no room for error; the most ambitious telescope ever built needs to work perfectly. Meet the engineers making it happen and join them on their high stakes journey to uncover new secrets of the universe.\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

{"description":"Sponsor: be quiet!'s Silent Base 802 https://geni.us/DaGYu\nIntel's new Arc GPUs are starting to roll-out. We're looking at the Intel Arc A750 briefly, but mostly talking with Intel Graphics Engineer Tom Petersen (formerly NVIDIA) about how Arc clock control works, some of the architecture, PCIe x8 decisions, driver challenges, and more. The discussion spans from high-level basic information (like naming schemes and nomenclature for the Arc GPUs) to mid-depth technical information (like block diagrams for graphics slices and Xe cores, vectors, and SIMD topics). Because Intel is relatively new to the desktop graphics space, we needed some more architectural information and foundational knowledge to better understand the products as we review them. Tom Petersen provides much of that.\n\nWATCH OUR INTEL ARC A380 GPU REVIEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La-dcK4h4ZU\nWatch our Intel A380 Tear-Down! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoR0J9NTJyY\nWatch our deep-dive on frame rendering and some info on Intel Smooth Sync: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ENCV4xUjj0\n\nGrab a LIMITED EDITION GN CyberSkeleton foil shirt on our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/limited-edition-foil-skeletal-cotton-t-shirt-with-pc-component-design - these will only be made once and will not be made again after.

Puth’s 2020 collaboration with Gabby Barrett on their “I Hope” Remix earned him his fourth top 10 track on the Billboard Hot 100, hit number one on the Billboard “Adult Pop Songs” chart, and won a 2021 Billboard Music Award for “Top Collaboration.” Puth also co-wrote and produced The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber’s record-breaking single, “Stay,” which quickly become one of the biggest songs of 2021 and holds the title for the longest-reigning No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 chart and the first to lead it for double-digits - spending a total of eleven weeks at the top of the chart.\n\nThe official YouTube channel of Atlantic Records artist Charlie Puth.

{"description":"The new MacBook Air has Apple’s latest in-house processor, the M2. It’s got a better screen, thinner and lighter design, better speakers, a much-improved webcam, an excellent keyboard and trackpad, more convenient charging, and excellent build quality. It also comes with a higher price tag — it starts at $1,199, $200 more than the model that preceded it, and a model with a decent amount of storage runs $1,499 or more. And the performance advancements over the M1 model aren’t as stark as the design and feature improvements are. \n\nRead our review here: https://bit.ly/3AR0wJW\n\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.
