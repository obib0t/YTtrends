{"description":"The Exorcist: Believer\nOctober 2023\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.   \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own.  \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia Marcum), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil.  \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar¬Æ winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before. \n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela‚Äôs neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela‚Äôs friend.  \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award¬Æ nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.   \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty.  \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment.  \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Y√ºcer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures.  \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever","title":"The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer","duration":183,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230725","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PIxpPMyGcpU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1990484}}

Renowned since their inception for electrifying performances, The Rose quickly became one of Korea's most sought-after groups delivering a series of critically acclaimed albums that resonated with fans worldwide. In 2019, three of the band members temporarily went on hiatus to fulfill their mandatory military service obligations, during which WOOSUNG pursued a successful solo career, releasing captivating albums and embarking on sold-out world tours.\n\nIn a moment of sheer joy for their devoted fans, The Rose reunited during one of Woosung's performances in South Korea in 2022. This reunion paved the way for their first full-length album HEAL, which was inspired by the transformative power of music and the stories shared by both their fans and themselves. HEAL soared to #4 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, while their accompanying HEAL Together World Tour drew an overwhelming crowd of over 90,000 attendees.\n\nNow, with their highly anticipated second full-length album DUAL, The Rose takes their music to new heights. Building upon the emotional honesty and vulnerability showcased in HEAL, this latest offering explores the profound concept of 'balance.' Seamlessly merging light and dark elements, The Rose masterfully weaves emotions and sounds, capturing the dualistic essence that defines their music. \n\nDriven by unwavering dedication to their fans and the unbreakable bond of their friendship, The Rose continues to push artistic boundaries, captivating audiences worldwide with their soul-stirring music and unforgettable performances.\n\nÎçî Î°úÏ¶à(The Rose)Îäî ÎåÄÌïúÎØºÍµ≠ Ïù∏Îîî Î°ù Î∞¥ÎìúÏù¥Îã§.

{"description":"Step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Interstellar!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g\n\nChristopher Nolan has made a name for himself making intellectual mind-bendy movies with films like Memento, Inception and Tenet. Let‚Äôs just say it, the dude is a little obsessed with time. He‚Äôs one of the few filmmakers making truly ‚Äúepic‚Äù movies, and it‚Äôs really cool when you can understand them.\n\nInterstellar definitely raises some questions though. Like why doesn‚Äôt anyone seem to care about Tom? Why did they decide to go down to that time dilation planet first? Why did they try to collect that worthless data? Why was there a Matt Damon jumpscare on the second planet? Why did Tom name his kid Coop Cooper? Why did Cooper send the same ‚Äústay‚Äù message that he knew did not get him to stay?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Interstellar!\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N5nQPNCNkg\n\nThe Flash Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzlSBBVpbS4\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PitchMeeting\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/","title":"Interstellar Pitch Meeting","duration":366,"channel_id":"UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g","author":"Pitch Meeting","date":"20230720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhHjhdwD8gk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/xhHjhdwD8gk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":926785}}
