{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS! After many weeks... here is the video that almost defeated me, the grand finale of our Vegas trip - where we ate at every celebrity chef restaurant on the Vegas strip! Now as some of you all may know, Tyler and I are big Food Network fans - and while we were in Vegas, we decided to visit one of every celebrity chef's restaurant on the Strip! We stuffed our faces with numerous dishes, from the trash can-iest nachos at Guy Fieri's, to the elegant Italian pasta of Giada de Laurentiis, to the famed Beef Wellington at Gordon Ramsay's. Which restaurant would you try? Should we do a part 2 and go to the Jonas Brothers' restaurant?\n\nAlso, there is some controversy around foie gras that we weren't aware of before filming, our apologies.

Iron bacteria lives by oxidizing dissolved iron 2 oxide in the water table, converting it to insoluble iron 3 oxide, which precipitates out of solution forming an orange slime. This material can be concentrated to a paste that can be shaped into objects. After drying out completely, the material becomes insoluble in water just as cement does.\n\nI don't know for sure why it does this but I suspect that while it's wet, there's still some dissolved iron 2 oxide in the material. When air gets to the iron 2 oxide and converts it to iron 3 oxide it precipitates out. It then becomes a solid, cementing itself to the other iron 3 already present. This is probably why iron bacteria sometimes forms solid lumps known as bog ore. Bog ore was once primarily used for smelting into iron but was also occasionally used as a building material (not as a cement but as solid building blocks).\n\nThe potential use for this material could be as a cement-like material or mortar used in structures when iron bacteria can be found in large quantities. Fire is not used in the process as is the case with limestone or wood ash cement, and so reduces fuel consumption. It may be an appropriate use for iron bacteria contaminated with mud that might otherwise be unsuitable for smelting. Aggregates such as sand and gravel could also be added to bulk out the volume. More experiments need to be made.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

(These are affiliate links, meaning I earn a commission when you make a transaction through them. This means that even if you read for free, you are still supporting the channel.)\n\nSince November 2022, Russia has been releasing water from the Kakhovka Dam, thereby draining the reservoir behind it. This will cause all sorts of problems in Russian-held territory: it will flood the area downstream, it will limit the irrigation of agricultural fields to the south, and it might limit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's ability to cool itself. Why is Russia doing this? The straightforward answer is that it will reduce Ukraine's ability to initiate an attack in Kherson, thereby freeing up Russian soldiers to pursue an offensive in the north. But it also hints at the possibility that Russia is running low on soldiers, otherwise Moscow would not be willing to incur these costs.\n\n0:00 Does Russia Have a Manpower Shortage?\n0:48 The Draining of the Kakhovka Dam and Reservoir\n2:18 Why Would Russia Release the Dam?\n4:00 Where the Flood Goes\n5:19 Irrigation Problems\n6:54 The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Problem\n8:22 Why Russia Is Probably Running out of Soldiers\n10:04 Or Maybe Russia WAS Running out of Soldiers\n11:30 Is the Russian Winter Offensive a Failure?\n12:59 Boris Johnson's Tie\n\nThe appearance of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) visual information does not imply or constitute DoD endorsement.\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY 2.0: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/):\n\nBy IAEA:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/52339383057/in/album-72177720301779673/\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/):\n\nBy IAEA:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/8506930028\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/11083570446\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/):\n\nBy Kremlin.ru:\nhttp://kremlin.ru/news/20604\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/50329\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/57436\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/60490\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/62249\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/security-council/62933\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67061\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69390\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69465\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69737\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69743\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69756\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69800\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70159\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70315\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70341\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70414\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70565","title":"Russia Just Took a Big Dam Risk.

{"description":"as we begin the first episode of the mandalorian season 3, we get the armorer crafting a new mandalorian helmet, ceremoniously welcoming a young mandalorian boy into their creed of mandalorian’s which are the children of the watch. The same as Djin Darin. We also see Paz Vizsla there amongst them, who helped Mando in the first season. He’s pretty cool with his gattling gun. He also is a direct descendant of Tarre Vizsla I assume as they have the same last name. Tarre Vizsla was the first jedi mandalorian, whom i believe Grogu will follow suit eventually. Now, this creed is different from other mandalorian sects, in which a mando cannot remove one’s helmet in the presence of any sentient being. As they say their creed and swear on the names of their ancestors that they shall walk the way of the mandalore, a massive sea monster emerges from the ocean, giving major jurassic park meets star wars vibes. \n\nSeeking retribution for his good will, we walks into the cave of the armorer where she says you removed your helmet, you are no longer a mandalorian. if we remember from the book of boba fett, he told her this and she said he’s no longer a mandalorian for this. The reason behind this is because they’re very traditional, they’re not like new mandalorians like bo katan who follow a more relaxed ideology and much less superstitious, but also to protect them by hiding their numbers. For it’s hard to track numbers by helmet as they can all look similar, but it’s easy to count by faces.\n\nShe says redemption is no longer possible since the destruction of mandalore.\n\nHe shows her a piece of crystal from Mandalore that Jawas bought from a random traveler. She is stunned to see it as it’s impossible for anyone to take anything from Mandalore, as setting foot on the planet would kill them as it is poisoned. Clearly, it hasn’t been, since he now has this proof.\nShe says this proves that mandalore’s surface has been crystalized by fusion rays, from all the bombing from the night of a thousand tears.\n\nThey leave to Navarro 7 in hyperspace, as Grogu looks out the window to notice massive space whales travelling with them in hyperspace. These are the Purgil we was from star wars rebels who helped Ezra and took him to an unknown place, along with Thrawn. I like how they showed this, it was a nice scene, and connects Ezra, Ahsoka, and Thrawn to the timeline. Maybe we’ll see them in this season of the mandalorian, maybe we will in Ahsoka’s show only. I guess we’ll see.\n\nThey head to Navarro 7 where we meet up with Greef Carga again, as he lands down and the town looks really clean and rennovated. Lots of life, merchants, aliens from all over. It’s buzzing with droids and beings. It looks great and very star wars, unlike Kenobi which barely had any aliens in it.\n\nWe come up to the IG-11 droid statue, where his parts have been salvaged as much as possible, and he stands as a becaon of hope to all for his efforts.\n\nGrogu uses the force to spin his chair, which is the same thing Yoda did in revenge of the sith at the end of the film on polis massa, albeit he wasn’t doing it for fun, he just had to turn to talk to Obi-Wan and Bail Organa as his feet are too short to touch the ground.\n\nThey walk off and Mando gets offered the job of Ranger where he asks about Cara Dune, where it’s revealed she was promoted to special forces when she brought Moff Gideon in. It’s a better send off for Cara than saying she’s dead or something, but I still wish she was in the show and that Gina didn’t get fired. Moff Gideon was sent to a New Republic War Tribunal.\n\nHeading to his final destination of the episode, Mando and Grogu arrive to kalevala, another planet in the mandalorian system and home to house Kryze as they come to a Mandalorian Castle…where Bo Katan is kicking her feet up on her empty throne, alone. They gave her a new wig this season and it looks very much like her animated form.\n\nShe’s melancholy because when she arrived back to her people without the dark saber, she lost all respect and her authority to lead them. She’s mad about it, and blames the children of the watch and all factions before it for dividing their people, instead of uniting them. She is of the new mandalorians who don’t care for such trivial uptight traditions like forbidding ones from removing helmets.\n\nShe says goodbye din djarrin in a nefarious tone…either she gave him some wack gps location where he’s gonna get killed, or she really thinks the planet is poisoned and he won’t make it out alive. Either way, she’ll probably go there to scoop up the dark saber from his lifeless body. The way she said goodbye with that jealous and angry tone, really makes her a questionable character now…is she an ally, neutral, or foe…i guess we’ll find out next episode.\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 1 BREAKDOWN - STAR WARS IS BACK","duration":951,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20230301","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsj7FBeo0Sg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qsj7FBeo0Sg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":271320}}

Download the free Ground News app at https://ground.news/miniminuteman\n\nVIDEO INFO\nHowdy friends! In this video, we begin our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence for it.\n\nADDENDUM: At 48:00 I mistakenly class the Zigurrat at Ur as a burial structure. In reality, the Ziggurat was a temple to the Goddess of the moon. In research I got this crossed with the Royal Cemetary at Ur.

{"description":"Welcome to Sons Of The Forest! The much anticipated sequel to perfectly balanced survival game The Forrest. Similar to that game this one is rammed with various bugs, glitches and exploits that allow you to dupe items and break the laws of physics! Today we will be doing just that by showing one of the fastest and easiest ways to beat the game using just a stick! That's right, this entire 20+ hour game can be beaten with just a stick as sticks allow you to faze through reality. This is rather similar to an exploit in the forest that allowed you to speedrun through all of the locked keycard doors in the game! \n\nToday I will be crossing the entire survival island bypassing the keycard door into the underground lab. Skipping the 3d printing section and going straight for the endgame by sticking my way through the super special final secret door! Sure you might watch a beginer tips and tricks video telling you what to do and how to play the game. Or you could watch The Spiffing Brit explain how to break the laws of reality and bypass all of that fun sons of the forest gameplay with a good old fashion stick take that ign! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:40 - Crash Landing\n01:55 - We're off on an adventure!\n05:23 - The British Space Program\n08:25 - A Stick-y situation\n10:03 - Thinking outside the box\n11:31 - Spelunking\n14:12 - Finishing the Game\n16:36 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nDisclaimer: I am not sure who first discovered the stick glitch as I am 90% certain I am not the first to learn you can glitch the doors using sticks in both of the games. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: How I Beat SONS OF THE FOREST...

{"description":"All roads have led to this. Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso\n\nIn the third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them to finish last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.\n\nSong: \"You Can’t Always Get What You Want\" by The Rolling Stones https://apple.co/YouCantAlwaysGetWhatYouWant\n\nAudio Description Version available: https://apple.co/TedLasso-\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Ted Lasso:\nhttps://twitter.com/TedLasso\n\nFollow AFC Richmond:\nhttps://twitter.com/AFCRichmond\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple TV+\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTVPlus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTVPlus\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

{"description":"NASCAR continued its west coast travels with the Pala Casino 400 as Ross Chastain and Kyle Busch started stage one with a fury! Busch was a strong contender to win the first stage until he suffered a pit-stop penalty which played a role into Busch finishing 12th. Chastain cruised to a comfortable first-place finish. Chastain continued this theme in the second stage where he again finished in first place, followed by Kyle Busch and Joey Logano. However, in the final stage, Busch took it to another level and was able to win the Pala Casino 400. With the victory, Busch holds the all-time record for consecutive cup seasons with a victory at 19 and is now ninth in the all-time victories list.\n\n#NASCARonFOX #NASCAR #Fontana\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOX\nLike NASCAR on FOX on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXFacebook\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXTwitter\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXInstagram\n\nAbout NASCAR on FOX:\nYour home for NASCAR on FOX, from Raceday to Radioactive and all of the racing action in between.\n\n2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX\nhttps://youtu.be/ZXJyURa1Cww\n\nNASCAR on FOX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/NASCARonFOX","title":"2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX","duration":832,"channel_id":"UCWw4HqQcexuZfeFd4XLrNNg","author":"NASCAR on FOX","date":"20230227","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJyURa1Cww","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXJyURa1Cww/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":303026}}

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n#arctictrain #travel #sweden #norway\n\n00:00 intro/spoilers :)\n00:44 arctic train # 1 🗻\n04:10 world’s largest ice Hotel❄️\n13:57 NORTHERN LIGHTS🤩\n16:22 overnight sleeper train to Stockholm🛌\n24:51 showering on a train💁🏻‍♂️\n26:21 free hotel upgrade thanks to DAILY DROP!🔥\n27:13 Bloops😂","title":"Overnight Arctic Circle Train to World's Largest Ice Hotel","duration":1683,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20230225","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYFZFQeuXBE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/KYFZFQeuXBE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":921649}}
