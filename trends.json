{"description":"On satellite imagery, we spotted a village inside a strange crater in Madagascar. We set out to learn how it got there.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRight in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there‚Äôs a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris ‚Äî and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there‚Äôs a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. \n\nWhen we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It‚Äôs a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. \n\nWe got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:\n\nHere is some of Michel J√©brak‚Äôs research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32048440_Resolving_the_Richat_enigma_Doming_and_hydrothermal_karstification_above_an_alkaline_complex\n\nHere is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi‚Äôs original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318723814_Petrogenesis_of_the_Ambohiby_Complex_Madagascar_and_the_role_of_the_Marion_Hotspot_plume\n\nWe also spoke with Stian Rice, author of Famine in the Remaking, who helped us understand more about the history of agriculture in Madagascar:  https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/01/24/madagascars-famine-is-more-than-climate-change/\n\nCheck out Stian‚Äôs book on famine and food systems: https://wvupressonline.com/node/831\n\nNorman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell‚Äôs SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is out now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC! ü•≥\n\nGrab your digital or physical copy and experience every story Night City has to offer. ‚ú®\n\nhttps://cyberpunk.net/buy\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is an open-world, action-adventure RPG containing every story set in Night City, featuring a host of memorable characters including rebellious rockerboy Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) and veteran secret agent Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba). Play as V, a cyberpunk mercenary, and take on the most powerful forces of the city in a fight for glory and survival. Dive into the base game, its critically acclaimed spy-thriller expansion Phantom Liberty, and experience the game-changing Update 2.0 ‚Äî all in one package. Legends are made here. What will yours be?\n\nDescriptive text:\n\nA trailer made up of dynamic cuts between gameplay footage from Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty interspersed with live-action scenes of actors Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba.\n\nGame footage shows the silhouette of Solomon Reed, a dark-skinned man in a brown leather trench coat, shooting a gun at an unseen enemy. Soldiers jump out of an AV into a burning building. An explosion throws President Myers, a white woman in a pantsuit, to the ground. Trauma Team employees defibrillate a woman. A police car explodes.\n\nAn AV flies over a sweeping expanse of Night City. A black title card reads: ‚ÄúAn Unprecedented Revival. The Guardian.‚Äù An enormous pyramid-shaped building glows in Dogtown. In an alleyway, a group of women beat up a man who is lying on the ground. A black title card reads: ‚ÄúAn Unforgettable Open-World Experience. Polygon.‚Äù\n\nInside of a club, Idris Elba wears a black suit jacket and walks forward as he speaks to the camera. In the game, a heavily armed MaxTac unit drops onto the ground from an AV. A MaxTac agent points a gun at V. The trunk of a car is opened to reveal an arsenal of weapons. A red-haired woman winks at V over a roulette table.\n\nKeanu Reeves speaks. In the game, characters dance on a crowded dance floor. Four musicians stand on stage as the audience applauds. A rock band plays on a cramped stage with the Samurai logo behind them. A blue-haired woman looks up at V.\n\nKeanu Reeves walks backwards as he speaks. In Cyberpunk 2077, an intimidating cyborg soldier with red eyes walks past. Dogtown leader Kurt Hansen is trailed by two loyal soldiers. A man covered in implants and with a cybernetic light in his forehead gestures. A woman climbs out of a storage container.\n\nIdris Elba strides forward in the club. In the game, V pierces an enemy‚Äôs chest with two electric blades then knocks another enemy back with a shotgun blast. V drives a sleek Quadra car through Night City streets. A masked enemy swings two glowing red blades at V.\n\nArmed forces exit an AV, guns aimed forward. A powerful pistol blast explodes a motorcycle in mid-air. A silver-skinned woman floats aboveground in a holographic light show. V faces down various enemies and a large battle tank.\n\nThe Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition logo glitches into view. Below are the words ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù.

Klatt then goes through how the sport got to this point with the era of the 4-team Playoff format and how it has hurt the sport as a whole.

{"description":"Be sure to check out today‚Äôs episode of Game Theory, where this song features! https://youtu.be/3JZeI9SF0lI\n\nAll new Stupendi-Merch NOW AVAILABLE!\nhttps://freshstore.co/collections/the-stupendium\n\nGame Theory, along with its host Matthew ‚ÄòMatPat‚Äô Patrick, is a channel that every week takes you on a deep dive behind the lore and the science of your favourite games. I‚Äôve never done a collaboration like this before but it was wonderful to get the chance to work with and promote a smaller, up-and-coming channel. I‚Äôve no doubt you‚Äôll all be hearing about them any day now. I see big things!\n\nIn all seriousness though, WOW. As a long-time fan of the theory channels getting to work on this with MatPat and his team was such an honour. This project has been in the works for the longest time and it‚Äôs been so hard to keep it a secret for all this time! (Wondering why there are no Style Theory lyrics? That channel didn‚Äôt exist when this was written!)\n\nI am so incredibly grateful to the whole theory team for this opportunity. In fact, I‚Äôm doubly thankful because when I initially pitched this project to them the idea was that I would have the song to publish on my music platforms but that the music video would go to the Game Theory channel. But after work on the project began MatPat said he wanted to find a way to make sure the collaboration benefited my channel as much as possible, instead gifting the full music video to my channel even though it had been entirely edited by the Game Theory team. (Shout out to the wonderfully talented Tyler Mascola!)\n\nSo, instead a plan was formulated to feature the music video as part of a larger Theory video whilst the full standalone music video would be here! I cannot express enough my gratitude to Matt and the whole team. Every one of them was a joy to work with as we put this together.\n\nSo, if you‚Äôre new here, joining me from today‚Äôs video over on Game Theory, welcome!

{"description":"Mat has returned to the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin Texas, and he‚Äôs got his hands on the all-new Cybertruck! So of course, you know what that means‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs drag race time! \n\nNaturally, there was only one competitor that we had to compare this all-electric pick-up to - the Hummer EV! The question is, which will come out on top? \n\nWell, let‚Äôs check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it‚Äôll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. \n\nThink that‚Äôs heavy? Well, that‚Äôs nothing compared to the Hummer, which comes in at 4,110kg!! Just like the Tesla, the Hummer is equipped with three motors, but it‚Äôs also up on power, producing 1,014hp and 1,485Nm! The price is also slightly higher than the Cybertruck, coming in at around ¬£109,000.\n\nSo how will this one play out? Will the extra tonne of weight prove decisive? There‚Äôs only one way to find out‚Ä¶ LET‚ÄôS RACE!","title":"Tesla Cybertruck DRAG RACE","duration":1026,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20231202","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1v0FNR3-Xc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/D1v0FNR3-Xc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4349014}}

{"description":"In this world-exclusive comprehensive First Review of the Tesla Cybertruck, Jason Cammisa tests Tesla‚Äôs Cyberbeast ‚Äî in acceleration, handling, maneuverability, dent-resistance, and safety ‚Äî and races it down the ¬º-mile against the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD and GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup.\n\n==\nThis episode of ‚ÄúJason Cammisa on the ICONS‚Äù is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nFor more info on the Cybertruck, watch Jason's \"Carmudgeon Show\" podcast here: https://youtu.be/NjIPEtegPt4\n\nNo episode of the multiple award-winning series ‚ÄúICONS‚Äù would be complete without a full helping of comedy, two side dishes of crazy action, and a cast of supporting characters. In this case, the latter incudes a 1988 Lamborghini LM002, a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12, a Ford Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV Pickup! \n\nSpecial guest appearances include Hall-of-Fame race-car driver Randy Pobst and \"Engineering Explained\" host Jason Fenske.\n\nCammisa explains the engineering behind Tesla's controversial pickup truck, including its stainless-steel (\"HFS\") exoskeleton construction, enormous aluminum castings and structural battery pack. He attends a live side-impact crash test in Tesla's Crash Lab that demonstrated how tough the skin is. And then, of course, tries to dent it with a sledgehammer. Or BFH, for those who know.\n\nThe similarities with the DeLorean go way beyond the stainless exterior ‚Äî in fact, the Cybertruck most closely resembles the famed Lamborghini LM002 pickup ‚Äî a V12-powered dogleg 5-speed off-roader, dubbed \"Rambo Lambo,\" that was as fast as a sports car. In fact, Jason reads an excerpt from the original Car and Driver magazine review of the LM002, and everything said applies directly to the Cybertruck.\n\nIncluding that the Cybertruck Cyberbeast is the quickest-accelerating pickup truck in history. Watch as it leaves the previous champion (the Rivian R1T) for dead, hitting 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and blasting through the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds at 119 mph. Cammisa reran the test on untreated (non-VHT) asphalt and got the same numbers ‚Äî¬†and marvels at how consistently the Cybertruck accelerated. Even with the Battery SoC in the mid-30-percent range after hours of consecutive runs, it still hit 60 in 2.6 seconds, and had only lost 0.3s at the quarter mile.\n\nThat newfound consistency is partially due to the new 4680 Gen 2 batteries, which are far larger than Tesla's previous 18650 and 2170 batteries, and are manufactured in-house.\n\nThe Cybertruck is nearly twice as efficient as the Hummer EV, thanks to a Lotus-like obsession with efficiency. With a battery pack of just 123 kWh, it's expected to receive an EPA Range of over 310 miles. \n\nAnd the Cybertruck is even lighter than the Rivian R1T, Hummer, and Lightning ‚Äî¬†Cammisa weighed them all. \n\nCURB WEIGHT:\nCybertruck Cyberbeast  6717 lb\nRivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD 6777 lb\nFord F-150 Lightning 6813 lb\nGMC Hummer EV First Edition 9316 lb\nLamborghini LM002 6499 lb (with 20 gallons of fuel)\n\nOf course, don't miss Randy Pobst in a kart chasing the Cybertruck around Sonoma Raceway's Go-Kart track ‚Äî or the sight of the LM002 leaning over like it's about to roll down Sonoma's famed Carousel. Or Jason backing into a stainless steel refrigerator because the Cybertruck's rear visibility is so compromised.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Cybertruck Is Real!\n1:18 Why The Cybertruck Looks Like It Does\n2:18 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs Rivian R1T Quad-Motor\n3:50 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs GMC Hummer EV\n4:25 Quickest Pickup In History: 0-60 in 2.6!\n5:20 Tesla's Engineering Efficiency\n6:23 Refrigerator Aerodynamics\n7:35 New 4860 Gen 2 Batteries\n8:11 Tesla's Price Cuts ‚Äî¬†Vertical Integration\n9:25 Jason Fenske on the Benefits of High Voltage\n10:14 48 Volts!\n11:07 How To Engineer a 48 Volt Vehicle\n11:24 Steer By Wire\n12:06 Turning Radius and Steering Demonstration\n13:07 Cybertruck vs. Go-Kart (maneuverability demo)\n16:02 One Million Pre-Orders\n16:33 Similarities to Delorean DMC-12\n17:44 Sledgehammer Door Ding Test\n18:08 Bulletproof HFS: \"Hard F-ing Steel\"\n18:44 Cybertruck Crash Test\n19:28 Tesla's Safety Record\n20:06 Pedestrian Impact Protection\n20:38 I hate it.

{"description":"This is her Odyssey. #Furiosa - Only in Theaters 2024\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Academy Award-winning mastermind George Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,‚Äù the much-anticipated return to the iconic dystopian world he created more than 30 years ago with the seminal ‚ÄúMad Max‚Äù films.  Miller now turns the page again with an all-new original, standalone action adventure that will reveal the origins of the powerhouse character from the multiple Oscar-winning global smash ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road.‚Äù  The new feature from Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures is produced by Miller and his longtime partner, Oscar-nominated producer Doug Mitchell (‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road,‚Äù ‚ÄúBabe‚Äù), under their Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner. \n\nAs the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus.  Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.  While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.\n\nTaylor-Joy stars in the title role, and along with Hemsworth, the film also stars Alyla Browne and Tom Burke. \n\nMiller penned the script with ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road‚Äù co-writer Nico Lathouris.  Miller‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team includes first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris, director of photography Simon Duggan (‚ÄúHacksaw Ridge,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù), composer Tom Holkenborg, sound designer Robert Mackenzie, editor Eliot Knapman, visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson and colorist Eric Whipp. The team also includes other longtime collaborators: production designer Colin Gibson, editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, each of whom won an Oscar for their work on ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road.‚Äù \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, A Kennedy Miller Mitchell Production, A George Miller Film, ‚ÄúFuriosa.‚Äù  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

A natural draft furnace is one where the draft is supplied by convection alone. This is opposed to a forced draft where bellows or fan is used to supply air flow instead. Natural draft furnaces are typically taller than forced draft furnaces to make use of the stack effect. They also often have multiple large air entries or tuyeres to help reduce resistance to air flow. Natural draft furnaces where used to smelt iron in ancient times in Europe and up to more recently in Africa where some are still standing. The lack of the need for bellows reduces labor and complexity.\n\nThe furnace was 1.5 m tall and 25 cm internal diameter with 4 tuyeres 5 cm internal diameter. Charcoal was used as a fuel and iron bacteria was used as an ore. The smelt produced about 4 g of iron prills but could probably be improved with a longer preheat and a higher charcoal to or ratio. A second smelt was run with slag from previous smelts using 8 tuyeres this time to increase air flow.  But it made only about a gram of iron, possibly due to the slag not having much iron left in it. \n\nNatural draft furnaces do not rely on bellows or blowers and so labor is significantly decreased during a smelt. They are also simpler to operate with less components to break down or maintain. However, I've read that they use more charcoal per iron made, possibly because part of the energy from the fuel goes into supplying the air flow through the furnace. With further experimentation, I believe that my natural draft furnaces can make better yields of iron.\n\n\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
