{"description":"England and Iran faced off in the World Cup. Jude Bellingham scored in the 35th minute. Bellingham is only 19 years old and is partaking in his World Cup debut this season. England’s Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka found the net for a second and third time in the 43rd and 45th minutes to increase England’s lead to 3-0. The scoring didn’t stop there as Bukayo Saka would score again in the 62nd minute. Iran showed some life and notched their first goal of the World Cup in the 65th minute via Mehdi Taremi. Jack Grealish added a goal which marked six total for England. Iran would add a penalty kick later and the score would end up 6-2 in favor of England.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #England \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #NBAYoungBoy #ItsOn","title":"Quando Rondo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again - It's On [Official Audio]","duration":149,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20221121","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSLvMzAEZZE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KSLvMzAEZZE/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGGUgZShlMA8=&rs=AOn4CLBSZXdc5j4sZeb2-PlKHSgL9bkbAg","content":{"View count":398329}}

{"description":"Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 | The Bloody Lie (2022)\n\nFor more than a decade Elizabeth Holmes spun a despicable bloody lie. She told the world she’d invented a medical miracle. It was a machine which, with a tiny drop of blood, could almost instantly diagnose myriad diseases. Holmes promised to revolutionise healthcare, and in doing so fooled many wealthy investors. It led to her becoming a darling of Silicon Valley and an inspirational billionaire. But when whistle-blowers started questioning her claims, Holmes’ fairytale, along with her company Theranos, was destroyed. Earlier this year, Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty of fraud. Now it’s judgement day as she discovers her punishment.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

{"description":"Edited by: SimplyAJ (http://youtube.com/SimplyAJ)\n\nComplete Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtzT_jAav1xg5QU5A46bAtuJEV6b0KPUV\n\n-Rules and Explanations-\nRules: (1) Only use the one Pokémon in Battle, others for HMs are fine. (2) No Items in battle (3) No Glitches* (4) Set Mode (5) No saving in the Elite Four (6) No evasion moves\n\n*Badge Boost \"Glitch\" Explanation: When you collect odd numbered badges the game boosts a stat by 12.5%. Brock gives ATK, Surge DEF, Koga SPE, and Blaine SPC (in game text is wrong). When any of your stats are modified (even by you using a move like Withdraw, or your opponent using Leer) the badge boosts are re-applied. So If you use Swords Dance, you also gain *an additional* 12.5% in Speed/Defence/Special (on top of the 12.5% you were supposed to be getting). When you level up, the game corrects this error, and only the non-glitch 12.5% remains. Because of how difficult it is to avoid, I've allowed for it to be exploited, since opponents will spam Leer/Growl anyways, and this way battles are less random. Red/Blue are extremely buggy, so there's always going to be *some* glitches present, and because of how unavoidable this one is, it is allowed in runs, and considered more like a special Generation 1 mechanic as opposed to a glitch.","title":"How Fast can you beat Pokemon Red/Blue with just a Snorlax?","duration":1919,"channel_id":"UC5HolAcNQGGVQ6gY8QWuoKg","author":"Jrose11","date":"20221120","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVMeCWM-Fy0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/iVMeCWM-Fy0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":162881}}

{"description":"Discrete convolutions, from probability, to image processing and FFTs.\nHelp fund future projects: https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown​\nSpecial thanks to these supporters: https://3b1b.co/lessons/convolutions#thanks\nAn equally valuable form of support is to simply share the videos.\n\n------------------\n\nOther videos I referenced\n\nLive lecture on image convolutions for the MIT Julia lab\nhttps://youtu.be/8rrHTtUzyZA\n\nLecture on Discrete Fourier Transforms\nhttps://youtu.be/g8RkArhtCc4\n\nReducible video on FFTs\nhttps://youtu.be/h7apO7q16V0\n\nVeritasium video on FFTs\nhttps://youtu.be/nmgFG7PUHfo\n\nA small correction for the integer multiplication algorithm mentioned at the end. A “straightforward” application of FFT results in a runtime of O(N * log(n) log(log(n)) ). That log(log(n)) term is tiny, but it is only recently in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven found an algorithm that removed that log(log(n)) term.\n\nAnother small correction at 17:00. I describe O(N^2) as meaning \"the number of operations needed scales with N^2\". However, this is technically what Theta(N^2) would mean. O(N^2) would mean that the number of operations needed is at most constant times N^2, in particular, it includes algorithms whose runtimes don't actually have any N^2 term, but which are bounded by it. The distinction doesn't matter in this case, since there is an explicit N^2 term.\n\nThese animations are largely made using a custom python library, manim.
