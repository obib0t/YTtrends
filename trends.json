{"description":"Starship gave us quite a show during today’s first flight test of a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy rocket from Starbase in Texas. \n \nAt 8:33 a.m. CT, Starship successfully lifted off from the orbital launch pad for the first time. The vehicle cleared the pad and beach as Starship climbed to an apogee of ~39 km over the Gulf of Mexico – the highest of any Starship to-date. The vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble. The flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship. As is standard procedure, the pad and surrounding area was cleared well in advance of the test, and we expect the road and beach near the pad to remain closed until tomorrow.\n\nWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship.\n \nThank you to our customers, Cameron County, and the wider community for the continued support and encouragement. And congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting first flight test of Starship!","title":"Starship Flight Test","duration":3200,"channel_id":"UCtI0Hodo5o5dUb67FeUjDeA","author":"SpaceX","date":"20230420","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1wcilQ58hI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-1wcilQ58hI/hqdefault.jpg?v=643dc70a","content":{"View count":10941994}}

Finally, the multiple decades have seemingly allowed the Nintendo Corporation to cool off and give Mario and Luigi another shot at cashing in in Hollywood.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie definitely raises some questions. Like why was there a warp pipe under the streets of Brooklyn? Why did Princess Peach bring up her mysterious past and then not explain any further? What are these power-up boxes and how did they get there? Why didn’t Toad have to do that obstacle course, and why did Mario have to spend so much time doing it only to fail?\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Super Mario Bros.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.

Five of the derailed cars were carrying vinyl chloride, a hazardous material that built up pressure in the resulting fires, eventually leading Norfolk Southern to vent and burn it in a bid to prevent an explosion. The ensuing fireball and cloud brought the normally unseen process of hazardous cargo transportation into a single chilling view, and the event became a lightning rod of controversy over rail industry regulations, federal involvement in chemical spills, and much more.\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"At the Department of Collective Behaviour, part of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, researchers are putting locusts into simulated worlds, both virtual and physical, in the hope that they can figure out how devastating swarms form and move. ■ About the Centre: https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/ https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin\n\nEdited by Michelle Martin https://twitter.com/mrsmmartin\nThanks to David Walter for the suggestion\n\nThis is the most uncomfortable I've ever felt while filming, for a few reasons. First, of course, because of the locust swarm itself. Second, because animal research — even on creatures as simple and pestilent as locusts — always raises ethical questions. Now, the researchers are careful with the locusts, and I don't think many people could have a problem with this. Indeed, most of the world currently has zero ethical restrictions on insect experimentation — but it's still worth interrogating whether this is okay. And finally: because if we can do this so easily to less intelligent creatures... what's to stop something more intelligent coming along and doing the same to us?\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo","title":"It's the Matrix, but for locusts.","duration":424,"channel_id":"UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A","author":"Tom Scott","date":"20230417","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRIBVykhpC4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KRIBVykhpC4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGFkgWShZMA8=&rs=AOn4CLDT-NqBWWIt6LbWxzDA41VNd7teWg","content":{"View count":1882511}}

But then it's up to you to achieve success and take over New York City any way you like.\n\nSlowly build multiple small businesses, grow them into huge corporations, or carve your own unique path – the possibilities are limitless in this vast business sandbox. You've never played anything like this!\n\nGo from a small apartment and public transport to luxury suites, fast cars and designer furniture. Put your money into investment funds and real estate. Succeed, fail, rebuild. But remember to take care of yourself, sleep and stay happy on your rise to the top.\n\nDo you have what it takes to build your own empire?\n\n\nGo from nothing to the most prominent tycoon in New York. Start a business, work smart, make it thrive and enjoy your life. How do you want to be successful? How far can you push it? How long can you make it last?\n\nStart your own gift shop, supermarket, coffee shop, law firm, clothing store, liquor store, florist, and more. You decide what success is - whether it’s a single shop, a chain of fast-food restaurants, a huge corporation, or making millions developing websites.\n\nTake out a loan, rent a building, design the logo, renovate the store, get stock, manage your money, hire staff, and build your infrastructure. Soon, you may have to start importing products from the harbour and distributing them through a network of warehouses.\n\nA bigger business means managers. Hire HR Managers, Logistics Managers, and Purchasing Agents. They all need desks and computers, so you’ll need a fancy headquarters.\n\nNeed a delivery truck? Travel to a dealer and buy one. Need food? Go to a supermarket, but make sure you have a refrigerator at home. Big Ambitions is a life sim where your character has to physically interact with the world to survive and succeed.\n\nEnter any building in New York and buy it. Go from a small apartment to a dream penthouse in midtown, a luxurious townhouse in Hell’s Kitchen, or a series of skyscrapers. Fill each with furniture that suits your style and standing. Invest your hard-earned cash in real estate to grow your empire. Take over the city piece by piece.\n\nSpend your wealth however you wish. Buy a big SUV, a speedy sports car, or the new luxurious Mersaidi S500. Maybe risk it all at the casinos or put your money into investment funds and reap the rewards.\n\nAs you progress, you always need to ensure you get enough sleep and stay healthy and happy. Enjoy the journey, for as you grow older, you’ll discover that money can’t buy you time... or can it?\n\nBig Ambitions takes what you love about the viral sensation ‘Startup Company’ to even greater heights.","title":"I Became a Multimillionaire and Turned an Entire City Into a Total Wasteland - Big Ambitions","duration":1827,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20230416","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77zyN0WUuE0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/77zyN0WUuE0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2515915}}

We thought that cheese foam on bubble tea was good when we tried it on this channel, and cheesecake is good too (hey - cheese is good in general, right?), so this recipe might not be all that bad, even if it was originally intended to be an April fool’s joke.\n\nSo bring on the dairy - we’re making a Mac & Cheese Milkshake! Let us know how you think we did, and if you might want to try this lactose heavy delicacy. \n\nAlso PS - we had a slight complication with our camera on set, so the wide shot is a little soft focused.

{"description":"Bedrock: we've all been told that it's both unbreakable and unobtainable in Survival Minecraft.
