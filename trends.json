Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents.

{"description":"Sponsor: Deepcool AK620 Zero Dark on Amazon https://geni.us/apRI9Q\nASUS' actions relating to the Exploding Ryzen CPU debacle are disgraceful and abrasive to the trust that the brand has earned. ASUS has demonstrated clearly it wishes to not only avoid supporting users, but actively engineers ways to abandon them. ASUS' updates haven't even fixed the problems, yet they posture as if they have while simultaneously suggesting that users 'just run defaults' on their $700 motherboards, as if that makes any sense whatsoever. So, to accommodate ASUS' request, we ran defaults and re-benchmarked the Ryzen 7000 series. It sucks. Big surprise. They also don't support their own BIOSes for the ASUS ROG boards.\n\nSupport us!

It will demand your creativity and ingenuity in a way that few games would dare demand. It pays tribute to the things that have made this series so timeless, while also innovating so relentlessly that it will be the better part of a decade before any game is able to follow in its wake. Nearly four decades after The Legend of Zelda series made its debut, its latest instalment is a breathtaking high-point for the Zelda franchise, for Nintendo and for videogames.\n\nFor those that prefer write-ups, I've published a written version of this review over at Wellplayed.com.au.

But their mission is complicated by the beginning of a geopolitical firestorm: The American Revolution has arrived. In the seventh season of OUTLANDER, Jamie, Claire, and their family are caught in the violent birth pains of an emerging nation as armies march to war and British institutions crumble in the face of armed rebellion.\nThe land the Frasers call home is changing – and they must change with it. In order to protect what they’ve built, the Frasers have to navigate the perils of the Revolutionary War. They learn that sometimes to defend what you love, you have to leave it behind. As the conflict draws them out of North Carolina and into the heart of this fight for independence, Jamie, Claire, Brianna, and Roger are faced with impossible decisions that have the potential to tear their family apart.","title":"Outlander | Season 7 Official Trailer | STARZ","duration":162,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxurD9SYbog","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gxurD9SYbog/hqdefault.jpg?v=645d26e3","content":{"View count":1207933}}

Maybe you’ve seen it as glowing green goop in The Simpsons, or as a  radioactive threat on the news. Either way, you likely know it has been a major block to the use and improvement of nuclear power. Over the last few decades, experts, politicians and the public have had heated debates over what to do with this radioactive material created by nuclear power plants.\n\nBut what if there were a way to not just store nuclear waste, but actually USE it? \n\nThis video is about the effort to make electricity out of nuclear waste. Really. It turns out, we developed the tools to do this decades ago. This story is about a technology we left behind and the people who want to bring it back.\n\nFor this video, I had the privilege of visiting one of the largest and oldest research centers in the US, the Argonne National Laboratory. I’m incredibly grateful to the researchers and staff I met there, and for their time in showing me their work. I also had the opportunity to speak with representatives from Oklo, a company working on new forms of nuclear power, including recycling nuclear waste as fuel. One of the best parts of making Huge If True is meeting and learning from people pushing what we can do in the hopes of improving the world for everyone else.\n\nChapters: \n00:00 Nuclear waste isn’t what I thought\n02:21 How I got obsessed\n03:27 How much energy is in nuclear waste?\n05:31 Thank you Storyblocks!\n06:20 How do you get electricity?\n06:50 What is uranium?\n07:28 How does a nuclear reaction work?\n08:05 Why is nuclear waste dangerous?\n08:40 What do we do with nuclear waste?\n09:35 How do you make electricity from nuclear waste?\n11:21 Why doesn’t the US reuse nuclear fuel?\n12:20 Is recycling waste feasible?\n13:41 What is Huge If True?\n\nCorrections:\n07:09 The number refers to the total number of nucleons (either a proton or a neutron) in the atom, not the neutrons alone. A U-235 atom contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons (an atomic mass of 235). The U-238 atom also has 92 protons but has 146 neutrons (an atomic mass of 238). I should have said these *differ* by the number of neutrons in the atom.

{"description":"Oppenheimer - Only In Theaters 7 21 23\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. \n \nThe film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. Oscar® winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award® nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar® winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar® nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\nOppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography. \n\nNolan’s films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations. \n\nSocial Handles:\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/oppenheimermovie    \nTW: https://www.twitter.com/@oppenheimerfilm  \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OppenheimerMovie \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/OppenheimerMovie/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/oppenheimermovie\nWebsite: https://www.OppenheimerMovie.com   \n#Oppenheimer","title":"Oppenheimer | New Trailer","duration":187,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230508","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYPbbksJxIg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uYPbbksJxIg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":16419490}}

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to our next installment of our nordic/Scandinavian travel trip! After taking a warm bath in the Blue Lagoon in Iceland - I thought - let’s chill out a bit - literally - and head to the original Ice Hotel in Northern Sweden! Yes, this hotel is made completely out of ice and snow, and it melts and gets rebuilt every year - and yes, people actually sleep in here!! I'm very interested by **strange hotels** and after our trip to the Underwater Hotel last year, when I heard of the ICEHOTEL - I figured, we better check it out. So, after a brief moment being stuck in Iceland, we headed to the ICEHOTEL to investigate & spend the night - and hopefully not get cryogenically frozen like Walt Disney's head. What do you guys think?? Would you stay here? Where should we go next?\n\nAlso - to add on to our disclaimer in the video - \"Lapland\" is not a technically a shared region, it's a general region that spans across a few different countries! \nhttps://scandification.com/where-is-lapland/\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nMelissa Douglas\nBree von Bradsky\nAndrew Lainhart\nPhil Kinney\nElizabeth Pinotti\nIshara Mathews\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS: \n0:00 Intro\n1:56 Stuck In Iceland\n5:20 A Day in Stockholm\n6:55 Traveling to the Ice Hotel\n7:52 Other (Not Icy) Buildings at the Ice Hotel\n9:33 Finally, The Ice Hotel Itself\n10:39 Ice Hotel Room Tours\n14:02 Why does this thing exist?\n16:48 Ice Hotel 365\n18:46 Other Stuff to do at the Ice Hotel\n20:03 Eating the Ice Menu\n21:11 Our (ice) room\n22:49 How to sleep in an ice room\n24:37 Goodnight\n26:13 Good Morning\n27:47 Carve that Ice!\n28:41 Outro\n\n#travel #vlog #hotel","title":"I Spent 24 Hours In An Ice Hotel","duration":1793,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230507","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfQOsKmyCNY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/KfQOsKmyCNY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1653317}}

Thanks to AG1 for sponsoring Click here: https://athleticgreens.com/tylerandtodd to get up to a year's supply of immune supporting Vitamin D + 5 individual travel packs, both FREE with your first purchase! \n\nThe idea to build a shipping container home was definitely one of the wildest ones we've had and if you've been joining our weekly videos for any amount of time you know that's saying something. It feels absolutely incredible that the container home FINALLY has a consistent and reliable source of heat...just in time for the holidays!

Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future.

{"description":"Long Live the Fighters. #DunePartTwo only in theaters November 3.\n\n-----------------\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dune\nhttps://twitter.com/dunemovie \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@dunemovie \n-----------------\nThe saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast.  The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).\n“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. \nVilleneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel.  The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick.  The executive producers are Josh Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.\nVilleneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West.  Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.\n“Dune: Part Two” was filmed on location in Budapest, Abu Dhabi, Jordan and Italy.  The film is slated for a November 3, 2023 worldwide release from Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Dune: Part Two | Official Trailer","duration":144,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

Then finally I recycled old slag to see if it would produce any more iron.\n\nThe first way was to roast the ore before smelting. This drove off the moisture and volatiles in the ore as well as burning off any sulfur present. The resulting ore produced a higher yield of iron than normal (33g iron as opposed to about 15g iron as usual for the same volume of ore, charcoal and time). \n\nNext lime was added to the smelt as a flux in the form of snail shells. The theory was that the lime would lower the melting point of any silica in the ore to make a runnier slag and help the iron come together more. The result was very bad, no iron was produced apart from 1 or 2 prills. I suspect the ore is already basic in chemistry and adding a basic flux in the form of lime made it so basic that the slag was too viscous. The ore probably won't benefit from a basic flux but might benefit from an acid flux such as sand or slag from previous smelts.\n\nNext I tried smelting slag from previous smelts to see if anymore iron would come out. It did surprisingly, less than fresh ore but still worth doing. For this reason it might be useful to add old slag as a flux to future smelts to help the slag form more easily, while contributing some more iron to the smelt.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

It’ll be hard for us to go wrong taste-wise, but how GOOD can we get them to look? Can we match those eye catching thumbnails? We'll have to find out! \n\nps - we did have some technical difficulties with our audio during our second sandwich - it sounds a little tin-y, so if you notice it, it's not just you! sorry about that! \n\nYou can check out our merch here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nProduced & Edited by\nCarly Dawson\nNez Covington\nTyler Williams\nSafiya Nygaard\nAlaina Simmons\nHailey Cox\n\nGFX by\nDayana Espinoza\nElizabeth Pinotti\nCarly Dawson\n\nMUSIC\nVia Audio Network","title":"We Tried Making Japanese Aesthetic Sandwiches","duration":1454,"channel_id":"UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw","author":"Tyler Williams","date":"20230504","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbxHATiIfUQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EbxHATiIfUQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":737354}}
