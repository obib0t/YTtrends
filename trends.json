{"description":"Watch and you'll see, some day I'll be, part of your world! Watch the new trailer for #TheLittleMermaid and see the movie in theaters May 26!\n\nThe brand new soundtrack for Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” is available now to Pre-Save, Pre-Add or Pre-Order – https://presave.umusic.com/thelittlemermaidsoundtrack\n\n“The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) as the voice of Sebastian; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca”) as the voice of Flounder; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      \n \n“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”) with a screenplay by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”). The songs feature music from multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”) and lyrics by Howard Ashman, and new lyrics by three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), Miranda, two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), and Rob Marshall, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. \n\nHashtag: #TheLittleMermaid\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/littlemermaid\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyTheLittleMermaid\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneylittlemermaid/","title":"The Little Mermaid | Official Trailer","duration":141,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpGo2_d3oYE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kpGo2_d3oYE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":7793399}}

Certain Pokémon-ex also include a new Terastal mechanic that works similarly to Ancient Traits.\n\nReleasing on the same day in Japan will be the three ex Starter Sets, each starring one Pokémon-ex and one of the Paldean starter Pokémon.

{"description":"Governments are rushing to reassure citizens that their money is safe, after the US saw its biggest banking collapse since the global financial crisis. Silicon Valley Bank's demise was closely followed by that of New York-based Signature Bank. The US insists a repeat of 2008 is not on the cards - but how contagious could the problems be?\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg released a joint statement Sunday that they will complete the resolution of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) whilst protecting depositors.\n\n\"Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThe reason authorities believe the taxpayer will incur no cost is that authorities administrating the bank will be able to use its remaining assets to cover the costs of reimbursing depositors.\n\nThe same will also apply to Signature Bank. On Sunday, the New York State Chartering Authority closed down the cryptocurrency-exposed lender that had lost around a third of its share price value in the second half of the week. \n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters on Sunday that he would speak at more length on the issue early on Monday.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#US #bankfailure #USregulators","title":"As another bank collapses, US regulators race to prevent spread of crisis I DW News","duration":475,"channel_id":"UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg","author":"DW News","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0Ilm230bf8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a0Ilm230bf8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":922061}}

First up though I wanna thank everyone for rocking with me the last 9 weeks and we're sort of like Joel and Ellie a bit because I'd doom the entire human race just to get a thumbs up from you.\n\nAnyway we start off the episode with a flashback and this features a major game cameo. Out in the woods we join a pregnant woman running and this is none other than Ashley Johnson. Ashley voiced Ellie in the game and here we catch her playing her mother. So far several big actors from the game have popped up including Tommy's voice actor as Perry, Troy Baker as James last week and Marlene's who shows up later on in this scene.\n\nEllies mother is called Anna and she was first mentioned in the last of us comic American Dreams.\n\nThis featured Ellie and Riley and in it we learned a little bit about Anna and what she did before the outbreak.\n\nAnna worked as a nurse before the outbreak and we know that she and her lifelong friend Marlene survived together when everything went down worse than this channels views next week.\n\nAll that we learned from the backstroy was that she died within a day of giving birth to Ellie but here we see it fleshed out with her running to a farmhouse being chased by an infected person. We can see a big symbol for the fireflies denoting that this is a safehouse and you can also catch what I'm guessing is the Boston QZ in the background. As we know this was controlled by Fedra and though we don't learn why Anna's out on her own like this it likely has something to do with the infected.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":3025,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2-Egs56y_I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2-Egs56y_I/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":352305}}

{"description":"PRESS START. The final #SuperMarioMovie trailer is here! Tickets on sale now: https://uni.pictures/SMBGetTickets\n--\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\nOnly In Theaters April 5, 2023\n\nFacebook: https://uni.pictures/SMBFB\nTwitter: https://uni.pictures/SMBTW\nInstagram: https://uni.pictures/SMBIG\nTikTok: https://uni.pictures/SMBTT\nSite: https://uni.pictures/SMBSite\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/illuminationent\nhttps://www.facebook.com/illuminationent\nhttps://twitter.com/illumination\n--\n\nFor the first time, the iconic global entertainment brands Illumination and Nintendo join forces to create The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a new, big-screen adventure starring one of pop culture’s most prominent plumbers of the past four decades.\n\nBased on the world of Nintendo’s Mario games, the film invites audiences into a vibrant, thrilling new universe unlike any created before in an action-packed, exuberant cinematic comedy event. \n\nWhile working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt; Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi. \n\nWith the assistance of a Mushroom Kingdom resident Toad (Keegan-Michael Key; The Lion King) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy;The Queen’s Gambit), Mario taps into his own power. \n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an extraordinary comedic cast, including Jack Black (Jumanji films) as Bowser, Seth Rogen (Neighbors franchise) as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen (Portlandia, Saturday Night Live) as Cranky Kong, Kevin Michael Richardson (American Dad!, Family Guy) as Kamek and Sebastian Maniscalco (Green Book) as Spike, plus a special voice appearance by Charles Martinet, who has voiced the characters of Mario and Luigi in the Super Mario games for more than 30 years.\n\nThe film is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (collaborators on Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part). \n\nFrom Nintendo and Illumination—creator of the global blockbuster Despicable Me, Minions, Sing and The Secret Life of Pets franchises—The Super Mario Bros. Movie is produced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri p.g.a. and by Nintendo’s Representative Director and Fellow Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario, after more than six years of close bond and discussions between the two. The film is co-financed by Universal Pictures and Nintendo and will be released worldwide by Universal Pictures.","title":"The Super Mario Bros.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #TearItDown #Recovery","title":"Quando Rondo - Tear It Down [Official Music Video]","duration":198,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20230309","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRWPouGltM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2QRWPouGltM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":814171}}
