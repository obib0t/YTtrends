{"description":"Out of the sea, wish I could be... part of that world.\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall‚Äôs live-action reimagining of the studio‚Äôs Oscar¬Æ-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton‚Äôs daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life ‚Äì and her father‚Äôs crown ‚Äì in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (‚Äúgrown-ish‚Äù) as Ariel; Tony Award¬Æ winner Daveed Diggs (‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù ‚ÄúSnowpiercer‚Äù) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (‚ÄúLuca,‚Äù ‚ÄúRoom‚Äù) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (‚ÄúRaya and the Last Dragon‚Äù) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (‚ÄúA Dog‚Äôs Way Home‚Äù) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (‚ÄúHomeland‚Äù) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù) as Queen Selina; with Oscar¬Æ winner Javier Bardem (‚ÄúNo Country for Old Men,‚Äù ‚ÄúBeing the Ricardos‚Äù) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award¬Æ nominee Melissa McCarthy (‚ÄúCan You Ever Forgive Me?‚Äù ‚ÄúBridesmaids‚Äù) as Ursula.      \n\n‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù is directed by Oscar¬Æ nominee Rob Marshall (‚ÄúChicago,‚Äù ‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (‚ÄúLife of Pi,‚Äù ‚ÄúFinding Neverland‚Äù), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (‚ÄúTony Bennett: An American Classic‚Äù), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy¬Æ winner Marc Platt (‚ÄúJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,‚Äù ‚ÄúGrease Live!‚Äù), three-time Tony Award¬Æ winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award¬Æ winner Alan Menken (‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin‚Äù), who won two Oscars¬Æ for the music in the animated version of ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns,‚Äù ‚ÄúInto the Woods‚Äù).

{"description":"The magical teaser trailer for the all-new live-action musical comedy ‚ÄúDisenchanted,‚Äù which premiered at the D23 Expo 2022 in the Anaheim Convention Center moments ago, is here! The eagerly-anticipated sequel to ‚ÄúEnchanted,‚Äù which reunites original cast members Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel, and James Marsden and also stars Maya Rudolph, Gabriella Baldacchino, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Jayma Mays, is directed by Adam Shankman and features new songs from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. ‚ÄúDisenchanted‚Äù begins streaming November 24, exclusively on Disney+‚Ä¶just in time to brighten up the holiday season.\n \n\nIt has been 15 years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) wed, but Giselle has grown disillusioned with life in the city, so they move their growing family to the sleepy suburban community of Monroeville in search of a more fairy tale life. Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn‚Äôt been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family‚Äôs future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.\n\n\n‚ÄúDisenchanted stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Gabriella Baldacchino, with Idina Menzel and James Marsden.

{"description":"Please consider supporting me at https://www.patreon.com/LindsayHoliday\n\nThe United Kingdom has a new King. On September 8th, 2022, at the moment of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs death, Charles, as her eldest son and heir apparent, acceded the throne and became King. Within hours it was announced that he would reign under the regnal name of Charles III, ending years of speculation that he might choose a different moniker, possible that hos his Grandfather, George. Another matter of contention was the title his wife, Camilla would use. That too was cleared up when it was confirmed that she will be Queen Consort. In fact she is England‚Äôs first commoner queen consort in 475 years, since Henry VIII died in 1547 and his final wife, Catherine Parr was downgraded to Queen dowager. \rOn the September 10th the accession council meet at St. James‚Äôs Palace, as they have since the 1603 to declare Charles King. More about that later. However you may feel about Charles personally or the Monarchy in general, he is the modern link in a chain going back a thousand years. Let‚Äôs take a look at the fascinating, often controversial lives of the new King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms. \n\nCheck out the History Tea Time Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7iW8gOI5wb5TNFAIhBd9Om?si=46aeeacd64214ac0\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/history-tea-time/id1619978406\nGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy84Yzg1ZWU5MC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw\n\nMusic: Brandenburg Concerto No4-1 BWV1049 - Classical Whimsical by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100303\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nFor business inquiries, please contact LindsayHoliday@ellify.com","title":"King Charles III & Queen Camilla","duration":1227,"channel_id":"UCUsJAAPcT5T_hoSXdNfOP4Q","author":"History Tea Time with Lindsay Holiday","date":"20220910","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHm5duwNPHs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aHm5duwNPHs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1580677}}

{"description":"Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nShe became Queen in 1952 at the age of 25 and spent 70 years on the throne. She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \"it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \"rock\".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign.","title":"Queen Elizabeth II dies aged 96","duration":1369,"channel_id":"UCTrQ7HXWRRxr7OsOtodr2_w","author":"Channel 4 News","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYGByWrjyFw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mYGByWrjyFw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4898836}}

{"description":"In memoriam Queen Elizabeth II\n\n[This documentary was originally released in April 2022]\n\nOn February 6, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 70th anniversary on the throne. No other head of state has been in power for so long. This film analyzes the fascinating relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers.\n\nWinston Churchill was in love with his young queen. The relationship with Margaret Thatcher was difficult. Then there‚Äôs Brexiteer Boris Johnson - this film illuminates the very different relationships Queen Elizabeth has had with the many prime ministers who have served during her long reign. \n\nFilmmakers Katharina Wolff and Larissa Klinker examine Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs role as the symbol of a centuries-old power structure in the United Kingdom. Although the British monarch has no direct political power, the prime minister travels from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace every week for a private audience. \n\nIn this film, personal secretaries, political experts and Buckingham Palace insiders reveal what is discussed at these private meetings and how much impact personalities have on the relationship between royalty and the government.\n\nUsing archival footage and personal accounts, the film shows how the queen accompanied her prime ministers through their time in office. On September 6, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Liz Truss as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #QueenElizabeth \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

{"description":"Bobby Carter | September 8, 2022\nEverything JID does is intricately detailed. He seems to care much more than the average emcee, and throughout this entire production, I felt his strong desire to get it right. The weight was lifted from his shoulders at the midway point of the set as he turned to his band, saying, \"We're pretty hot guys. We're pretty f***ing hot.\" In this performance, recorded weeks before the release of his now widely praised third studio album, The Forever Story, the East Atlanta native performs songs from the album live for the first time, plus career-defining songs in ways we've never heard before.\n\nThe origin of JID makes up the puzzle pieces in The Forever Story. It's the story of a kid with derailed football dreams, searching for purpose until it found him. These are tales that many kids from the inner city can relate to ‚Äî but what sets JID's story apart is that nobody raps like him. His music casts a wide net, considering history, family and hometown, and connecting with hip-hop enthusiasts and music nerds alike.\n\nIn these stripped-down versions of songs like \"Never\" and \"Surround Sound,\" the focus is on how JID can manipulate pitch, bend words and hop from one cadence to another. After he playfully cuts the \"Usher tension,\" he and his stacked band and backup singers close with the powerful and spiritual \"Kody Blu 31.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Galaxy\"\n\"Workin Out\"\n\"Off da Zoinkys\"\n\"Never\"\n\"Sistanem\"\n\"Surround Sound\"\n\"Kody Blu 31\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJID: vocals\nNajinga Luster: vocals\nRashida Chitunda: vocals\nTeja Lanier Veal: bass\nGrady Housworth: trombone\nAllan Knighton: saxophone\nMichael Cruse: trumpet\nSamuel Williams: keys\nDivante Davis: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Alant√© Serene\nAudio Assistant: Andie Huether\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #JID","title":"JID: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1323,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsaZRcL-OTQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gsaZRcL-OTQ/hqdefault.webp?v=63191459","content":{"View count":910195}}

Flynne is smart, ambitious, and doomed.  She has no future. Until the future comes calling for her. The Peripheral is master storyteller William Gibson‚Äôs dazzling, hallucinatory glimpse into the fate of mankind ‚Äî and what lies beyond.  \n\nFlynne Fisher lives in the rural American South, working at the local 3D printing shop, while earning much needed extra money playing VR games for rich people.  One night she dons a headset and finds herself in futuristic London‚Äîa sleek and mysterious world, alluringly different from her own hardscrabble existence.  \nBut this isn‚Äôt like any game she‚Äôs ever played before:  Flynne begins to realize it isn‚Äôt virtual reality‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs real.  Someone in London, seventy years in the future, has found a way to open a door to Flynne‚Äôs world.  And as utterly beguiling as London is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs also dangerous.  As Flynne searches to discover who has connected their worlds, and for what purpose, her presence here sets dangerous forces into motion‚Ä¶forces intent on destroying Flynne and her family in her own world.","title":"The Peripheral Season 1 - Teaser Trailer | Prime Video","duration":110,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSaWHbCSmRI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RSaWHbCSmRI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5841122}}

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet¬≠to¬≠be¬≠dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #BloxFruits","title":"üêâ Cursed Dual Katana Puzzle Location | Blox Fruits","duration":94,"channel_id":"UCH-hRvGG-A2zQDDPF-kIDpA","author":"Axiore","date":"20220911","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FeYdnfPJxI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4FeYdnfPJxI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":451473}}

{"description":"A beautifully crafted story of forbidden love and changing social conventions, My Policeman follows three young people - policeman Tom (Harry Styles), teacher Marion (Emma Corrin) and museum curator Patrick (David Dawson) as they embark on an emotional journey in 1950s Britain. Flashing forward to the 1990s, Tom (Linus Roache), Marion (Gina McKee) and Patrick (Rupert Everett) are still reeling with longing and regret, but now they have one last chance to repair the damage of the past. Based on the book by Bethan Roberts, director Michael Grandage carves a visually transporting, heart-stopping portrait of three people caught up in the shifting tides of history, liberty, and forgiveness.\n\n¬ª SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

{"description":"TULSA KING follows New York mafia capo Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone), just after he is released from prison after 25 years and unceremoniously exiled by his boss to set up shop in Tulsa, Okla. Realizing that his mob family may not have his best interests in mind, Dwight slowly builds a \"crew\" from a group of unlikely characters, to help him establish a new criminal empire in a place that to him might as well be another planet. The series also stars Andrea Savage (\"I'm Sorry\"), Martin Starr (\"Silicon Valley\"), Max Casella (\"The Tender Bar\"), Domenick Lombardozzi (\"The Irishman\"), Vincent Piazza (\"Boardwalk Empire\"), Jay Will (\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\"), A.C. Peterson (\"Superman & Lois\") with Garrett Hedlund (\"The United States vs. Billie Holiday\").\n\nThe series will be executive-produced by Sheridan, Winter, Stallone, David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin and Allen Coulter. Braden Aftergood is also set to executive-produce. \n\nStream the new series on November 13, exclusively on Paramount+. \n\nTry It Free: https://bit.ly/3O3agnD \n\nFollow Paramount+ for the latest news:\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/ParamountPlus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/paramountplus \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/paramountplus/","title":"Tulsa King | Teaser Trailer | Paramount+","duration":90,"channel_id":"UCrRttZIypNTA1Mrfwo745Sg","author":"Paramount Plus","date":"20220907","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXd3tO5ITyw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PXd3tO5ITyw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4080631}}
