When the Demeter finally arrives off the shores of England, it is a charred, derelict wreck. There is no trace of the crew.  \n \nThe film stars Corey Hawkins (In the Heights, Straight Outta Compton) as Clemens, a doctor who joins the Demeter crew, Aisling Franciosi (Game of Thrones, The Nightingale) as an unwitting stowaway, Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans) as the ship’s captain and David Dastmalchian (Dune, the Ant-Man franchise) as the Demeter’s first mate. \n \nThe film also features Jon Jon Briones (Ratched, American Horror Story), Stefan Kapicic (Deadpool films, Better Call Saul), Nikolai Nikolaeff (Stranger Things, Bruised) and Javier Botet (It films, Mama).\n \nFrom DreamWorks Pictures and the producers of Zodiac and Black Swan, The Last Voyage of the Demeter is directed by Norwegian horror virtuoso André Øvredal (Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark, Trollhunter), from a script by Bragi F. Schut (Escape Room), Stefan Ruzowitzky (The Counterfeiters) and Zak Olkewicz (the upcoming Bullet Train), based on the chapter “The Captain’s Log” of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. \n \nThe film is produced by Brad Fischer and by Oscar®-nominated producer Mike Medavoy and Arnold Messer for Phoenix Pictures and is executive produced by Matthew Hirsch.","title":"The Last Voyage of the Demeter | Official Trailer","duration":155,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230413","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FgUUO9Ztd0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6FgUUO9Ztd0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":496165}}

{"description":"Today AD is welcomed by Troian Bellisario and Patrick J. Adams for a tour of their 1924 Spanish Colonial Revival home in Los Angeles. Designed by one of the lions of the golden age of California architecture, Wallace Neff, its white stucco exterior, colorfully tiled main staircase, and wrought-iron details are all calling cards of his numerous Spanish-influenced homes. The actors and homeowners—Adams is best known for his role on _Suits_ in which he played Meghan Markle’s character’s love interest, while Bellisario starred on the popular teen drama _Pretty Little Liars_ —fell in love with the residence while in the midst of planning their 2016 wedding and moved in right after their honeymoon, embarking on renovations a few years later with designer Rosa Beltran. “The goal was to make it feel how Neff and the team of artisans who had worked on the home in the beginning would have wanted it to feel, and also to make it really comfortable and useful for a modern-day family,” says Beltran.\r\n\r\nSee more from Troian and Patrick's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/tour-troian-bellisario-and-patrick-j-adamss-eclectic-spanish-colonial-revival-home\r\n\r\nShop Troian and Patrick’s home style!\r\n\r\n*Lighting* \r\n(Similar) Etsy Mid Century Wall Sconce: https://fave.co/3KEK8j0\r\nWest Elm Metalized Glass USB Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3zUiucM\r\n(Similar) Boost Area Floor Lamp: https://amzn.to/3GDAU56\r\nWest Elm Caldas Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3MEJ6Gi\r\nLumens Currey & Company Nottaway Chandelier: https://fave.co/41mo2Z5\r\nJWDA Table Lamp: https://fave.co/41j5xp3\r\n(Similar) Etsy Moroccan Handmade Lamp: https://fave.co/3zYR5Gk\r\n\r\n*Accessories*\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Clay Planter: https://fave.co/3MEEShU\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Kilim Lumbar Pillows: https://fave.co/3KwMLmO\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Aqua Glass Mannequin Head: https://fave.co/411ip2B\r\n(Similar) Etsy Framed Blue Papilio Ulysses Butterfly: https://fave.co/4051Fqf\r\n(Similar) Etsy Los Angeles Highway Print: https://fave.co/3Kv9bF6\r\nOur Place Always Pan: https://fave.co/3KRY4az\r\n(Similar) Etsy Large Vintage Cutting Board: https://fave.co/41FKT2b\r\nAarke Carbonator: https://amzn.to/3KEPN8K\r\n(Similar) Etsy Greek God Head Planter: https://fave.co/410ZZPR\r\nDS & Durga Bowmakers Perfume: https://fave.co/41sf78F\r\nAesop Hand Soap: https://fave.co/401RX80\r\nEveryday Oil: https://amzn.to/3MEUYbd\r\nChemex Pour Over Coffee Maker: https://amzn.to/3GCHOrk\r\n(Similar) Revival Rugs Aritomo Vintage Turkish Rug: https://fave.co/3KurF8B\r\n\r\n*Furniture*\r\n(Similar) Glitzhome Terrazzo Plant Stand: https://fave.co/3GCURci\r\n(Similar) Chairish Rustic Elm Console Table: https://fave.co/3GBW4Aw\r\n(Similar) CB2 Flynn Velvet Ottoman: https://fave.co/411NlA4\r\n(Similar) Amazon Wood Barstool: https://amzn.to/404mRwg\r\n(Similar) Anthropologie Wallace Cane and Oak Sideboard: https://fave.co/3KSfmo2\r\n(Similar) Wayfair Leather Conference Chair: https://fave.co/3KAFsKC\r\n(Similar) Sundays Coastline Ottoman: https://fave.co/414PUkT\r\n(Similar) Article Sven Sofa: https://fave.co/409m2Cl\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nArtwork By: \r\nEdward Burtynsky https://www.edwardburtynsky.com/ \r\nLorien Haynes https://www.lorienhaynes.com/artist-work \r\nAndric Ljubodrag https://www.ljubodrag-andric.com/ \r\nKeita Morimoto https://www.keitamorimoto.com/ \r\nPat Perry https://patperry.net/art/paintings\r\nLindsay Ross https://www.lindseyrossphoto.com/about\r\nMax Wagner https://www.maxwanger.com/\r\n\r\nDirector: Winter Dunn\r\nDirector of Photography: AJ Young\r\nEditor: Ron Douglas\r\nTalent: Patrick Adams, Troian Bellisario\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nLine Producer: Joe Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Josh Crowe\r\nProduction Manager: Peter Brunette\r\nEquipment Manager: Kevin Balash\r\nCamera Operator: Josh Anderson\r\nAudio: Gray Thomas-Sowers\r\nProduction Assistant: Fernando Barajas\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague \r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nTalent Booker: Luke Leifeste\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nJunior Editor: Paul Tael\r\nAssistant Editor: Justin Symonds\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.\"","title":"Take a Break: Kardashian-Jenner Momager","duration":769,"channel_id":"UCJ0uqCI0Vqr2Rrt1HseGirg","author":"The Late Late Show with James Corden","date":"20230412","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6V5rlWZ9Zk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r6V5rlWZ9Zk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":849173}}

{"description":"Teresa Xie | April 10, 2023\nWhen Fred again.. first proposed a Tiny Desk concert, it wasn't immediately clear how he was going to make it work — not because he lacked creativity, but because translating purely electronic music at the Desk is a daunting task for anyone. How would an artist, whose performances take the form of DJ sets in front of massive audiences, curate an intimate and unique experience? But what the British songwriter and producer came up with is a reminder of what a Tiny Desk is at its best: an opportunity for artists to challenge themselves in such a way that it almost feels like they're making new music, all while sticking to what feels true to them. For Fred again.. that meant re-learning the marimba, playing the vibraphone, singing at the piano and looping sounds and beats — all at the same time. He began his set with \"Kyle (i found you),\" recreating the song's melody on the marimba while clips of featured poet Kyle \"Guante\" Tran Myhre reciting the work \"Love In The Time of Undeath\" appeared on-screen. Sitting at the piano, he faded the remnants of \"Kyle (i found you)\" into \"Roze (forgive),\" which features Fred again.. triggering vocals sampled from the artist I am Roze, whose powerful facial expressions were magnified on a screen.In a surprising pivot, the primary vocals on the following track, \"Me (heavy),\" came from Fred again.. himself, with no manipulation, creating a vulnerable sense of intimacy in the space. A flurry of looped piano keys marked the transition to \"Delilah (pull me out of this),\" with guest vocals pulled from pop singer Delilah Montagu's 2021 track \"Lost Keys.\" By his set's end, concluding with \"Faisal (envelops me),\" Fred again.. was back at the piano finally resting after moving seamlessly through a jam-packed Tiny Desk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Kyle (i found you)\"\n\"Roze (forgive)\"\n\"Adam (interlude)\"\n\"Me (heavy)\"\n\"Berwyn (interlude)\"\n\"Delilah (pull me out of this)\"\n\"Faisal (envelops me)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nFred again..: vocals, piano, vibraphone, marimba, electronics\nSpecial thanks to: Guante, I Am Roze (they/them), Aminé, Delilah Montagu, Berwyn, Faisal, Lucy Hickling, Gareth Nunns, Jamie Tinsley, Tony Friend, Tobias Miorin \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Sofia Seidel \nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Sofia Seidel, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant \nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galván, Teresa Xie\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #fredagain","title":"Fred again..: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1604,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230410","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQmPv_dTI0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4iQmPv_dTI0/hqdefault.jpg?v=643085c1","content":{"View count":1343831}}
