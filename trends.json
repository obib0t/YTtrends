{"description":"This Summer, meet the residents of Element City\n\nWatch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s #Elemental and see the movie in 3D, only in theaters June 16!\n\nCheck out a brand-new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental,” an all-new original feature film that transports moviegoers to an extraordinary place called Element City, where a host of elements live and work. The trailer showcases each element—air, earth, water and fire—and what sets them apart according to Ember, a quick-witted and fiery woman who’s always stayed close to home in Firetown. In “Elemental,” which opens in theaters on June 16, she finally ventures out of her comfort zone to explore this spectacular world born from the imaginations of Pixar’s filmmakers and specifically crafted for the big-screen experience. Element City is inspired by big cities around the globe and embraces theorized contributions from each elemental community—from giant pine-tree-like buildings and waterfall skyscrapers to a tornado-shaped arena called Cyclone Stadium. \n\nJoining the previously announced voice cast including Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as Ember and Wade, respectively, are Ronnie del Carmen as Ember’s soon-to-be retired dad, Bernie; Shila Ommi as Ember’s love-seeking mom, Cinder; Wendi McLendon-Covey as Wade’s stormy and Air-Ball-loving boss, Gale; Catherine O’Hara as Wade’s welcoming mom, Brook; Mason Wertheimer as Ember’s admiring earth neighbor, Clod; and Joe Pera as an overgrown city bureaucrat, Fern.\n \nDirected by Peter Sohn, produced by Denise Ream, p.g.a., and executive produced by Pete Docter, “Elemental” features a screenplay by John Hoberg & Kat Likkel and Brenda Hsueh with story by Sohn, Hoberg & Likkel and Hsueh. The film’s original score was composed and conducted by Thomas Newman. \n\r\nPixar Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixar/\r\nPixar Twitter: https://twitter.com/pixar\r\nPixar Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pixar\r\n \r\nCopyright: (C) Disney•Pixar","title":"Elemental | Official Trailer","duration":139,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20230328","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXzcyx9V0xw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hXzcyx9V0xw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5063717}}

{"description":"Trolls Band Together - In Theaters this Fall\n\nThis holiday season, get ready for an action-packed, all-star, rainbow-colored family reunion like no other as Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake return for the new chapter in DreamWorks Animation’s blockbuster musical franchise: Trolls Band Together. \n\nAfter two films of true friendship and relentless flirting, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) are now officially, finally, a couple (#broppy)! As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past. He was once part of her favorite boyband phenomenon, BroZone, with his four brothers: Floyd (Golden Globe nominated electropop sensation Troye Sivan), John Dory (Eric André; Sing 2), Spruce (Grammy winner Daveed Diggs; Hamilton) and Clay (Grammy winner Kid Cudi; Don’t Look Up). BroZone disbanded when Branch was still a baby, as did the family, and Branch hasn’t seen his brothers since.  \n\nBut when Branch’s bro Floyd is kidnapped for his musical talents by a pair of nefarious pop-star villains—Velvet (Emmy winner Amy Schumer; Trainwreck) and Veneer (Grammy winner and Tony nominee Andrew Rannells; The Book of Mormon)—Branch and Poppy embark on a harrowing and emotional journey to reunite the other brothers and rescue Floyd from a fate even worse than pop-culture obscurity. \n\nFeaturing Trolls’ signature psychedelic joy-bomb of new and classic pop hits, Trolls Band Together stars a dazzling cast of musical superstars and comedic powerhouses as new franchise characters, including four-time Grammy nominee and Latin Grammy winner Camila Cabello (Cinderella) as Viva; Zosia Mamet (The Flight Attendant) as Crimp; and 12-time Emmy winning drag icon RuPaul Charles as Miss Maxine. \n\nThe returning cast includes Grammy, Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Zooey Deschanel as Bridget; Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Gristle, the Icona Pop duo Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt as Satin and Chenille, Grammy winner Anderson .Paak as Prince D, comedian Ron Funches as Cooper, SAG nominee Kunal Nayyar as Guy Diamond and Emmy winning Saturday Night Live legend Kenan Thompson as Tiny Diamond. \n\nTrolls Band Together is steered by returning director Walt Dohrn and producer Gina Shay, and is co-directed by Tim Heitz (head of story, Trolls World Tour). DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls films—2016’s Trolls and 2020’s Trolls World Tour—have sung and danced their way to record-breaking success, earning an Oscar® nomination for Best Original Song and fueling one of the largest and most beloved entertainment brands in the world.\n\nSocial:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DreamWorksTrolls   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/trolls \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/trolls \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@trolls \nWebsite: http://www.trollsmovie.com/  \n#TrollsBandTogether\n\nPre-save to be the first to hear music from the movie! https://www.trollssoundtrack.com/","title":"TROLLS BAND TOGETHER | Official Trailer","duration":138,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230328","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ40Z62tcXM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qZ40Z62tcXM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":809113}}

{"description":"Watch the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor celebrating Adam Sandler on CNN.com or CNNgo.\n\nhttps://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nThe Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, was awarded to Adam Sandler at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy -- including Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Ben Stiller, Dana Carvey, Pete Davidson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Anniston, Idina Menzel, David Spade, and more -- on March 19, 2023, and aired nationally on CNN on March 26, 2023.\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\n“Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,” said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to bring together the best in comedy.”\n\n#MarkTwainPrize #AdamSandler #kennedycenter #cnn \n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Adam Sandler Acceptance Speech | 2023 Mark Twain Prize","duration":692,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20230327","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CukbxgucLc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5CukbxgucLc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1939459}}

{"description":"Stacie shares her experience with tiny house living, including some important lessons learned about designing, financing, and finding a parking spot for a tiny house, all from the perspective of a former apartment dweller in the city who made the leap to move to a tiny home in a rural mobile home park.\n\nYou can follow and find out more about Stacie's tiny home experience here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@CasaDuroTinyHome\n\nStacie had her home custom-built and was able to pay a deposit and obtain a line of credit to cover the remainder of the cost.  In the video, she suggests saving in advance if possible, and she also mentions chattel loans, builder financing, and financing from the previous owner as other financial loan options to explore (since many lending institutions and banks might not issue a conventional mortgage for a tiny house on wheels).\n\nFor parking, Stacie wanted a legal setup and spent a lot of time following leads for parking her home on private land, but they often fell through because the municipality wouldn't approve it, or because the landowners changed their minds.  At the last minute, she was able to find a spot to park it at a trailer park.  Since moving there she's had the chance to visit neighbouring trailers and wishes she had checked them out as an option before having a tiny home custom-built.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.

If these meetings are interrupted, I may lose out on getting our Spy Ninjas Toys in Target stores as well as lose our 2nd graphic novel. Vy and Daniel surprised me with balloons, streamers, a birthday cake, and Spider-man, when I returned home from cancer treatment (radiation). I was really happy and thanked them, but I told them that I can't have any more interruptions. I was about to start my phone call with Scholastic but suddenly a gorilla showed up in my backyard. He sang me happy birthday, told a number of cringy monkey jokes and was on his way. Later, in the middle of my meeting with Target, a donkey walked into my yard! I had to cut my meeting short and go outside to play with the donkey.

{"description":"Spain and Norway faced off in their qualification match for the 2024 Euro. Spain took control of the pitch early on in the match. Dani Olmo scored the first goal for Spain with a flawless shot to the bottom tight corner assisted by Alejandro Balde. Norway wanted vengeance and had some great chances. After lots of back-and-forth chances, Joselu scored with a beautiful header into the left corner to extend Spain’s lead to 2-0 in his debut game. A minute later, Joselu scored again with a left-footed shot to the bottom right corner to extend Spain’s lead 3-0.

He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\n\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #Recovery #WhereWouldIBe","title":"Quando Rondo - Where Would I Be [Official Music Video]","duration":123,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20230323","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDVzUvmZaA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PDDVzUvmZaA/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":510639}}

{"description":"Italy and England begun their qualification journey to the 2024 Euros with an entertaining matchup! England jumped to a hot start in the first half and didn't look back, highlighted from goals by Declan Rica and Harry Kane. With his 54th goal in international competition, Kane become the record goal scorer for England. Italy failed to make much of a mark in the first half, but was able to change this during the second half. Featuring a pass from Lorenzo Pellegrini, Mateo Retegui slotted a beautiful strike to grab his first goal in his debut match.  Italy continued to press, looking for that second goal to tie the match, but England was able to hold on to a 2-1 victory for the first time since 1961 at Italy. \n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #England\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

We explore that using numbers generated from our last episode, where the Z06 beat a Porsche 911 GT3 (992), an Audi R8 V10 Performance, and almost kept up with a Ducati Panigale V4 SP2.\n\nUsing his signature time-freeze technique, veteran automotive journalist Jason Cammisa shows us the outcome of the race and explains how it happened by walking back through slow-mo time at the finish line.\n\nThe Corvette E-Ray combines the Z06's wide body with the base Stingray's 6.2-liter LS2 V-8 and a front-mounted, 160-hp electric motor. Launches are now wheelspin-free and no-drama as the E-Ray rockets from 0-60 in just 2.4 seconds — making this the quickest Corvette in history.\n\nAnd, at 3925 lb, the heaviest.

(The Walking Dead).
