Love y'all...Thank you.\n\nClick here to listen:\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/wiiltbam\n\nFollow DAX: @ thatsdax \nShot by: Logan Meis\nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#ToBeAMan #Dax #masculinity #manhood #manosphere #masculine #men #traditionalman \n\nLyrics:\n\nI can‚Äôt hide myself\nI don‚Äôt expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it‚Äôs like to be a man\nIt‚Äôs a lonely road, and they don‚Äôt care about what you know\nIt‚Äôs not about how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nYeah\nI know this life can really beat you down\nYou wanna scream but you won‚Äôt make a sound\nGot so much weight that you've been holding but won‚Äôt show any emotion\nAs a man it goes unspoken\nThat we can‚Äôt cry when life gets hard\nUnconditional love‚Äôs for women, children, and dogs\nWe know that we just have to play our parts\nAnd don‚Äôt nobody give a d*mn about our broken hearts, yeah\n \nAs a man we gotta pave our way\nOur only function is to work and slave\nThere‚Äôs no respect for you if you ain‚Äôt payed\nYou‚Äôre disregarded as a human and you can‚Äôt complain\n And if you ever make it up and actually reach that place\nAnd find a woman that you love and give her your last name\nYou‚Äôll feel the things that you provide is only why she stays\nAnd when you try to explain you‚Äôll say‚Ä¶\n \nI can‚Äôt hide myself\nI don‚Äôt expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it‚Äôs like to be a man\nIt‚Äôs a lonely road and they don‚Äôt care about what you know\nIt‚Äôs not bout how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nDon‚Äôt give up, keep fightin‚Äô\nAs a man our son(sun) is our horizon\nAnd our father‚Äôs actions play a role\nAnd we end up like ‚Äòem\nSo they can‚Äôt let us see them hurt\n‚ÄòCause we‚Äôll embody what they do\nAnd start a generational curse\n No wonder most men are so depressed\nAll the things that they can‚Äôt express\nThey go to war \nget thrown on the shelf\nThen go back to war with their mental health\nThen grab that bottle and ask for help\nTry to pull themselves out of h*ll\nThen fall back down and then realize that they gon‚Äô have to do it themselves\n \nIt‚Äôs the circle of life\nAs a man you provide\nThey don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre worth ‚Äòtil the day that you die\nAnd that‚Äôs when they start cryin‚Äô\nThen move on to a man to confide in\n \nThat‚Äôs why we feel\nWe can‚Äôt hide ourselves\nWe don‚Äôt expect you to understand\nWe just hope we can explain\nWhat it‚Äôs like to be a man\nIt‚Äôs a lonely road and you don‚Äôt care about what we know\nIt‚Äôs not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n \nThat home\nIt‚Äôs not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. TBH this is the most excited I've ever felt about a song.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread and create healthy conversation. I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout life. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world.

{"description":"Gordon Murray's astonishing ¬£2.8m T.50 is a 963kg, 654bhp three-seater that aims to right the wrongs of the McLaren F1. Not that it was famed for many. But 969 days after we got our first proper look at it, Gordon has given the car his official stamp of approval to bring development to a close, meaning we could finally have a go in it. \n\nNow, we don‚Äôt normally do passenger rides at Top Gear, but when three-time Indy 500 winner Dario Franchitti gives you a ring to ask if you want a lift, you don‚Äôt say no. Especially when it involves some flat-out runs so we can hear that naturally aspirated V12 scream as he works the six-speed manual gearbox. And ‚Äì best of all ‚Äì as it's a three-seater, it meant both Top Gear Magazine‚Äôs Jack Rix and Ollie Marriage could both have a go. And then pincer Dario with questions at 180mph.\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks¬†\nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

The battle, which was fought between British and French forces versus German forces, kicked off on July 1, 1916, and ended on November 18 that same year.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\nMusic video was produced by Video Ink Ltd. https://www.videoink.co.uk\n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.","title":"SABATON - 1916 (Official Music Video)","duration":454,"channel_id":"UCjQhd1APsd5NQhiVZV7GYzg","author":"Sabaton","date":"20230414","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgGhhnQB1gw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HgGhhnQB1gw/hqdefault.webp?v=6433c014","content":{"View count":273254}}

In the late 1950s, Air Force planners were confident that the advent of powerful new radars and long-range air-to-air missiles had rendered close-range aerial combat a thing of the past. So fighter jets like venerable the Mcdonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom were not engineered to be light or agile like their predecessors. Instead, they were designed to be heavily-loaded with missiles and carry powerful radars. Their pilots were no longer trained to dogfight, as they would engage the enemy at great distances, well beyond visual range. \n\nBut in the Vietnam War, military planners learned the hard way that the age of dogfighting was far from over. American pilots were being downed at alarming rates. The Friend or Foe (IFF) systems designed to identify enemy targets proved unreliable, forcing Air Force pilots to get in close to visually identify targets. At close-range, up against more agile Soviet-built MiGs, the F-4s were at a disadvantage. They were less agile than the MiGs, lacked a gun for close-range combat, and their pilots weren‚Äôt properly trained. To make matters worse, 1967, the Soviet Union looked set to unveil what appeared to be a new super-fighter built for extreme maneuverability. \n\nThe devastating experience from Vietnam and concerns being outclassed in the skies pushed the United States to develop a new air-superiority fighter that could face off with any current or future Soviet-built fighter. The result would be a twin-engine, high-performance, all-weather air superiority fighter known for its incredible acceleration and agility. Engineered from the ground up for tactical dominance in any air space, the F-15 holds the distinction of over a hundred aerial victories without a single defeat. \n\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\n\nIntro Song:  ‚ÄòRequiem for Humanity Alternate‚Äô- https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/CEZ_CET_9065\n\nSong 1: ‚ÄòThe Final Warning‚Äô - https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/MYMA_JUST_0234\n\nSong 2: ‚ÄòWeapon of Choice‚Äô -  https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/JL2Rr4Yi1B/\n\nSong 3: ‚ÄòInfiltration And Investigation‚Äô - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/141553842-infiltration-and-investigationdark-suspense-infiltration-sce\n\nSong 4: ‚ÄòSomething Is Coming‚Äô - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/102107772-b-lynne-something-coming-no-legato-strings-orchestra-epic-su\n\nSong 5: ‚Äò80s Glam Rock‚Äô - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-glam-rock/32401699\n\nSong 6: ‚ÄòBaliachi‚Äô - https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/CEZ_CEZ_4256\n\nSong 7: ‚Äò80'S Dark Synthwave‚Äô - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/53759123-80s-dark-synthwave\n\nSong 8: ‚ÄòViking Tension‚Äô - https://audiojungle.net/item/viking-tension/40074535\n\nSong 9: ‚ÄòSynthwave Technology Industrial‚Äô - https://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave-technology-industrial/35272023\n\nThanks for watching!","title":"The World's Greatest Fighter Jet: The F-15 Eagle","duration":861,"channel_id":"UC1ZBQ-F-yktYD4m5AzM6pww","author":"Mustard","date":"20230413","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmlWmDokzGg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RmlWmDokzGg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":895774}}

Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.\"","title":"Take a Break: Kardashian-Jenner Momager","duration":769,"channel_id":"UCJ0uqCI0Vqr2Rrt1HseGirg","author":"The Late Late Show with James Corden","date":"20230412","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6V5rlWZ9Zk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r6V5rlWZ9Zk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1177626}}

Meanwhile, B.S.A.A. agent Chris Redfield is investigating a zombie outbreak in San Francisco, where the cause of the infection cannot be identified. The only thing the victims have in common is that they all visited Alcatraz Island recently. Following that clue, Chris and his team head to the island, where a new horror awaits them. Directed by Eiichiro Hasumi (Assassination Classroom) from a screenplay by Makoto Fukami (Psycho-Pass). Based on Resident Evil, the hit survival-horror game that sold over 130 million copies worldwide, Death Island is a new CG animated film and sequel to Resident Evil: Vendetta.

Somehow Heavy Spoilers has returned and with this episode clearly also setting up things coming in Ahsoka there's a lot to talk about. We of course also have that finale next week so make sure you don't miss a thing subscribing to the channel and also please smash that thumbs up button if you enjoy the video.\n\nThis is the way.\n\nAnuyway last week saw the who we time travelled with in the mans delorean getting taken down by Bo and The Mandalorian.\n\n-\n\nThis was in an effort to get back to Bo's old crew which is where she had an axe to grind over no longer being the leader. Defeating woves she then presented with the Darksaber due to her technically winning it in combat all the way back in episode 2.\n\nThat takes us into this entry which sees the return of Moff Gideon and also the introduction of The Shadow Council.\n\nGideon ends up getting his own Mandalorian armour in this entry and you might remember that back in our episode 5 breakdown that we talked about a big clue towards this.","title":"THE MANDALORIAN Season 3 Episode 7 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Easter Eggs & Review","duration":1955,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230412","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSX-fL-Cg4s","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cSX-fL-Cg4s/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":339942}}

{"description":"Teresa Xie | April 10, 2023\nWhen Fred again.. first proposed a Tiny Desk concert, it wasn't immediately clear how he was going to make it work ‚Äî not because he lacked creativity, but because translating purely electronic music at the Desk is a daunting task for anyone. How would an artist, whose performances take the form of DJ sets in front of massive audiences, curate an intimate and unique experience? But what the British songwriter and producer came up with is a reminder of what a Tiny Desk is at its best: an opportunity for artists to challenge themselves in such a way that it almost feels like they're making new music, all while sticking to what feels true to them. For Fred again.. that meant re-learning the marimba, playing the vibraphone, singing at the piano and looping sounds and beats ‚Äî all at the same time. He began his set with \"Kyle (i found you),\" recreating the song's melody on the marimba while clips of featured poet Kyle \"Guante\" Tran Myhre reciting the work \"Love In The Time of Undeath\" appeared on-screen. Sitting at the piano, he faded the remnants of \"Kyle (i found you)\" into \"Roze (forgive),\" which features Fred again.. triggering vocals sampled from the artist I am Roze, whose powerful facial expressions were magnified on a screen.In a surprising pivot, the primary vocals on the following track, \"Me (heavy),\" came from Fred again.. himself, with no manipulation, creating a vulnerable sense of intimacy in the space. A flurry of looped piano keys marked the transition to \"Delilah (pull me out of this),\" with guest vocals pulled from pop singer Delilah Montagu's 2021 track \"Lost Keys.\" By his set's end, concluding with \"Faisal (envelops me),\" Fred again.. was back at the piano finally resting after moving seamlessly through a jam-packed Tiny Desk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Kyle (i found you)\"\n\"Roze (forgive)\"\n\"Adam (interlude)\"\n\"Me (heavy)\"\n\"Berwyn (interlude)\"\n\"Delilah (pull me out of this)\"\n\"Faisal (envelops me)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nFred again..: vocals, piano, vibraphone, marimba, electronics\nSpecial thanks to: Guante, I Am Roze (they/them), Amin√©, Delilah Montagu, Berwyn, Faisal, Lucy Hickling, Gareth Nunns, Jamie Tinsley, Tony Friend, Tobias Miorin¬†\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Sofia Seidel¬†\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Sofia Seidel, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant¬†\nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv√°n, Teresa Xie\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #fredagain","title":"Fred again..: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1604,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230410","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQmPv_dTI0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4iQmPv_dTI0/hqdefault.jpg?v=643085c1","content":{"View count":1848339}}
