{"description":"One king will lead us all. #Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - Only in theaters December 20.\n\nDirector James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa‚Äîalong with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman‚Äîreturn in the sequel to the highest-grossing DC film of all time: ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom.‚Äù\n\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father‚Äôs death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman‚Äôs family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.\n\nAll returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman‚Äôs half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother‚Äôs reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis‚Äô Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father‚Äôs death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.\n\nDirected by Wan, ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom‚Äù is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.\n\nThe screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa‚Äôa Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. \n\nJoining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (‚ÄúThe Conjuring 2‚Äù), production designer Bill Brzeski (‚ÄúJumanji: The Next Level‚Äù), editor Kirk Morri (‚ÄúFurious 7‚Äù), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (‚ÄúMalignant‚Äù). Visual effects supervisor Nick Davis (‚ÄúThe Clash of the Titans‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight‚Äù) and costume designer Richard Sale (‚ÄúDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,‚Äù ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù) also join.\n\nWarner Bros.

{"description":"Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n______FAQs_______\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Grind 37.5g of coffee, finer than pour over setting (but not close to espresso fine)\n2. Preheat your immersion brewer.\n3. Depending on the brewer, either add coffee and then 330g of freshly boiled, clean, soft water (or add water first then coffee after)\n4. Make sure all the coffee is mixed with the water and no dry pockets remain\n5. Steep for at least 5 minutes (or 4 minutes for darker roasts)\n6. Place 170g of ice straight from the freezer into a carafe.\n7. Strain the coffee onto the ice\n8. Once the brewer has drawn down and finished, stir in any remaining ice.\n9. Serve over ice and enjoy!\n\nRatios for Immersion Iced Coffee (Using 75g/L, or about 1:13 as a ratio)\n1 Cup: 19g coffee, 165g hot water, 85g ice\n2 Cups: 37.5g coffee, 330g hot water, 170g ice\n3 Cups: 56.5g coffee, 495g hot water, 255g ice\n4 Cups: 75g coffee, 660g hot brew water, 340g ice\nImportant: You have some flexibility on these.

{"description":"Trolls Band Together - In Theaters November 17\n\nThis holiday season, get ready for an action-packed, all-star, rainbow-colored family reunion like no other as Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake return for the new chapter in DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs blockbuster musical franchise: Trolls Band Together. \n\nAfter two films of true friendship and relentless flirting, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) are now officially, finally, a couple (#broppy)! As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past. He was once part of her favorite boyband phenomenon, BroZone, with his four brothers: Floyd (Golden Globe nominated electropop sensation Troye Sivan), John Dory (Eric Andr√©; Sing 2), Spruce (Grammy winner Daveed Diggs; Hamilton) and Clay (Grammy winner Kid Cudi; Don‚Äôt Look Up). BroZone disbanded when Branch was still a baby, as did the family, and Branch hasn‚Äôt seen his brothers since.  \n\nBut when Branch‚Äôs bro Floyd is kidnapped for his musical talents by a pair of nefarious pop-star villains‚ÄîVelvet (Emmy winner Amy Schumer; Trainwreck) and Veneer (Grammy winner and Tony nominee Andrew Rannells; The Book of Mormon)‚ÄîBranch and Poppy embark on a harrowing and emotional journey to reunite the other brothers and rescue Floyd from a fate even worse than pop-culture obscurity. \n\nFeaturing Trolls‚Äô signature psychedelic joy-bomb of new and classic pop hits, Trolls Band Together stars a dazzling cast of musical superstars and comedic powerhouses as new franchise characters, including four-time Grammy nominee and Latin Grammy winner Camila Cabello (Cinderella) as Viva; Zosia Mamet (The Flight Attendant) as Crimp; and 12-time Emmy winning drag icon RuPaul Charles as Miss Maxine. \n\nThe returning cast includes Grammy, Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Zooey Deschanel as Bridget; Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Gristle, the Icona Pop duo Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt as Satin and Chenille, Grammy winner Anderson .Paak as Prince D, comedian Ron Funches as Cooper, SAG nominee Kunal Nayyar as Guy Diamond and Emmy winning Saturday Night Live legend Kenan Thompson as Tiny Diamond. \n\nTrolls Band Together is steered by returning director Walt Dohrn and producer Gina Shay, and is co-directed by Tim Heitz (head of story, Trolls World Tour). DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs Trolls films‚Äî2016‚Äôs Trolls and 2020‚Äôs Trolls World Tour‚Äîhave sung and danced their way to record-breaking success, earning an Oscar¬Æ nomination for Best Original Song and fueling one of the largest and most beloved entertainment brands in the world.\n\nSocial:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DreamWorksTrolls   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/trolls \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/trolls \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@trolls \nWebsite: http://www.trollsmovie.com/  \n#TrollsBandTogether\n\nPre-save to be the first to hear music from the movie! https://www.trollssoundtrack.com/","title":"TROLLS BAND TOGETHER | Official Trailer 2","duration":174,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230914","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftUpFjGKuY0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ftUpFjGKuY0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3464512}}

{"description":"The final trailer for Killers of the Flower Moon - a Martin Scorsese picture. In theaters everywhere October 20.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), ‚ÄúKillers of the Flower Moon‚Äù is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, Tantoo Cardinal, Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins, and Jillian Dion, Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Scorsese, based on David Grann‚Äôs best-selling book.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, Killers of the Flower Moon was produced alongside Imperative Entertainment, Sikelia Productions and Appian Way. Producers are Scorsese, Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas and Daniel Lupi, with DiCaprio, Rick Yorn, Adam Somner, Marianne Bower, Lisa Frechette, John Atwood, Shea Kammer and Niels Juul serving as executive producers.\n\n#KillersOfTheFlowerMoon #Trailer","title":"Killers of the Flower Moon ‚Äî Official Trailer 2","duration":144,"channel_id":"UC1Myj674wRVXB9I4c6Hm5zA","author":"Apple TV","date":"20230913","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1oqFhyjebw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/f1oqFhyjebw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":468435}}

{"description":"Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances ‚Äì either side if the interval ‚Äì and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"Don‚Äôt miss the full trailer this Thursday. #Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - Only in theaters December 20.\n\nDirector James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa‚Äîalong with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman‚Äîreturn in the sequel to the highest-grossing DC film of all time: ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom.‚Äù\n\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father‚Äôs death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman‚Äôs family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.\n\nAll returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman‚Äôs half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother‚Äôs reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis‚Äô Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father‚Äôs death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.\n\nDirected by Wan, ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom‚Äù is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.\n\nThe screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa‚Äôa Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. \n\nJoining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (‚ÄúThe Conjuring 2‚Äù), production designer Bill Brzeski (‚ÄúJumanji: The Next Level‚Äù), editor Kirk Morri (‚ÄúFurious 7‚Äù), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (‚ÄúMalignant‚Äù). Visual effects supervisor Nick Davis (‚ÄúThe Clash of the Titans‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight‚Äù) and costume designer Richard Sale (‚ÄúDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,‚Äù ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù) also join.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents An Atomic Monster / A Peter Safran Production of A James Wan Film, ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom,‚Äù set to open in theaters internationally beginning 20 December 2023 and in North America on December 20, 2023; it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.
