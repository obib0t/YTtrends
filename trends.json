{"description":"Discover the legend that forged the rings. September 2 on Prime Video. #TheRingsOfPower\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power - SDCC Trailer","duration":182,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220722","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYnQDsaxHZU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYnQDsaxHZU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5819254}}

{"description":"Amy was willing to do anything to get Sonic to notice her. She just wanted Sonic and Amy to become a thing. A Sonamy thing. And that’s where Tails came in. In an effort to cross the Sonic frontiers – from friendship to relationship – Amy Rose had the two-tailed fox head up her transformation into what she thought would be the dream girl of Sonic the Hedgehog. But, has that resulted in her being able to call herself Mrs. Sonic Hedgehog? Well… you’ll see.\n\nThis isn’t a Sonic Origins story. This isn’t some Sonic game to the pink-haired girl. In fact, she’s got a bad case of Sonic mania. What began as a romantic comedy in her mind, has turned into a Sonic vs Amy nightmare for her. Forget Sonic exe: Amy exe has entered the chat.

{"description":"Are you ready to live the life you deserve? \n#DontWorryDarling \nOnly in theaters September 23.\n\nFrom New Line Cinema comes “Don’t Worry Darling,” directed by Olivia Wilde (“Booksmart”) and starring Florence Pugh (Oscar-nominated for “Little Women”), Harry Styles (“Dunkirk”), Wilde (upcoming “Babylon”), Gemma Chan (“Crazy Rich Asians”), KiKi Layne (“The Old Guard”) and Chris Pine (“All the Old Knives”). \n\nAlice (Pugh) and Jack (Styles) are lucky to be living in the idealized community of Victory, the experimental company town housing the men who work for the top-secret Victory Project and their families. The 1950’s societal optimism espoused by their CEO, Frank (Pine)—equal parts corporate visionary and motivational life coach—anchors every aspect of daily life in the tight-knit desert utopia.\n\nWhile the husbands spend every day inside the Victory Project Headquarters, working on the “development of progressive materials,” their wives—including Frank’s elegant partner, Shelley (Chan)—get to spend their time enjoying the beauty, luxury and debauchery of their community. Life is perfect, with every resident’s needs met by the company. All they ask in return is discretion and unquestioning commitment to the Victory cause.\n\nBut when cracks in their idyllic life begin to appear, exposing flashes of something much more sinister lurking beneath the attractive façade, Alice can’t help questioning exactly what they’re doing in Victory, and why. Just how much is Alice willing to lose to expose what’s really going on in this paradise?\n\nAn audacious, twisted and visually stunning psychological thriller, “Don’t Worry Darling” is a powerhouse feature from director Olivia Wilde that boasts intoxicating performances from Florence Pugh and Harry Styles, surrounded by the impressive and pitch-perfect cast.\n\nThe film also stars Nick Kroll (“How It Ends”), Sydney Chandler (“Pistol”), Kate Berlant (“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood”), Asif Ali (“WandaVision”), Douglas Smith (“Big Little Lies”), Timothy Simons (“Veep”) and Ari’el Stachel (upcoming “Respect the Jux”).\n\nWilde directs from a screenplay penned by her “Booksmart” writer Katie Silberman, based on a story by Carey Van Dyke & Shane Van Dyke (“Chernobyl Diaries”) and Silberman. The film is produced by Wilde, Silberman, Miri Yoon and Roy Lee, with Richard Brener, Celia Khong, Alex G. Scott, Catherine Hardwicke, Carey Van Dyke and Shane Van Dyke executive producing.\n\nWilde is joined behind the camera by two-time Oscar-nominated director of photography Matthew Libatique (“A Star Is Born,” “Black Swan”), production designer Katie Byron (“Booksmart”), editor Affonso Gonçalves (“The Lost Daughter”), Oscar-nominated composer John Powell (“Jason Bourne”), music supervisor Randall Poster (“No Time to Die”) and costume designer Arianne Phillips (“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood”).\n\nA New Line Cinema presentation, “Don’t Worry Darling” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on September 23, 2022 and internationally beginning 21 September 2022.","title":"Don't Worry Darling | Official Trailer #2","duration":176,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

{"description":"Danni Sanders (Zoey Deutch), an aimless aspiring writer with no friends, no romantic prospects and — worst of all — no followers, fakes an Instagram-friendly trip to Paris in the hopes of boosting her social media clout. When a terrifying incident strikes the City of Lights, Danni unwittingly falls into a lie bigger than she ever imagined. She \"returns\" a hero, even striking up an unlikely friendship with Rowan (Mia Isaac), a real trauma survivor dedicated to societal change, and scooping up the man of her dreams Colin (Dylan O'Brien). As an influencer and advocate, Danni finally has the life and audience she always wanted. But it’s only a matter of time before the façade cracks, and she learns the hard way that the Internet loves a takedown. \n\nCast: Zoey Deutch, Dylan O'Brien, Mia Isaac\n\nSubscribe To Searchlight Pictures: https://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures\n\n#NotOkayMovie #ZoeyDeutch #DylanOBrien #Searchlight \n\nConnect with Searchlight Online\nVisit the Searchlight WEBSITE: https://www.searchlightpictures.com/\nLike Searchlight on FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/searchlightpics\n\nNOT OKAY | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures","title":"NOT OKAY | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures","duration":156,"channel_id":"UCor9rW6PgxSQ9vUPWQdnaYQ","author":"SearchlightPictures","date":"20220721","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvby6Z0vWmA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xvby6Z0vWmA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1882988}}

{"description":"Halloween Ends\n10.14.22\nhttps://www.halloweenmovie.com/\n\nThis is Laurie Strode’s last stand. \n\nAfter 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive. \n\nIcon Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the last time as Laurie Strode, horror’s first “final girl” and the role that launched Curtis’ career. Curtis has portrayed Laurie for more than four decades now, one of the longest actor-character pairings in cinema history. When the franchise relaunched in 2018, Halloween shattered box office records, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing chapter and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a horror film starring a woman. \n\nFour years after the events of last year’s Halloween Kills, Laurie is living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and is finishing writing her memoir. Michael Myers hasn’t been seen since. Laurie, after allowing the specter of Michael to determine and drive her reality for decades, has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell; The Hardy Boys, Virgin River), is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can’t control, once and for all. \n\nHalloween Ends co-stars returning cast Will Patton as Officer Frank Hawkins, Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and James Jude Courtney as The Shape.  \n\nFrom the creative team that relaunched the franchise with 2018’s Halloween and Halloween Kills, the film is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Paul Brad Logan (Manglehorn), Chris Bernier (The Driver series), Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Halloween Ends is produced by Malek Akkad, Jason Blum and Bill Block. The executive producers are John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Ryan Freimann, Ryan Turek, Andrew Golov, Thom Zadra and Christopher H. Warner. \n\nUniversal Pictures, Miramax and Blumhouse present a Malek Akkad production, in association with Rough House Pictures. \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/halloweenmovie/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/halloweenmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HalloweenMovie/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics?lang=en","title":"Halloween Ends - Official Trailer","duration":76,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20220720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mAWKyfj6c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/i_mAWKyfj6c/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2807260}}

{"description":"Julian Alvarez, Stefan Ortega Moreno and Kalvin Phillips played their first game as Manchester City players as we returned to action with victory over Club America in the opening match of our pre-season tour of the United States.\n\nErling Haaland was an unused substitute as Kevin De Bruyne’s brace gave Pep Guardiola’s side a 2-1 win over the Mexican outfit at Houston’s NRG Stadium.\n\nThe Belgian opened the scoring with a trademark finish on the half hour mark, riding two challenges on a burst forward and curling a wonderful 18-yard effort into the far corner.\n\nClub America levelled against the run of play 13 minutes later as striker Henry Martin latched onto a lofted ball over the top and checked inside Nathan Ake before squeezing the ball between Ortega Moreno’s legs.\n\nDe Bruyne sealed the win on the stroke of half-time, ghosting in behind the opposition defence to collect Riyad Mahrez’s perfectly weighted through ball and firing underneath Oscar Jimenez.\n\nSUBSCRIBE! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mancity\n\nhttp://www.mancity.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/mancity\nhttp://www.twitter.com/mancity\nhttp://www.instagram.com/mancity\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mancity\n\nAbout the Official Man City YouTube Channel:\n\nHere you will find all the latest videos from Manchester City, including, all Premier League goals, highlights, behind-the-scenes footage, training and much more.\n\nGet closer to the likes of Jack Grealish, Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling, Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden and the rest of Pep Guardiola's team.","title":"HIGHLIGHTS!

{"description":"Machine Gun Kelly ft. glaive - more than life (Official Live Performance) \n\nWhether rapping, as he did in the early part of his career, or rocking, as he's doing these days, Machine Gun Kelly is one of those artists who starts fierce and gets fiercer. That impact comes from the punch of emotion at the core of his tunes - the guy comes on strong from the get-go. You can hear it on 2012's \"Wild Boy\" from his 'Lace Up' debut, and it's there on both the 'BINGE' and 'bloom' albums from a few years ago. In May, Billboard said \"there’s no one on the charts serving balls-to-the-wall rock’n’roll decadence like the 31-year-old musician.\" It's hard to disagree. Since he turned a punk-pop corner with blistering guitar tracks such as \"bloody valentine\" - a blitzkrieg bop if there ever was one - the Halsey duet \"forget me too,\" and his blackbear romp \"my ex's best friend,\" he's moved from respected cool guy to flat-out superstar. And he takes the success in stride; the name of his latest album is 'mainstream sellout.' If you caught the Billboard Awards in May, you know he poured it all out in his performance of \"Twin Flame.\" So much so that his sweetie Megan Fox tweeted her approval in a gushing example of PDA. \"Baby – so proud of you for giving such a vulnerable and emotional performance. You are magic.\" Fans will think something similar when they're done with our Official Live Performances. MGK roared through \"more than life\" with his pal glaive, and yes, they destroyed.

{"description":"This Video breaks youtube! How you might ask? Well the 2022 youtube algorithm is a unique creature with many fun exploits and algorithm glitches that allow us to manipulate it for extreme results. One such manipulation is watchtime! This is a great way for youtube to see if a video is clickbait or so interesting people watch it for longer potentially even replaying parts of it! So when a video has comparatively high watch time in comparison to other videos then the youtube algorithm loves to push it! \n\nSo today the spiffing brit exploits youtube with the 0.5x playback speed exploit that will double the amount of watch time the video gets. So watch as the youtube algorithm explained leads to some perfectly balanced results!  After all youtube seo is not needed when you ask how to grow on youtube with this completely unusable meta youtube algorithm hack!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience.

{"description":"When adjusted for inflation, wages have remained virtually unchanged over the last 50 years, with workers today earning just 12 cents more than they did in 1972. And with inflation at its highest since 1971, Americans are feeling the pain of slow wage growth. Two-thirds of American workers said that inflation has outpaced any salary gains made in the past year. But some economists argue that the concept is merely a myth politicians use to promote their careers. So, how real is wage stagnation in America today and what does it mean for American workers?

If the sloshes get too far apart, we call it a drought. And at least one study has estimated that the past two decades have been the driest period in more than a thousand years for the southwestern United States, leading to a so-called “mega-drought.” (Source: https://www.npr.org/2022/02/14/1080302434/study-finds-western-megadrought-is-the-worst-in-1-200-years)\n\nLike the t-shirt? https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Better Call Saul Season 6 Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained. In-depth recap and review of “Fun and Games”. Please subscribe! 👉 http://bit.ly/PetePeppers\n\nIn the ninth episode of Better Call Saul's final season, we wrapped up the story of Jimmy McGill in the prequel's timeline. In the end, Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) made a decision to leave because even though she loves Jimmy (Bob Odenkirk), she contends that they are like poison when they are together. \n\nIn episode 9 after the breakup, the show jumps ahead in time to the Breaking Bad timeline. We see that Jimmy has completely transformed into Saul Goodman with Kim out of his life.  \n\nEpisode 609: “Fun and Games”\nDirected by Michael Morris\nWritten by Ann Cherkis\nOriginal Air Date July 18, 2022\nOfficial Synopsis: Gus attempts to smooth things over with the cartel while Mike ties up loose ends.\n\nHeralded as “a beautiful tragedy and gripping character drama” (IndieWire) and “one of the best dramas on television” (Vulture), Saul’s 13-episode final season will roll out in two parts with the first seven episodes beginning April 18 and culminating with the series’ final six episodes beginning July 11. \n\nBetter Call Saul’s final season concludes the complicated journey and transformation of its compromised hero, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), into criminal lawyer Saul Goodman. From the cartel to the courthouse, from Albuquerque to Omaha, season six tracks Jimmy, Saul and Gene as well as Jimmy’s complex relationship with Kim (Rhea Seehorn), who is in the midst of her own existential crisis. Meanwhile, Mike (Jonathan Banks), Gus (Giancarlo Esposito), Nacho (Michael Mando) and Lalo (Tony Dalton) are locked into a game of cat and mouse with mortal stakes.\n\nIf you want to leave me a tip for my work 💰 https://paypal.me/petepeppersYT\n\nWhat are your favorite BCS theories for the upcoming season 6?

Jimmy becomes the lawyer for former beat cop Mike Ehrmantraut,  whose relevant skill set allows him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The show premiered on AMC on February 8, 2015. The show's sixth and final season premiered on April 18, 2022.\n\nChapter Timestamps\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:23 Episode 9 Recap\n12:19 Ending\n\n#BetterCallSaul #BetterCallSaulSeason6 #BreakingBad","title":"Better Call Saul Season 6 Episode 9 Breakdown | Recap & Review","duration":928,"channel_id":"UC8zAiZUuUXe-touFVopBbZw","author":"Pete Peppers","date":"20220719","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB-zx_P_51I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YB-zx_P_51I/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":309661}}
