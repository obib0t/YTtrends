{"description":"Season 3 launches in THEATERS November 18 (get your info at https://www.thechosen.tv/3 ), and then comes to streaming shortly after that. If you haven't seen Seasons 1 & 2, search \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your apps and on your streaming devices.\n \n“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” That's the theme of Season 3, and man, that applied to those of us making the show as well. It's taken a long time for Season 3 to get here, and believe me, it wasn't by choice. From supply chain issues affecting our construction, to Covid delays, to weather, the making of Season 3 for sure made us weary and heavy-laden. We don't get to escape the themes of each season.\n \nBut as you'll see from this trailer, I believe it was worth it. We launch Season Three in theaters, with Episodes 1 & 2 coming to most English-speaking countries on November 18 for a limited run on the big screen. And don't worry, if you can't see it in theaters, you'll soon after get it free and easy on streaming. So what are you going to see?\n \nSeason Three picks up where Season Two left off (you should watch that season if you haven't-—I promise Season Three will make more sense), with Jesus delivering the most famous sermon in history. What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. This creates confusion, chaos, and yes, doubt, and we don't gloss over any of that in this season. I assure you, you're going to see some tough questions asked that you've no doubt experienced yourself. But...\n \nHe gives rest.\n \nThank you for your patience with this season. The good news is, while you've been waiting, literally tens of millions of people around the world have discovered The Chosen, and we are optimistic Season 3 will enlarge this movement even more. Be sure to watch this entire trailer for all the info you'll need to experience Season 3.

In this film, senior FT writers and British businesspeople examine how Brexit hit the UK economy, the political conspiracy of silence, and why there has not yet been a convincing case for a 'Brexit dividend'.\n\n#brexit #ukeconomy #business #EU #europeanunion #Tories #conservatives #Labour #labourparty #ukip #britain #ukpolitics #UKbusiness #liztruss #BorisJohnson #kwasikwarteng #KeirStarmer #jeremyhunt #NigelFarage #UK #unitedkingdom #news #uknews #currentaffairs #bondmarket #gilts #sterling #tradebonds #markets #financialmarkets #finance #investing  \n\n00:00 - The Brexit effect\n01:41 - The economic impact\n04:40 - Brexit and business\n09:45 - Britain falls behind\n13:45 - The labour market\n15:05 - Northern Ireland conundrum \n16:50 - The conspiracy of silence\n18:57 - Winners and losers\n21:17 - The Brexit 'dividend\n\nSee if you get the FT for free as a student (http://ft.com/schoolsarefree) or start a £1 trial: https://subs.ft.com/spa3_trial?segmentId=3d4ba81b-96bb-cef0-9ece-29efd6ef2132.\r\n\r\n► Check out our Community tab for more stories on the economy.\r\n►  Listen to our podcasts: https://www.ft.com/podcasts\r\n►  Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/financialtimes'","title":"The Brexit effect: how leaving the EU hit the UK | FT Film","duration":1704,"channel_id":"UCoUxsWakJucWg46KW5RsvPw","author":"Financial Times","date":"20221018","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO2lWmgEK1Y","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wO2lWmgEK1Y/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":862986}}

{"description":"The Philadelphia Eagles remain the only undefeated team in the league after beating the Dallas Cowboys last night with a final score of 26-17. After Dallas headed into halftime in a 20-3 hole, they came back to narrow Philly’s lead 20-17. Ultimately, they could not stop Jalen Hurts. He had 155 yards for two touchdowns. Meanwhile, Cooper Rush struggled and had three interceptions.

{"description":"The first 1,000 people to use this link will get a 1 month free trial of Skillshare: https://skl.sh/caseyaonso10222 Thanks again to Skillshare for sponsoring! \n\nExploring the World's Messiest Girl Group: Fifth Harmony \n\nHey everyone welcome back to my channel! Today we're going to be doing a video that I've been wanting to make for YEARS but never followed through with just cause I felt like it didn't really fit the channel. Someone actually commented asking for this a few weeks back though (thank you btw! probably wouldn't have ended up doing it if you hadn't!!) so I took it as fate and thought it was about time we looked back on one of the messiest girl groups in history, Fifth Harmony. \n\nTo give a brief backstory on the group just in case you aren't aware of them, Fifth Harmony were a girl group consisting of Camila Cabello, Normani Kordei,  Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke and Dinah Jane that was formed on X Factor back in 2012. This was around the time that other X Factor groups like One Direction and Little Mix were active and doing well so they were seen as their American counterpart. After placing 3rd on the show they went on to release 2 EPs and 4 albums before going on hiatus in 2018 while Camila Cabello left the group in 2016. Since then all the girls are pursuing their solo careers. \n\nWhile Fifth Harmony has a great discography I think they're most well known for their footprint on the internet including a lot of shade, chaos and memes so I thought we could compile some of their best (and worst) moments as a group to look back on throughout all their eras from Better Together and Reflection all the way to 7/27 and their self titled era. This isn't going to be an exhaustive look at their history as a group because I wanted to focus more on the stand out moments that felt the most \"Fifth Harmony\" if that makes sense lol. But if there are moments that come to mind while watching please share them in the comments! I'm hoping that it'll be like a fun sea of chaotic memories from when the group were active lol. \n\nAs always if you enjoyed the video feel free to give it a like and subscribe it really helps me out! You can also turn on my post notifications if you wanna be notified every time I upload. But otherwise, really hope you guys enjoy and I'll see yall in the comment section!! :) \n\nSocials~*~*~*\n\n☞ IG: caseyaonso\n☞ Twitter: caseyaonso\n☞ Spotify: caseyaonso\n\n//Other videos you might like\n\nRanking Chaotic Celebrity PR Relationships\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP1pCrqoRdE\n\nA Definitive Ranking of Nepotism Babies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi_OrVeLNps\n\nA Definitive Ranking of Nepotism Babies (Part 2)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvWgFE6NubU\n\nExploring Celebrity Flop Eras\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rejqMZLcU3U\n\nA Definitive Ranking of Cringey Celebrity Couples (Part 2)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-7okUlou30\n\na definitive ranking of cringey celebrity couples\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAEH-NolOjc\n\nWhy Did Every Teen Show Age Like Milk?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgLeUeLvGsA\n\nTik Tok Turned Mental Illness into a qUirKy Trend... great\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5f0Qn09ywQ\n\nWas the Buzzfeed Era a Fever Dream?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrkTlnkPQ4k\n\ntik tok made \"i'm not like other girls\" trendy again... great  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO4IPgv8PII\n\nNetflix's Hype House Reality Show is an Absolute Disaster\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NcipNuRUzc\n\nthe true crime community is officially unhinged \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Yo3w_4qX8&ab_channel=CaseyAonso\n\nthe tik tok POV community is a disaster \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXBTmsXCYZc&ab_channel=CaseyAonso\n\nnetflix turned our worst wattpad nightmare into a movie... \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z-Cf2K2zJE&t=351s\n\nhustle culture is an absolute nightmare \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuZ-AoJb6rU&ab_channel=CaseyAonso","title":"Exploring the World's Messiest Girl Group: Fifth Harmony","duration":1014,"channel_id":"UCKGMrHJRXyM_WmPKS-lvE2A","author":"Casey Aonso","date":"20221017","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFZcrglyGis","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qFZcrglyGis/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":305043}}

The penultimate episode takes focus on the lean green Queen machine and it cements her villain arc and quest for power. In this video we're gonna be breaking down what happens in it, the easter eggs, book differences and also giving our thoughts what could happen in the finale next week.\n\nThis has been a massive season and I wanna thank you for all your support so far. We recently got our million subscriber plaque and it means more to me than a seat on the Iron Throne so I really appreciate it.\n\nNow the episode is called The Green Council and this term was coined by Grand Maester Munken in the book. The name brings a lot with it as it of course shows how this once unbiased council has now been twisted by alicent into supporting her side.\n\nWhereas the previous episodes all centred around Chapter 12 we are now in 13 which is titled the Dying Of The Dragons The Blacks Vs Greens. This war between the houses took place between 129 - 131 AC and the two years featured lots of deaths and the characters treating the Iron Thron like it's a game of musical chairs.\n\nThe period is known as the dance of the dragons but in the book its said that the phrase Dying of The Dragons is more suitable. The work is very much a chronicle of this time told to us by witnesses and maesters and it states that due to them trying to add a poetic flair to the story that they changed it to Dance.\n\nHowever it's an extremely brutal period that's described as seeing several of the last dragons being wiped out. The source material says it was a war marked by stealth, murder and betrayal which we see from this openining.","title":"HOUSE OF THE DRAGON Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Of Thrones Easter Eggs","duration":1713,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20221017","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS8A_FQKDxw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XS8A_FQKDxw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":734113}}

{"description":"A single curling stone certified for the Olympics costs over $600. That makes a full set of 16 stones worth $9,600. Since 2006, every stone used in the Olympic Winter Games has come from Kays of Scotland. The company has produced curling stones since 1851. But making these stones isn't easy. For every stone it makes, Kays uses granite from one tiny island off the coast of Scotland called Ailsa Craig. By combining Ailsa Craig's common green and blue hone granites, Kays produces the only stones allowed in World Curling Federation contests and the Winter Olympics.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE VIDEOS: \nWhy Oboes Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/_xOj9bLkYVQ\nWhy Chiso Kimonos Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/b3xOKlvlkHY\nWhy Honma Golf Clubs Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/HSMT5eZv7lA\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Olympics #Curling #Businessinsider\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\nBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcj\nBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29T\nBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGF\nBI on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBoot Camp on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Boot_Camp/3383377771\n\nWhy Olympic Curling Stones Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider","title":"Why Olympic Curling Stones Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider","duration":519,"channel_id":"UCcyq283he07B7_KUX07mmtA","author":"Business Insider","date":"20221015","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0GMaP0M6w0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0GMaP0M6w0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":6244692}}

I finished my 3 part series a few weeks ago where I fully customized an entire claw machine. Now, I'm ready to fill it with prizes like accessories, squishies, plushies, tumblers, hats, bags and MYSTERY BAGS (ooooh!), so I have lots of options for customizing. What will I win this episode?!\n\nWhat I'm Using:\nFelt Sheets: https://amzn.to/3VwItjX \nHot glue: https://amzn.to/3TjkQcO\nPuffy Paint: https://amzn.to/3s1Xmxb\n*contains affiliate links*\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 27 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here.

{"description":"QUEEN rediscovered track featuring Freddie Mercury ‘FACE IT ALONE’ arrives as digital single release Thursday October 13\nPrecedes arrival of Queen ‘The Miracle Collector’s Edition’ coming November 18 \n\nPre-order The Miracle-Collector's Edition: https://Queen.lnk.to/TheMiracle\nDownload/Stream Face It Alone: https://Queen.lnk.to/FaceItAlone\n\nHaving generated a media firestorm back in the summer when band members Brian May and Roger Taylor first leaked news of a rediscovered Queen song featuring Freddie Mercury being considered for possible release, the highly anticipated ‘lost’ track, ‘Face It Alone’, drops as a simultaneous worldwide single release Thursday 13 October, 11.15am BST.\n\nThe track’s existence was first revealed by May and Taylor in a BBC radio interview at their appearance at this year’s Royal Jubilee concert at which they performed the opening with their regular singer Adam Lambert, with Roger Taylor describing it as “a little gem from Freddie that we’d kind of forgotten about”, with Brian May saying “it’s beautiful, it’s touching.”\n\nThe track’s arrival as a single leads in a November 18 release of a new revisiting of the band’s 13th album, The Miracle, the band’s penultimate to be released in Freddie Mercury’s lifetime, which now becomes available in a lavish 8-disc Queen The Miracle Collector’s Edition box set format.\n\nAmong its contents, the expanded set includes The Miracle Sessions: an hour-plus disc of further previously unreleased recordings, including six unpublished songs. Just as tantalising for fans, the audio includes the band’s candid spoken exchanges on the studio floor in London and Montreux, giving the most revealing window yet into the four members’ creative process and the joy, in-jokes and banter on their return to working together.\n\n‘Face It Alone’ was originally recorded during the band’s historic 1988 sessions for that album, a prolific period which saw the band lay down around 30 tracks, many of which were never released, but remained among those that didn’t make the final album cut. It was rediscovered when the band’s production and archive team returned to those sessions to work on The Miracle box set reissue.\n\n“We’d kind of forgotten about this track,” admits Roger Taylor, “but there it was, this little gem. It’s wonderful, a real discovery. It’s a very passionate piece”.\n\nThe single will be the first new song featuring Freddie Mercury released in over 8 years. On 2014’s Queen Forever album the band included three previously unheard tracks with Mercury, including ‘Let Me in Your Heart Again,’ ‘Love Kills’ and ‘There Must Be More to Life Than This.’\n\nSpeaking of the rediscovered track, Brian May says: “I’m happy that our team were able to find this track.  After all these years, it’s great to hear all four of us … yes, Deacy is there too … working in the studio on a great song idea which never quite got completed … until now!”\n\nSubscribe to the official Queen channel Here https://Queen.lnk.to/Subscribe\nWatch more: https://Queen.lnk.to/OfficialMusicVideos\n\nAbout Queen:\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.
