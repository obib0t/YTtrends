{"description":"One king will lead us all. #Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - Only in theaters December 20.\n\nDirector James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa—along with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman—return in the sequel to the highest-grossing DC film of all time: “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.”\n\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father’s death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.\n\nAll returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman’s half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother’s reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis’ Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father’s death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.\n\nDirected by Wan, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.\n\nThe screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa’a Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. \n\nJoining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of “Aquaman” artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2”), production designer Bill Brzeski (“Jumanji: The Next Level”), editor Kirk Morri (“Furious 7”), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (“Malignant”). Visual effects supervisor Nick Davis (“The Clash of the Titans” films, “The Dark Knight”) and costume designer Richard Sale (“Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” “Ready Player One”) also join.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents An Atomic Monster / A Peter Safran Production of A James Wan Film, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” set to open in theaters internationally beginning 20 December 2023 and in North America on December 20, 2023; it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom | Trailer","duration":166,"channel_id":"UCiifkYAs_bq1pt_zbNAzYGg","author":"DC","date":"20230914","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV3bqvOHRQo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FV3bqvOHRQo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":6079368}}

Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! \n\nOn this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. \n\nIf you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.i","title":"Rick Shiels X Bob Does Sports 2v2 scramble!!","duration":2432,"channel_id":"UCFHZHhZaH7Rc_FOMIzUziJA","author":"Rick Shiels Golf","date":"20230913","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhKEC1WSjWY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PhKEC1WSjWY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":444245}}

{"description":"Don’t miss the full trailer this Thursday. #Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - Only in theaters December 20.\n\nDirector James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa—along with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman—return in the sequel to the highest-grossing DC film of all time: “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.”\n\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father’s death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.\n\nAll returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman’s half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother’s reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis’ Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father’s death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.\n\nDirected by Wan, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.\n\nThe screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa’a Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. \n\nJoining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of “Aquaman” artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2”), production designer Bill Brzeski (“Jumanji: The Next Level”), editor Kirk Morri (“Furious 7”), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (“Malignant”). Visual effects supervisor Nick Davis (“The Clash of the Titans” films, “The Dark Knight”) and costume designer Richard Sale (“Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” “Ready Player One”) also join.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents An Atomic Monster / A Peter Safran Production of A James Wan Film, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” set to open in theaters internationally beginning 20 December 2023 and in North America on December 20, 2023; it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom | Teaser","duration":30,"channel_id":"UCiifkYAs_bq1pt_zbNAzYGg","author":"DC","date":"20230911","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbb4e_Q6wR8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fbb4e_Q6wR8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1956907}}

{"description":"✨👉🏼 Go to https://casetify.com/alexg today to get 15% off on your cases!\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - A BUYING GUIDE\nI really think that there are a few options to save money this year with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Plus and the regular iPhone 15. \n\nIn this video, I'm sharing with you all the options for all budgets and depending on what you prioritise.\n\nRenders by ld_vova (on Twitter / X)\n\nThe new iPhone 15 Pro Max is the latest and greatest phone on the market, but don't let the hype fool you. There are plenty of other phones (including the Apple iPhone 14 and 13 models) out there that are just as good depending on your needs. The iPhone 15 Pro Max could be overpriced at launch and might not have any features that stand out for your needs. Instead, spend your hard-earned cash on something more worth your money!\n\nShould you upgrade to the latest Apple iPhone 15 this year? Or should you look at alternatives? Is the iPhone 13 or 14 Pro Max for example still a good alternative? Could you afford to wait for the iPhone 15? \n\nApple's iPhone 15 promises a few upgrades, a bigger battery, better camera specs and a new A17 chip. Are these upgrades significant? Join me in this video as we discuss where it may not make sense to upgrade to the iPhone 15. And also where it absolutely does make sense to upgrade. \n\nEven if you decided that you are upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, in some cases, an upgrade is inevitable right? \n\nBut even in those cases, it can be confusing on which model of the iPhone 15 should you go for. And is the iPhone 15 Pro range the best choice for you? Or could the iPhone 14 Pro Max or iPhone 14 Pro be a better option, especially given the likely drop in prices after the release date?\n\n#iphone15promax #AppleEvent #iPhone15 #Apple  #iPhone15Plus #iPhone15Pro \n\n⚡️ I have my own shop on Amazon now!

{"description":"FOX Sports’ lead college football analyst Joel Klatt marvels at the atmosphere in Boulder as Coach Prime won his home debut over Nebraska. Klatt breaks down what impressed him about their win while also considering how incredible it is that a Colorado team that was 1-11 last season is captivating the country right now. Next, he shifts to Texas’ huge win over Alabama and why it shows that the Longhorns are legitimate national championship contenders this year. He also reveals how far the win in Tuscaloosa launched Texas up his Top 10 rankings. Klatt states whether that game was a sign that Alabama under Saban is set for a fall from the sport’s elite programs.  He then discusses how scary USC is this year and why he believes this team is different than last year’s group.  He also goes in on how Texas A&M continues to fall short in the Jimbo Fisher era after their loss in Miami.  Finally, Klatt reacts to the news of Michigan State HC Mel Tucker being suspended without pay due to an investigation into sexual harassment allegations.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Joel Klatt Show content: \nhttps://rb.gy/7sbi9\n\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►The Joel Klatt Show YouTube Channel: https://bit.ly/joelklattshow_yt\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n \nSee more from The Joel Klatt Show: https://www.foxsports.com/shows/the-joel-klatt-show\n\nLike The Joel Klatt Show on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JoelKlattShow/\nFollow The Joel Klatt Show on Twitter: https://twitter.com/JoelKlattShow\nFollow The Joel Klatt Show on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joelklattshow/\n\nColorado & Coach Prime take down Nebraska, Texas rolls the Tide & rises in Klatt’s Top 10 Rankings\nhttps://youtu.be/FkVM19h9Kus","title":"Colorado & Coach Prime take down Nebraska, Texas rolls the Tide & rises in Klatt’s Top 10 Rankings","duration":2870,"channel_id":"UCJn33SOv86632dLg_qVVlcg","author":"The Joel Klatt Show: A College Football Podcast","date":"20230911","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkVM19h9Kus","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkVM19h9Kus/hqdefault.jpg?v=64feb3d4","content":{"View count":215087}}

{"description":"Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances – either side if the interval – and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

Buckle up & get your fingernails ready, cause this one is a wild ride! a few years ago, I had the crazy idea to make a custom food truck of some sort - I just needed the perfect opportunity to do it. So when Cristine and I decided to create a Holo Taco collection together, I thought why not now - let's make a (holo) taco truck!! \n\nSo we took a super old FedEx truck and renovated it into a batty, vampy, ~holographic~ nail polish truck! Once it was finished, we loaded an army of nail polish into the truck and drove it around to several different meet ups around Raleigh. At each location, we gave away some free nail polish, saw lots of great nail art (a decent amount of which is featured in this video), & gave out some other fiendish goodies for you guys to enjoy (think chocolate & boba)!! \n\nThank you to everyone who could make the event!! What do you guys think of our nail polish truck? What should we turn the truck into next??\n\nAnd now, we’ve finally reached the release date of the safiya x Holo Taco collection!! I hope you guys love it as much as we do!

{"description":"Hello, the video practically explains everything.\nGofund me link: https://gofund.me/fd72e8e4\n\nTo summarize, my dad was in a terrible bicycle accident that left him a person with quadriplegia. There was a window to help my dad; if we didn't, he would remain paralyzed for the rest of his life. Because we live in America, every step to get him this vital physical therapy has put my parents in a financially terrifying position. From having to purchase a $50,000 wheelchair-accessible vehicle due to the insurance that they paid $1400 a month for (for many, many years) failing them, and the lack of any form of public transportation or services to help him get to the physical therapy they are now paying out of pocket for, and due to this accident leaving both my parents out of a job... They need your help. Thank you for your time, and we do appreciate anyone who donates.\n\n(We live in times where we as citizens are underpaid, underappreciated, and forced to pay the incredibly high artificially inflated prices greedy \"businessmen\" have made for us, so please hear me when I say, only donate if you feel you can.)","title":"Gofund my Dad","duration":394,"channel_id":"UCvUmwreRrbxeR1mbmojj8fg","author":"SomeThingElseYT","date":"20230909","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvG3U0XRydI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvG3U0XRydI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1102513}}

Now you can build sky-high and sprawl across the map like never before. Why not? Your city is you.\nCities that come alive\nYour decisions shape each citizen's life path, a chain of events that defines who they are. From love and loss to wealth and wellbeing, follow their life's ups and downs.\nA dynamic world\nPick a map to set the climate of your city.

{"description":"When monsters emerge, secrets follow. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters premieres November 17 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/_Monarch\n\nFollowing the thunderous battle between Godzilla and the Titans that leveled San Francisco, and the shocking revelation that monsters are real, “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” tracks two siblings following in their father’s footsteps to uncover their family’s connection to the secretive organization known as Monarch. \n\nClues lead them into the world of monsters and ultimately down the rabbit hole to Army Officer Lee Shaw (played by Kurt Russell and Wyatt Russell), taking place in the 1950s and half a century later where Monarch is threatened by what Shaw knows. \n\nBased on the Monsterverse from #Legendary, and starring Kurt Russell, Wyatt Russell, Anna Sawai, Kiersey Clemons, Ren Watabe, Mari Yamamoto, Anders Holm, Joe Tippett and Elisa Lasowski, this dramatic saga — spanning three generations — reveals buried secrets and the ways that epic, earth-shattering events can reverberate through our lives.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: \nhttps://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube \n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.
