{"description":"Episode 127 of Mike Finnegan's Garage is all about crossing another one off of my bucket list and don't worry, the Cadillac is not taking a back seat to this one. In fact, a week from now I should have the engine for the Caddy, which means more work, more progress, and more videos. In the meantime, I managed to drag this 1963 Chevrolet Split Window Corvette out of my neighbor's basement, where it's been sitting for years. \nAfter the Caddy is running, then it's full steam ahead on turning the Vette into a 6 second street car, using the 711ci Sonny Leonard Hemi as the powerplant. Hope you enjoy this video as much as I had buying and pulling this car home. \n\nWant to support the channel?

I'm stuck in my house recovering from spine surgery and I've missed hanging out with you Spy Ninjas so I figured a Minecraft challenge is the best way to have fun with you all. \n\nToday is my first day of learning how to play Minecraft and the goal is survival of my first night. I need to learn how to build a Minecraft house. Maybe I need to watch a YouTube minecraft house tutorial. Then I'll need to figure out how to put a bed in the house and sleep my first night. Hopefully, I can survive without running into any creepers, hackers, or zombies. \n\nIf I become a true Minecraft Pro, maybe I can play with one of my favorite Minecraft YouTubers.

{"description":"A Day in the Life of a Japanese Game Designer also know in Japan as a Game Planner for a Japanese Development Company.  This is life working in Tokyo in the Japan Game Industry developing games for mobile devices.  It includes the average work day and typical working hours of a Japanese office.  If  you want to learn what it is like working in the Japan game industry then this video should help provide insight on the type of work life and work culture in Japan.  Shuta works as a Lead Game Designer aka Game Planner at Colopl. One of the largest mobile game developers in Japan popular for making casual mobile games like Shironkeo Project, Meow Meow and Star Acres. With about 800 employees in their Tokyo office, their creative teams produce a wide variety of mobile games.  As a Japanese game planner, it‚Äôs important to have strong management and communication skills.  It‚Äôs not enough to be creative and come up with ideas, but a planner must also be able to organize these ideas, create proposals and specification documents in order to effectively communicate their ideas to their teams.  Apparently, it took a total of 7 years of development to complete the game Neko Golf. In fact, the development itself froze after 4 years, but then was later restarted and the team restructured when Shuta joined the team 3 years ago.  For many playing the game, they‚Äôll probably never truly understand how much time went into creating it, but for the team I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a great sense of completing the game. \n\n\"NEKO GOLF -Anime GOLF-\"\nDownload the app here!\n ‚ñΩEnglish\nhttps://colopl.page.link/jpRZ\n‚ñΩÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥(Korean)\nhttps://colopl.page.link/BWEk\n‚ñΩÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá(Chinese)\nhttps://colopl.page.link/gR7A\n\n„Ç∑„É•„Éü„É¨„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„Ç¥„É´„ÉïÊíÆÂΩ±ÂçîÂäõ\nBAGUS ÂÖ≠Êú¨Êú®Â∫ó\n\nWatch more of my Japan Day in the Life videos:\n- https://tokyozebra.com/ditl\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?

MIT engineers had already proved that pine branches can be used as water filters as the thin membranes connecting the straw like xylem filter out 99% of bacteria such as E.coli which make water unsafe to drink ( https://meche.mit.edu/news-media/mit-engineers-make-filters-tree-branches-purify-drinking-water ). Taking this concept, I used a type of cane in the forest and bent them into hook shapes, tying them in place with vine. Then I put dirty water into a raised pot and siphoned clean water from it into a lower collection pot. Initially some sap comes (which is also harmless to drink) out but then water flows through the stem. It does take a while for it to work but the process can be sped up by adding multiple canes working in parallel. The water that came through is clean and I was able to drink it without ill effect. After a few days the canes clog up and need replacing though one cane lasted longer than the others for some reason. Also in this video, I test the effectiveness of filtering water through a clay pot submerged in a creek, the ceramic walls acting as a filter for the creek water. Both methods seem to work but the clay pot method is more useable and needs less maintenance. But, the cane siphon would be better if no clay pots were available, simply filtering water from a puddle into a lower collection container such as a folded leaf.\n\n00:00- Making filter/siphon\n02:12- Using filter/siphon\n03:53- Alternative pot filter\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Each second the breath is channeled directly at an enemy will deal bonus damage, which is improved by the amount of Stardust that's been collected. This ability collects Stardust if the target is a champion.\n\n00:21 ASTRAL FLIGHT\nAurelion Sol flies over terrain in a targeted direction. While in this state, he can cast other abilities. Breath of Light no longer has a cooldown or maximum channel duration and deals increased damage while flying.\nAstral Flight's remaining cooldown is reduced whenever an enemy champion dies after being recently damaged by Aurelion Sol.\nStardust increases Astral Flight's maximum range.\n\n00:29 SINGULARITY\nAurelion Sol summons a black hole, damaging enemies and slowly pulling them toward its center. This ability grants Stardust each time an enemy dies within the black hole and for each second an enemy champion is caught inside it.\nThe center of the black hole executes enemies who are below a certain percentage of their maximum health. Stardust increases Singularity's size as well as the execution threshold.\n\n00:36 FALLING STAR - R\nFalling Star: Aurelion Sol crashes a star into the earth. This impact deals magic damage and stuns enemies while also granting Stardust for each enemy champion it hits. Gathering enough Stardust transforms Aurelion Sol's next Falling Star into The Skies Descend.\nThe Skies Descend: Aurelion Sol drags a giant star down from the heavens with an increased impact zone and increased damage, knocking up enemies rather than stunning them. A shockwave then spreads from the edge of the impact zone, which damages and slows the enemies it hits.\nStardust increases the impact area of both Falling Star and The Skies Descend.","title":"Aurelion Sol Gameplay Update | League of Legends","duration":60,"channel_id":"UC0NwzCHb8Fg89eTB5eYX17Q","author":"SkinSpotlights","date":"20230105","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ZhpfZgfCM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Y2ZhpfZgfCM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1429607}}

The 4070 Ti is, and never will be, ‚Äú3x better‚Äù than the RTX 3090 Ti -- despite NVIDIA‚Äôs misleading marketing to the contrary. It is hardly better than a 3080 -- and sometimes not even that -- and its positioning forces NVIDIA to choose between two bad options: One, they could call it a ‚Äú4080‚Äù and implicitly state that there‚Äôs been no generational improvement between 80-class cards for 2 years while increasing the price by $200, or two, they could call it a ‚Äú4070 Ti‚Äù and tell customers that the 70-class silicon is now 60% more expensive than 2 years ago. Neither option is good, and it was too late to fully cancel the product by the time they realized their mistakes. \n\nBenchmarks include ray tracing, rasterization, thermals, power, power transients, and more.

{"description":"In this Mumbo Jumbo Minecraft, I put my new Max Spec M1 Ultra Apple Mac Studio that cost $7000 to the test, with Minecraft. Can you play Minecraft on a Mac? I guess this is the ultimate answer to that question. This M1 Ultra Mac Studio with 20 cores and 64 GPU cores gets tested with Minecraft Single Player worlds, Minecraft TNT explosions and even gets trialed on the Hermitcraft server. \n\nWHY DID I GET A MAC STUDIO?\nI'm not just a Minecraft YouTuber. I'm a filmmaker who works on commercials, narrative and documentaries. I also love to travel, and be out in remote places to shoot photos, hike and explore.\nI wanted a desktop powerhouse that could fit into a single flight case and be transported to any location in the world, allowing me to live and work wherever I want. \n\nThe system needed to:\n1. Run Minecraft at a good enough level to record videos\n2. Handle colour graded cinema camera files, and edit with them no dropped frames.\n3. Have a large number of high speed I/O ports to deal with multiple large data transfers at once. \n4. Be silent for recording audio in potentially small places (This is what ruled out most gaming laptops!)\n5. Fit in a flight case, with the system, display, and flight case combination weighing under 20KG to be within the weight allowance for checked luggage on flights.\n6. Be durable enough to be thrown on a plane, in the back of a van, in my backpack. \n\nFilming channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatMumboJumbo2\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialmumbo/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatMumboJumbo","title":"Minecraft vs $7000 Apple Mac Studio","duration":625,"channel_id":"UChFur_NwVSbUozOcF_F2kMg","author":"Mumbo Jumbo","date":"20230103","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qUMtTcIWpM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/3qUMtTcIWpM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":813576}}

It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet¬≠to¬≠be¬≠dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms. #Roblox‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã #Numberskull‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã","title":"Phoenix Awakened Made Me INVINCIBLE...
