{"description":"Welcome Back ladies and gents to the worst skyrim build ever created! It is perfectly balanced because today we have done todd howard proud by playing skyrim the true way Bethesda intended!  Say hello to the worst underpowered and overpowered character build the world has ever seen. Gone are the days of OP stealth archer Skyrim characters. Say hello to the new negative Armor rating heavy builds that can deal infinite damage upon taking damage but usually can only take 1 hit before they are defeated by a level 1 wolf. We have built perfectly balanced skyrim forks that 1 hit dragons and gods. Whilst building skyrim necromancy characters that can raise an army of the dead. But today we build a noodle that whilst having infinite health will still receive infinite damage. A Perfect Counter. So let us break skyrim together! And provided this video does well I think its time the spiffing brit takes on skyrim multiplayer! \n\nso it's time for me to flex my exploit skills and break the game with infinite armor. My power is unstoppable and I will defeat this impossible challenge with all of my skyrim illegal experience to discover if this game is broken or can you beat perfectly balanced gameplay! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced game series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts.

{"description":"Mac Jones is entering his second season in the NFL, after making the playoffs his rookie year. However, his growth may be at question. According to New England Patriots beat writer Mike Giraldi, the QB is 'struggling' more than last summer with changes to the team's offensive staff. Colin Cowherd explains why he is concerned for Jones, along with how Bill Belichick will continue to struggle in his second season without Tom Brady. Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa and New York Giants QB Daniel Jones are entering their first seasons under new head coaches. While both QBs are under pressure this season, which one will have the better year based off of practice footage across social media?

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Feeling Untethered \n02:13 Start the South Island Road Trip\n03:26 Flea Bay - Banks Peninsula\n04:26 NZ Fur Seal Encounter\n06:39 Surfshark.deals/WYNNS\n07:58 Akaroa Head - Banks Peninsula\n11:37 What's Next - Our Loose Travel Plan\n13:25 New Catamaran Update - WHEN & WHERE\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"WE’RE IN A WEIRD PLACE (+boat update & what's next)","duration":928,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220807","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YrJVpTtY6g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4YrJVpTtY6g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":231783}}

{"description":"Amy Rose thought her transformation was going to be the catalyst for a whirlwind romance with Sonic the Hedgehog. But, she let her Sonic mania get the better of her, which resulted in a Sonic vs Amy showdown. So, it doesn’t look like Sonic and Amy will ever be a thing now. In lieu of the opportunity to now call herself Mrs. Sonic Hedgehog, Amy is turning to the one person she knows will help her in her time of need: Miles Tails Prower.\n\nAfter making Sonic boom, Tails is well aware that Amy needs some guidance… and a shovel. After all, what are friends for? So, off to the woods they go to try and salvage this Sonic exe situation. But, it’s here where Amy learns of the truth about this Sonic origins story. Or, truthfully, this Tails origin story. To the two-tailed fox, this has just been one big Sonic game. One big game with his best friends.\n\nProduced by Tom Jenkins and Ben Michael\nWritten by Jason Dewey and Ben Michael\n\nPre Production by Ben \"Wonchop\" Smallman\n\nRough Animation by Esau \"LDranzer\" A.
