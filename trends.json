{"description":"The end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema‚Äôs most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they‚Äôve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who‚Äôs fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything‚Äîand everyone‚Äîthat Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011‚Äôs Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn‚Äôt know was that Reyes‚Äô son, Dante (Aquaman‚Äôs Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante‚Äôs plot will scatter Dom‚Äôs family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante‚Äôs vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar¬Æ winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn‚Äôt hold the same fondness for Dom‚Äôs crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom‚Äôs past; and legendary Oscar¬Æ winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia‚Äôs Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga\n\n#FASTX","title":"FAST X | Official Trailer","duration":222,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32RAq6JzY-w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32RAq6JzY-w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":30505975}}

{"description":"On June 16, worlds collide. Watch the official trailer now for The Flash ‚Äì only in theaters. #TheFlashMovie \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù directed by Andy Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero‚Äôs first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in ‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian‚Ä¶ albeit not the one he‚Äôs looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry‚Äôs only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (‚ÄúBullet Train,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äù), Ron Livingston (‚ÄúLoudermilk,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù), Maribel Verd√∫ (‚ÄúElite,‚Äù ‚ÄúY tu mam√° tambi√©n‚Äù), Kiersey Clemons (‚ÄúZack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League,‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetheart‚Äù), Antje Traue (‚ÄúKing of Ravens,‚Äù ‚ÄúMan of Steel‚Äù) and Michael Keaton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù) and Michael Disco (‚ÄúRampage,‚Äù ‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (‚ÄúBirds of Prey,‚Äù ‚ÄúBumblebee‚Äù), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (‚ÄúDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming‚Äù) and Joby Harold (‚ÄúTransformers: Rise of the Beasts,‚Äù ‚ÄúArmy of the Dead‚Äù), based on characters from DC. The executive producers \nare Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Suicide Squad‚Äù), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (‚ÄúIT Chapter Two,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù), editors Jason Ballantine (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù) and Paul Machliss (‚ÄúThe Gentlemen,‚Äù ‚ÄúBaby Driver‚Äù), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (‚ÄúDoctor Strange,‚Äù ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äù); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch \n(‚ÄúThe Invisible Man,‚Äù the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, ‚ÄúThe Flash.‚Äù It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

{"description":"Turqu√≠a es un pa√≠s de terremotos, pero Italia, Grecia y los Balcanes tambi√©n. Solo desde el a√±o 2000, en la pen√≠nsula de Anat√≥lia se han registrado 18 terremotos por encima del grado 5 de magnitud. En Italia central, entre 2009 y 2016, se han registrado tres terremotos que han arrasado sus respectivas comarcas.\n\n¬øPero por qu√© en la regi√≥n del Mediterr√°neo hay tantos terremotos? La raz√≥n es que en esta zona se encuentran los bordes de contacto de tres placas tect√≥nicas. La placa euroasi√°tica, la ar√°biga y la africana. En este v√≠deo explicativo veremos como a placas africana y ar√°biga est√°n empujando hacia la placa euroasi√°tica. Estos movimientos de las capas profunda de la Tierra provocan que una placa se monte por encima de la otra, provocando los terremotos y la formaci√≥n de los Alpes y los Pirineos.\n\nDesde el sur, la costa de √Åfrica se mueve empujando las Baleares, C√≥rcega y Cerde√±a contra Italia. Al otro lado, la placa ar√°biga tambi√©n se separa de √Åfrica y empuja hacia norte, creando las monta√±as del C√°ucaso. Este empuje no se acabar√° hasta que el Mediterr√°neo no se haya cerrado por el desplazamiento conjunto de la placa africana y ar√°biga.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:29 ¬øPor qu√© hay tantos terremotos en el Mediterr√°neo?\n02:14 As√≠ est√° hecho el interior de la Tierra\n04:50 El futuro del Mediterr√°neo\n06:14 El planeta en 50 millones de a√±os\n07:10 La gram√°tica de los terremotos\n\n#terremotos #turquia #mediterraneo","title":"El terremoto de Turqu√≠a es una monta√±a que est√° naciendo en el Mediterr√°neo","duration":494,"channel_id":"UCY2hu_NT5NDbBU-HGxgqMuA","author":"El Confidencial","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzdXgo2J_dc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/BzdXgo2J_dc/hqdefault.webp?v=63e67001","content":{"View count":1458324}}

It‚Äôs why in just one year‚Äôs time, he‚Äôs already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80‚Äôs hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song ‚ÄúNever Comin‚Äô Home‚Äù amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, ‚ÄúFall In Love‚Äù, ‚ÄúRock and A Hard Place‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWhere It Ends‚Äù. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n¬© 2023 Warner Music Nashville LLC / 2023 Elektra Records\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #FixnToBreak #TikTok","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Fix'n To Break (Lyric Video)","duration":231,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhxEO5I-BCQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lhxEO5I-BCQ/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":208095}}

{"description":"In the early hours of 06 February 2023, south eastern Turkey and northern areas of Syria were hit by a powerful and destructive quake. A second one followed only hours later, as well as a series of after shocks. Far away to the west, Istanbul was unaffected; but Turkey‚Äôs largest metropolis, lies close to the North Anatolian Fault Zone, one of the most active in the world. Seismologists say the city could be hit at anytime as this documentary, shot in 2019, illustrates. \n\nMarco Bohnhoff is from the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. We accompany him and his team on their way to the Princes Islands in the Sea of Marmara just to the south of Istanbul. With the help of several measuring stations, the scientist wants to develop a new type of early warning system for earthquakes in the region. In a best case scenario, it would send warning signals hours or even days in advance. The Anatolian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet directly below the Sea of Marmara, making the risk of earthquakes particularly high. In the case of a big tremor, Turkish disaster management authorities forecast at least 80,000 deaths. In the last few years, the city has been trying to become more earthquake-resistant, for example by tightening building regulations. However, the Chamber of Civil Engineers is skeptical, with chairman Cemal G√∂kce stressing: Not everything that is new is earthquake-proof. Seismologists such as Marco Bohnhoff, as well as disaster prevention experts and engineers, are working flat out to prepare Istanbul for future natural disasters by constructing special buildings and improving forecasting. \n\n[This documentary was filmed in 2019.] \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Eight of the world‚Äôs top-10 golfers are in the field, including world No. 2 Scottie Scheffler and world No. 3 Jon Rahm. Rahm currently leads in the FedExCup Standings and has won four of his last six starts combined on the PGA TOUR and DP World Tour. Meanwhile, Scheffler is looking to become the first golfer since Hideki Matsuyama (2016-17) to win back-to-back titles at TPC Scottsdale. Sam Ryder returns to TPC Scottsdale after making a hole-in-one on the famous 16th hole in 2022. Other names to look out for include Shane Lowry, Collin Morikawa and Patrick Cantlay, who returns after a playoff loss last season.  \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Highlights | Round 1 | WM Phoenix Open | 2023","duration":856,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfY6Ypdr6Xo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lfY6Ypdr6Xo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":342094}}

{"description":"They‚Äôre bad to the bone. Watch the #StraysMovie NSFW trailer now. In Theaters June 9th.\n\nhttps://www.strays.movie/ \n\nThey say a dog is a man‚Äôs best friend, but what if the man is a total dirtbag? In that case, it might be time for some sweet revenge, doggy style. \n\nWhen Reggie (Will Ferrell), a na√Øve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte; The Last Man on Earth, Nebraska), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose. \n\nBut once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Oscar¬Æ winner Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is. \n \nDetermined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug‚Äôs pals‚ÄîMaggie (Isla Fisher; Now You See Me, Wedding Crashers), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner‚Äôs new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park; Always Be My Maybe, Aquaman), an anxious Great Dane who‚Äôs stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal‚Äîtogether hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home ‚Ä¶ and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. (Hint: It‚Äôs not his foot). \n\nA subversion of the dog movies we know and love, Strays, directed by Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) and written by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal), is a hilarious, R-rated, live-action comedy about the complications of love, the importance of great friendships, and the unexpected virtues of couch humping. \n\nFeaturing a powerhouse comedic supporting cast‚Äîincluding Grammy winner Josh Gad (Beauty and the Beast), Harvey Guill√©n (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish), Emmy nominee Rob Riggle (The Hangover), Brett Gelman (Stranger Things), Jamie Demetriou (The Afterparty), and Emmy nominee Sofia Vergara (Modern Family)‚ÄîStrays is produced by Picturestart founder and CEO Erik Feig (Luckiest Girl Alive, Cha Cha Real Smooth), by Louis Leterrier (director Fast X, The Clash of the Titans), by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal) and by Lord Miller partners Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) and Lord Miller President of Film Aditya Sood (The Martian, Cocaine Bear). \n \nThe film is executive produced by Jessica Switch, Nikki Baida and Julia Hammer.","title":"Strays | Official Trailer [HD]","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230208","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwOLKTbCUw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/BzwOLKTbCUw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":436824}}
{"description":"From clothes to tech, why is everything so poorly made?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nMaybe you‚Äôve noticed: In the past 10 years everything we buy from clothes to technology has gotten just a little bit worse. Sweaters are more likely to tear. Phones are more likely to break. Smart toasters and TVs burn out and die after only a few years. It might seem like consumer products just aren‚Äôt built to last anymore. What‚Äôs going on?\n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately!), part of the problem is us. For decades, we‚Äôve been conditioned to buy, buy, buy, and today it‚Äôs normal for many consumers to shop for new clothes at least once a month. In order to keep up, many companies have to prioritize making things in the fastest and least expensive way possible. To do that, they cut corners with materials and labor. In turn, quality suffers, which leaves consumers with a lot of crappy things.\n\nThe story with technology is a little different. And the biggest difference is that while no one in fashion is saying you‚Äôre not allowed to sew a new button on a shirt, many tech companies have actually made it impossible to repair their products. \n\nThe good news is consumers have a surprising amount of control over this situation. Watch the video to learn more.\n\n\nCheck out the original article from Izzie Ramirez on Vox.com: https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23529587/consumer-goods-quality-fast-fashion-technology\n\nRepair.org is Gay Gordon Byrne‚Äôs association that‚Äôs fighting for your right to repair. \n\nFor more on the right to repair bill in New York State there are some articles here:\nhttps://www.engadget.com/new-york-right-to-repair-law-kathy-hochul-184654713.html\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2022/12/29/23530733/right-to-repair-law-new-york-tech-hochul-oems-parts\n\nWhile I didn‚Äôt spend much time on Fast Fashion for this piece, I did love these articles:\nhttps://catapult.co/stories/haley-e-d-houseman-clothing-costs-labor-materials-handmade-homemade-factory-made\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/fast-cheap-out-of-control-inside-rise-of-shein/\n\nThis article from Vogue did a great job breaking down what things actually costs:\nhttps://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-the-right-price-for-fashion\n\nI also highly recommend following Cora Harrington (@lingerie_addict) and Derek Guy (@dieworkwear) on twitter for more hot takes on the fashion industry. \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"And why the US and China are fighting over silicon in the first place.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn October 2022, the Biden administration placed a large-scale ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to China. They also implemented a series of other rules that prevents China from making these chips on their own. These chips are used in everyday technology, like our mobile phones and computers. They‚Äôre also crucial to military and intelligence systems, which is one of the main reasons they're at the center of a feud between the United States and China. \n\nMicrochips were first invented in the US in the 1950s, after which their use rapidly expanded worldwide. Since then, the supply chain for these chips has grown and spread to include countries in Europe and Asia. And while some countries have caught up to the US's edge in making these advanced chips, China still falls far behind despite multiple attempts to gain an advantage.\n\nWatch the latest episode of Vox Atlas to understand why China is losing a new cold war with the US over microchips.\n\nSources and further reading: \n\nWe found this book written by Chris Miller very helpful for understanding the history of chip development in the US and the foreign policy behind its competition and feud with China: \n\nChip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002 \n\nThis book gave us great context on China‚Äôs efforts to acquire foreign technology: \n\nChinese Industrial Espionage by Anna Puglisi\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Books-Anna-B-Puglisi/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AAnna+B.+Puglisi\n\nArticles like this by Chien-Huei Wu helped us learn more about how much the US replies on east asian countries for successful technology:\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2022/05/east-asian-firms-are-critical-to-americas-semiconductor-success/\n\nReporting by Bloomberg helped us understand major IP theft cases related to semiconductor chips: \nhttps://cset.georgetown.edu/article/engineer-who-fled-charges-of-stealing-chip-technology-in-us-now-thrives-in-china/\n\nAn excellent report for more detail:\nGregory Allen, CSIS https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Last week we received an invitation to Buckingham Palace to meet the King of England, and I got the chance to talk to him about Korea and what it means to me.\n\nMore than 20 years ago some Korean middle-schoolers went out of their way to welcome me into their friendship group. They made me feel at home and like I belonged, in a place where I had felt like an outsider.\n\n10 years ago I went out with my best mate Ollie to talk to people on the streets of London about Korea. And since then we‚Äôve had the privilege to introduce Korean culture and food to my friends, family and the world.\n\nThis was truly a surreal experience, and was an honour that we never would have received without all of you, so from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.\n\n--\n\nÏßÄÎÇú Ï£º, Ï†ÄÌù¨Îäî Î≤ÑÌÇπÏóÑ Í∂ÅÏ†ÑÏóê Ï¥àÎåÄÎ•º Î∞õÏïÑ ÏòÅÍµ≠Ïùò Íµ≠ÏôïÏùÑ ÎßåÎÇòÎµê Ïàò ÏûàÎäî ÌäπÎ≥ÑÌïú Í≤ΩÌóòÏùÑ ÌïòÍ≤å ÎêêÏñ¥Ïöî.

{"description":"Hogwarts Legacy reviewed by Travis Northup on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.\nIn nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I‚Äôve always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It‚Äôs certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn‚Äôt come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me.\n\n#HogwartsLegacy #HogwartsLegacyReview","title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review","duration":630,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230206","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6dZxoob8CY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6dZxoob8CY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2644749}}
