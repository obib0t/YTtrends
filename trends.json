For weeks.\nWhile supernovae are the engines of creation, forging the elements that enable life, they also burn sterile whole regions of galaxies.

{"description":"England and Iran faced off in the World Cup. Jude Bellingham scored in the 35th minute. Bellingham is only 19 years old and is partaking in his World Cup debut this season. England’s Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka found the net for a second and third time in the 43rd and 45th minutes to increase England’s lead to 3-0. The scoring didn’t stop there as Bukayo Saka would score again in the 62nd minute. Iran showed some life and notched their first goal of the World Cup in the 65th minute via Mehdi Taremi. Jack Grealish added a goal which marked six total for England. Iran would add a penalty kick later and the score would end up 6-2 in favor of England.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #England \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

{"description":"Germany and Japan go head-to-head in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In an intense first half Germany overpowered Japan on ball control. After multiple attempts on goal they capitalized on a penalty kick after Shuichi Gonda fouls David Raum in the 31’ followed by a Ilkay Gundogan goal. Germany had almost secured another goal but it was overturned by VAR. Japan had chances but they weren’t able to land a finishing blow before the end of the half. The second half was a different story. Japan came out with more aggression. They netted two goals by Takuma Asano and Ritsu Doan. Japan went on to win 2-1.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Japan #Germany \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

{"description":"Spain and Costa Rica played in their first game of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Spain got off to a fast start, thanks to Dani Olmo's beautiful touch. Olmo helped Spain score their 100th goal in World Cup history, joining the likes of Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy, and France. Marcos Asensio and Ferran Torres added goals in the 21st and 31st minutes to extend Spain's lead to 3-0 before halftime. After the break, Ferran Torres continued his impressive performance as he bagged a brace in the 54th minute. Spain continued its dominance, thanks to goals from Gavi, Carlos Soler, and Álvaro Morata in 74th, 90th, and 90' +2' minutes to defeat Costa Rica 7-0.

{"description":"This will allow you to quickly and easily unlock all of the community event rewards using an infinite donations glitch.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/z2imca/\n\nSpanish:\n Hola chicos, estáis aquí por un error de donaciones infinitas. Para progresar en el evento de la comunidad, puede donar coordenadas del tesoro. Puede generar coordenadas de la nada. Necesitas la ventaja de bajo un estandarte y el rumoreado mapa del tesoro en el mapa estelar para que esto funcione. Ten algunos fragmentos de mapa contigo.\nColoca un costoso mapa del tesoro. Entonces dona tus coordenadas al evento. Tendrás 0 coordenadas pero podemos hacer algunas. Cambia entre tu mapa rumoreado y tu mapa caro repetidamente.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone.

He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.

{"description":"Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 | The Bloody Lie (2022)\n\nFor more than a decade Elizabeth Holmes spun a despicable bloody lie. She told the world she’d invented a medical miracle. It was a machine which, with a tiny drop of blood, could almost instantly diagnose myriad diseases. Holmes promised to revolutionise healthcare, and in doing so fooled many wealthy investors. It led to her becoming a darling of Silicon Valley and an inspirational billionaire. But when whistle-blowers started questioning her claims, Holmes’ fairytale, along with her company Theranos, was destroyed. Earlier this year, Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty of fraud. Now it’s judgement day as she discovers her punishment.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #BloxFruits","title":"Race V4 Official Guide  | Blox Fruits (Part 1)","duration":178,"channel_id":"UCH-hRvGG-A2zQDDPF-kIDpA","author":"Axiore","date":"20221122","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7eoNh23Jew","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A7eoNh23Jew/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":383179}}

{"description":"In this video I'm restoring a very small rusty and deadlocked Gressel bench vise. Its jaws are just 80mm wide. My friend has found this tiny vise on the steel waste and I thought this would be cool for a video.\nOn first sight it was only seized and had some additional holes. When disassembling I also quickly realized that something on the half round part was not right and after sandblasting I also saw pretty deep damages near the jaws. To disassemble the movable jaw I quickly made a tool to open the vise. There's also a video about that on my second channel „my mechanics insights“, link below.\nI closed the two additional holes with slight press fit plugs and closed the gap with welding. After filing the welds flush the two holes completely disappeared.\nThere was a bit of a mess with the threads at the half round part, so I decided to close them all with very tight press fitted plugs and cut two new M4 threads. That worked very well and these plugs will never ever come out again.\nOn the other deep damages I decided to weld up new material with cast iron stick welding rod. That was my very first time stick welding. Was a bit tricky to get used to it, but the end result turned out very well. I was able to file and sand all surfaces perfectly clean afterwards.\nI decided to paint this vise in a nice red (RAL3011) with white highlights on the lettering.\nAs the spindle only had very little rust, I was able to clean it very nicely with rust remover, wire brush, some sandpaper and Scotch Brite.\nFor the remaining parts I first removed the deep pitting, removed the sharp edges, recut the threads and then sandblasted them to remove the remaining rust and make a nice and even texture on the sanded surfaces. To darken all these parts I used the method of hot bluing.\nAs the rough pattern of the jaws were in pretty good condition I decided to restore them. After a night in the rust remover and a bit of wire brushing the jaws already looked pretty good. I also had to bend them as they were a bit out of shape. As they're just case hardened this worked very well. Then I sanded all the surfaces clean, chamfered all edges and applied cold bluing to darken them.\nIn the end I'm very happy how this little bench vise has turned out. In my opinion the red looks very nice together with the black steel parts and the shiny sanded surfaces and the white details of the lettering are just the cherry on top.\n\nI hope you like my work and the video. \n\nLink to the vise opener tool video:\nhttps://youtu.be/VXvMa_n3zls\n\nHuge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and especially to:\n\nAdel AlSaffar\nAlex McGeorge\nAlfonso Baz\nAlistair Moor\nAmar.k\nAnthony Eufemio\nArron Metcalf\nBendurion\nBrenna Redpath\nChris walter\nDavid Barker\nEdward Conway\nEmbiss\nHaitham Al Zir\nisaac\njames lowe\nJean Ceppi\nJohn Shebanow\nJoseph Kamps\nJosh Ledford\nJosh Wasserman\nJoshua Bentley\nJoshua Scher\nKar Marsten\nKerem Yollu\nLambda GPU Workstations\nLordPi\nMellissa Marcus\nMonte Gibbs\nNoLoneSurvivor\nPat Thrasher\nPeter Riddett\npotokslow\nRobert Brindley\nSophieHDLM\nSteve Bothe\nStevenVR\nTyler Carruth\nVaushVidya\nVickie Bligh\nVince Valenti\nWill Black\nXavier Carbel\nYale Baker\nYuri Zapuchlak\nAdam Holtzclaw\nAlex Findlay\nAlipasha Sadri\nAndrew Phillips\nArni Bjorgvinsson\nBenjamin Gouveia\nbizzaropanda\nBonnie Williamson\nBrett Pitts\nBrian Hoerl\nChad Bryant\nCharles Copenhaver\nCrystal Cash\nDamien Fuller-Sutherland\nDaniel Trejo\nDaniel Varga\nDave Hardware\nDavid Ebert\nDavid P Hruska\nDavid Powell\nGrant Daniel\nHaley McFadden\nHard_Boiled\nJack Curry\njake meckley\nJason Koi\nJeff Smith\nJeremy Cole\nJohan Vergeer\nJoël Franusic\nJustin Blackwood\nKen Rosso\nKevin Robinson\nKurt Gazow\nL Rlta\nLina Machina\nMarc Cerisier\nMarc Staedelin\nMary Casella\nMellissa McConnell\nMicheal Bier\nMichael Lamp\nMossy_Forrest\nPeter Cyprian\nPeter Read\nRebecca Miller\nRegis Vincent\nRob\nRobert Galyen\nSarah Langlais\nScott Marshall\nStefan Kronander\nSteven Michalcewicz\nSuiros\nSvenja Kuckla\nThanny\nTim Holt\nTom Wallace\nTrevor Kam\nTucker Ifft\nVictoria Emmenegger\nWilliam\n\n\nMy camera:\nPanasonic HC-VX11\n\n\nIf you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

{"description":"Edited by: SimplyAJ (http://youtube.com/SimplyAJ)\n\nComplete Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtzT_jAav1xg5QU5A46bAtuJEV6b0KPUV\n\n-Rules and Explanations-\nRules: (1) Only use the one Pokémon in Battle, others for HMs are fine. (2) No Items in battle (3) No Glitches* (4) Set Mode (5) No saving in the Elite Four (6) No evasion moves\n\n*Badge Boost \"Glitch\" Explanation: When you collect odd numbered badges the game boosts a stat by 12.5%. Brock gives ATK, Surge DEF, Koga SPE, and Blaine SPC (in game text is wrong). When any of your stats are modified (even by you using a move like Withdraw, or your opponent using Leer) the badge boosts are re-applied. So If you use Swords Dance, you also gain *an additional* 12.5% in Speed/Defence/Special (on top of the 12.5% you were supposed to be getting). When you level up, the game corrects this error, and only the non-glitch 12.5% remains. Because of how difficult it is to avoid, I've allowed for it to be exploited, since opponents will spam Leer/Growl anyways, and this way battles are less random. Red/Blue are extremely buggy, so there's always going to be *some* glitches present, and because of how unavoidable this one is, it is allowed in runs, and considered more like a special Generation 1 mechanic as opposed to a glitch.","title":"How Fast can you beat Pokemon Red/Blue with just a Snorlax?","duration":1919,"channel_id":"UC5HolAcNQGGVQ6gY8QWuoKg","author":"Jrose11","date":"20221120","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVMeCWM-Fy0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/iVMeCWM-Fy0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":177269}}
