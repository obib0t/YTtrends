It released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the series. It will be the ninth installment in the God of War series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War.\n\nRagnar√∂k is set in the world of Norse mythology but expands upon the previous game's narrative, with an even greater focus on exploration and open-world gameplay. While God of War (2018) allowed the player to access six of the nine realms of Norse mythology, Ragnar√∂k's expanded focus sees the player exploring each of the nine realms, including the new additions of Svartalfheim, the industrial abode of the Dwarves; Vanaheim, the lush home of the Vanir gods; and Asgard, the golden land of the √Üsir gods. Midgard, the primary realm of the 2018 installment, is heavily featured but is now a frigid wasteland, dramatically changed by Fimbulwinter, a three-year long winter that began upon the conclusion of the previous game. The Lake of the Nine, previously navigable by means of a boat in the previous game, is now frozen over. Svartalfheim is explorable to the same degree as Midgard was in the previous game. Alfheim, Helheim, and Niflheim all return, with an expanded focus and character exploration.\n\nTaking place three years following the events of the previous game, Fimbulwinter, a great winter that spans three summers, is drawing to a close which will begin the prophesied Ragnar√∂k. Kratos and his teenage son Atreus begin to traverse the nine realms to seek out a means to prevent Ragnar√∂k while attempting to uncover answers behind Atreus' identity as Loki. Their journey will lead them to T√Ωr, the Norse God of War. Their conflict will lie with Thor, the Norse God of Thunder.\n\n#godofwarragnarok #godofwar","title":"GOD OF WAR RAGNAROK PS5 Walkthrough Gameplay Part 1 - INTRO (FULL GAME)","duration":3455,"channel_id":"UCpqXJOEqGS-TCnazcHCo0rA","author":"theRadBrad","date":"20221108","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xy4NNqX_ZU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/0xy4NNqX_ZU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1373605}}

{"description":"Karlous Bernard Miller is an American comedian, actor and rapper. He began his comedy career in Atlanta, Georgia and is widely known for his successful podcast/comedy tour The 85 South show, along with being a cast member on MTV's comedy improv series, Wild 'n Out, and his notorious \"Wildstyle\" battles with fellow cast members DC Young Fly and Chico Bean.\n\n\nIn this interview Marco greets Karlous and Karlous is immediately apprehensive of Marco and let‚Äôs Marco know. Marco starts with a softball question, ‚ÄúWho is Karlous Miller?‚Äù  Marco expounds upon Karlous‚Äôs answer and reveals that the production team found out that Karlous is big on relationships. The production team claims to know Karlous‚Äôs baby mama and takes out his phone and proves it. Karlous immediately changes his mood as the atmosphere tenses. Marco redirects the questions to women‚Äôs body parts and Karlous gives his opinions. The production team continues to make noise in the background. Marco goes into ‚Äúfact or cap‚Äù and Karlous reveals he hears old people in his head. Marco is interrupted by the crew who are ignorant to who the guest is. Marco has an impromptu meeting with his staff as he is frustrated with the line of questions. Marco asks about Karlous being a Donald Trump supporter and the staff takes exception as they try to prove to Karlous and Marco that there are facts. Karlous watches as the staff and Marco argue on the set.  A staff member exits as Marco chases him and all hell breaks loose as other staff bring a monkey on set and Karlous reacts. Marco and the producer argue off set and Karlous is astonished at the monkey and hysteria. Karlous talks to one of the staff members and is baffled at the unprofessional antics and a monkey being put on his lap. The staff brings out another monkey and things get hairy.

LMNT has been a huge supporter of the town, I drink it basically every day, so I hope you'll check it out!\n\nThis was a HUGE few weeks at Cerro Gordo. Finally. Finally, after nearly 2 years of battling concrete, the hotel for the American Hotel is DONE. Once again, we found ourselves in a place where no concrete companies would bring their trucks to our town. It was too dangerous, and there were easier jobs elsewhere. \n\nSo instead of sitting back and letting someone else dictate whether a dream happened or not, we got to WORK. In the end, we broke open and mixed 1,500 ninety pound bags of concrete and got the job done. It was one of the craziest few days up here at Cerro Gordo. \n\nI have to give a HUGE shoutout to everyone who has helped out these past few weekends to make this possible - Aaron C, Scotty, Trevor, Phil, Pat, Craig, Dave, Jim, Marty, Aaron S, Hans, Christy, Paul, Daniel, Sabin, Elias, Damien, Richard, Andrew, Victoria, Chris K, Richie, Juan, Freddy, Elliot, Corbin, Jeff, Connor, James, Travis, Jake, Olmo, Brian, and many more!!

{"description":"Welcome back to skyrim! Where today we set out on a second attempt of an impossible challenge! Can you beat the survive 100 days in skyrim hardcore challenge? The rules are simple, Legendary difficulty skyrim with survival mode but the added twist that you are not allowed to equip any Armor or weapons. This is the hardest possible challenge skyrim can offer. You are effectively playing at 1 hp and almost anything will kill you and fail the run. Ontop of that in survival mode you must eat and sleep similarly to an indie survival game. You must also balance temperatures which in the cold northern lands of skyrim is rather impossible. \n\nMod Pack Used: https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/jqd9zz\n\nSo sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or surviving 100 days of skyrim hardcore is a task that is simply too impossible for this pro exploiter!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage.

{"description":"NBC News has learned new details about the moment San Francisco police officers arrived at the home of Paul Pelosi during an alleged assault.\r\n\r\nA top ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding fresh answers from the U.S. Capitol Police about security failures that led to a brutal attack on Pelosi‚Äôs husband last week, questioning the embattled agency about whether it can keep lawmakers and their families safe.\r\n\r\nHouse Administration Committee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., sent a four-page letter to Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger on Wednesday, saying the attack on Paul Pelosi raises ‚Äúsignificant questions about security protections for Members of Congress.‚Äù The man who beat Paul Pelosi with a hammer was looking for Nancy Pelosi and later told police that he wanted to hold her hostage and break her kneecaps to make a political point, authorities said.\r\n\r\nThe searing letter lays out a series of questions for Manger and orders the agency to lay out its plans for protecting lawmakers and their families, including how they are interacting with other law enforcement agencies, how officers are trained for such situations and whether there are special plans in place to protect lawmakers in the presidential line of succession, as Pelosi is.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Lofgren, whose panel oversees the Capitol Police, comes as the beleaguered agency is still trying to rebuild after the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, when hundreds of former President Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters overwhelmed officers and more than 100 were injured. Threats to lawmakers have skyrocketed in recent years ‚Äî almost 10,000 threats were investigated last year ‚Äî and the agency has struggled to protect lawmakers, their families and the Capitol campus with limited resources.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Police issued a statement Wednesday saying they will ‚Äúfast track‚Äù the work they had already been doing to protect members outside of Washington. #WakeUpCLT \r\n\r\nREAD MORE: https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/nation-world/pelosi-attack-capitol-police-safety-concerns/507-6d89c6f2-cfbc-4473-8bc7-950aa48516a9","title":"New details revealed in brutal attack on Paul Pelosi","duration":131,"channel_id":"UC-RxXi2Xws6Uk22vp-sLbGA","author":"WCNC","date":"20221104","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTS1bPKiTZM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VTS1bPKiTZM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":549158}}

{"description":"Step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to She-Hulk: Attorney at Law!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g\n\nMarvel has been going absolutely bananas this year with their slate of Phase Four content being released on Disney+. It seems like every single week in 2022 there has been a new episode of some kind of Marvle property. The latest one to hit the tiny screen is She-Hulk starring Tatiana Maslany.\n\nShe-Hulk definitely raises some questions. Like what is this show trying to be? Why is Jennifer so amazing at being a Hulk right away? Does that fourth-wall breaking stuff feel kinda weird to anyone else in the grand scheme of the MCU? Can She-Hulk solve all problems moving forward by complaining to Marvel?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the She-Hulk: Attorney at Law! \n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nPitch Meeting Gets An Upgrade (feat.

There's a way to remove these by mixing the clay in suspension and draining that water off leaving the impurities behind. I started by digging a pit to receive the clay. Then dug clay from the creek bed and put it next to the pit in a pile. Water was mixed into the pile and it was allowed to sit for a while. The water/clay mixture was then drained off into the collection pit where it settled. This was done a number of times. After settling and the water seeping out, the pure clay was mixed with grog (crushed old pottery) and made into pots. The pots were fired and of good quality, making a ringing noise when flicked indicating no cracks or weakness. This method of purifying clay saves a lot of time and effort by removing the step of manually removing rocks from the clay body. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Why the Congressional midterm results matter so much.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nOn January 6th, 2021 (yes, during the capitol riots) the final Senate race of the 2020 election was called for a Democrat. All of a sudden Democrats had achieved something improbable: trifecta control of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. It transformed the possibilities for Biden‚Äôs first two years, giving his party the ability to legislate on their own - which they did.\n\nThe trillion-dollar stimulus, the infrastructure bill, the climate investments of the Inflation Reduction Act ‚Äî all of that was only possible because of unified Democratic control. But even under divided government, both houses of Congress will still wield an enormous amount of power over national affairs and policy. That‚Äôs why the 2022 election results aren't just a referendum on whether Democrats should keep Congress ‚Äî they'll decide who gets power, how much they'll get, and how they‚Äôll use it. And there are three ways it could all play out.\n\nOur buds at Vox.com also did this story in text form if you like reading! https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23435135/2022-midterms-congress-republican-democrat\n\nFor more reporting on the 2022 US midterm elections, read up here: https://bit.ly/3U3aGxB \n\nThere are 9 races that could decide the Senate control. Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin are some of the closest contests in the country. Keep up with us here: https://bit.ly/3WoXOnd \n\nChapters:\n475 elections 00:00\n1. What if Democrats keep both houses? 0:46\n2. What if Republicans win the House of Representatives? 1:59\n3. What if Republicans win the Senate? 4:26\nWhose vote matters? 7:01\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
