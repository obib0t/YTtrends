{"description":"In August 2023, it took about twice as long to sell an EV in the U.S. as it did the previous January. Prices of EVs are down 22% year-over-year and that's mainly driven by Tesla. About two thirds of EVs sold are Elon Musk's brand. Companies like Ford have ramped up hybrid production as demand has leveled off. While slightly more than half of consumers say EVs are the future and will eventually replace Internal Combustion Engines, less than a third of dealers say so. This all comes at a time when investments in EVs are more than ever. So what's really going on?

{"description":"Watch the official trailer for #AmericanFiction, starring Jeffrey Wright, Tracee Ellis Ross, Issa Rae, and Sterling K. Brown. From Writer/Director Cord Jefferson. Only in theaters this December.\n\n AMERICAN FICTION is Cord Jefferson's hilarious directorial debut, which confronts our culture‚Äôs obsession with reducing people to outrageous stereotypes. Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who‚Äôs fed up with the establishment profiting from ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.\n\nAbout MGM Studios: Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) is a leading entertainment company focused on the production and global distribution of film and television content across all platforms.

{"description":"Piers Morgan Uncensored is joined by MMA fighter and online influencer Dillon Danis to react to his fight with controversial social media influencer Logan Paul in which he was disqualified in the dying seconds of the fight after attempting a wrestling move on the boxer.\n\nDillon says the reason he only landed nine punches on Logan was because he kept running away. He also adds that he didn't appreciate everyone doubting him, including his friend and artist Drake, who bet on Logan Paul to knock out Dillon.\n\nDillon goes on to say if Logan Paul was a man, he would keep his side of the bargain and fight him in MMA, where Dillon believes not only could he beat Logan, but also the likes of KSI, Jake Paul and even boxers such as Floyd Mayweather. He also calls out Dana White to let him fight in the UFC and believes he would beat any UFC fighter too.\n\nSubscribe to stay up-to-date on all Uncensored content.\n\nFollow Piers Morgan Uncensored on:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PiersUncensored\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/piersmorgan...\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/piersmorganu...\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@piersmorganun...\n\nFollow Piers Morgan on:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/piersmorgan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/piersmorgan\n\nPiers Morgan Uncensored is now available on TalkTV, Fox Nation and Sky News Australia!\n\n#piersmorgan #dillondanis #loganpaul #boxing #interview #talktv","title":"Piers Morgan vs Dillon Danis On Logan Paul Fight | The Full Interview","duration":736,"channel_id":"UCatt7TBjfBkiJWx8khav_Gg","author":"Piers Morgan Uncensored","date":"20231017","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5zMQgy6FkQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/n5zMQgy6FkQ/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2478625}}
