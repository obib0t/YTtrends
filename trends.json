Furnace insulation stops heat being lost from the walls of a furnace and so increases the heat within the furnace. Dry wood ash makes an excellent insulator for heat as the fine particles separated by small air gaps don't allow heat to conduct very well. To make the furnace a double layered wall of clay was made and the space between was filled with wood ash from different fires. The clay needed to be completely dry before doing so however as it was important the the ash not get wet, which would cause it to loose its insulating properties.The furnace was tested with an iron smelt and it produced 34g of iron from 10 charges of ore. It was going quickly to start with but then I had issues with the blower towards the end of the smelt (broken housing). The furnace design is promising though as this produced the third best smelt I've done in the wild with natural tools and materials (the best were 39g and 41g over a year ago). I'll try it again later when I've replaced the broken forge blower. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #woodfurnace #furnace","title":"Primitive Technology: Wood Ash Insulated Furnace","duration":919,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230803","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTzMqWaoqYw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XTzMqWaoqYw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":944237}}

Since current is constant, it is also an indication of differences in voltage, but the script should have been a little clearer.\n\nCurrent doesn‚Äôt flow to the ground; it flows through the ground and back up. If there is electricity moving into the ground from an energized conductor, go back to the source of that conductor and see what‚Äôs happening. For the grid, it‚Äôs probably a transformer or electrical generator, in either case, a simple coil of wire.

The axle shafts were both damaged (before it was rebuilt) but they just replaced 1 axle shaft instead of both. The bearing race on the passenger side was missing as well. \n0:20 Bicycle holder on the rear was bouncing around and making the rattling noise that the customer hears. \n0:30 Tires/wheels were on a trailer. The customer drove away with the trailer.\n0:42 \"We were test driving it and I had my mechanic get out to unplug the map sensor because it was throwing a code for it and I revved it while he was unplugging it, then found this. Funniest thing I‚Äôve seen in a while\"\n0:54 The mechanic repaired the leak, redid the brake line then bled the brake system.\n1:10 Fuel tank needed to be replaced as the customer screwed multiple self-tappers into the fuel tank.\n1:20 As mentioned the customer tried to plug a USB-C cable into a regular USB port. \n1:36 The customer just recently bought this vehicle used and was not informed of the features that it had.\n1:46 The customer is going through their insurance company to get the repairs done.\n2:01 The customer towed a dump trailer that was too big/heavy for the truck they have. A 3/4 ton or 1 ton would have been better for the job. They are trying to get insurance to cover the damage.\n2:13 International with a Cummins Engine. The technician isn't quite sure what the driver put in the diesel exhaust tank to make it look like cheese. He thinks maybe they put diesel in the tank by accident or hydraulic fluid.\n2:22 \"Customer had \"engine work\" done at another local shop. Driving it home the car apparently filled with smoke and then quit running. She had a new battery installed and warranted it 3 times. It came to our shop and you couldn't even jump it. The battery-positive cable to the starter was shorted to the ground. Found there were only 3 of the 4 bolts holding the AC compressor in. Removed the compressor and found the reason why- the 4th bolt hole was blocked by the B+ cable sandwiched between the compressor and its bracket.\"\n2:39 2022 Dodge Ram 1500. The technician wasn't informed who/what shop apparently did this. So they think it might have been the customer.\nThe rear differential pinion melted since there was no gear oil in the differential.\n2:54 \"Plugged in the tester, but couldn't find anything valid.\nI suggested it was an electronic failure of a French car (I'm used to, that French cars could behave a little bit strange issues, sometimes). So I disconnected the battery, but the alarm was still going. Then I found the Alarm-clock. Me and my customer laughed.\"\n3:09 In the last photo you can see that the customer's \"friend\" installed the head gasket incorrectly as the part that says FRONT is supposed to be at the front of the engine.\n3:24 \"1974 Corvette 454, tko 500 5 speed Granatelli cutouts.\"\n3:35 Outro.

{"description":"Welcome to the Porsche 911 S/T. Designed by Porsche as a present to itself on the 60th anniversary of the 911 (there‚Äôs 1,963 planned in honour of the birth year), the S/T revives a grand old name from 1969 when a 911 S was sprinkled with a touch of motorsport fairy dust to become the S/T - a fearsome competition car that did without the aid of big wings and hefty aero. A kind of beautiful Frankenstein‚Äôs monster, the S/T was a competition car, but not prolific. \n\nThe modern S/T follows the same path, though with much more modern vim. Mounted in the back is the naturally-aspirated, 521bhp 4-litre boxer from the GT3 RS coupled to that short-ratio manual (with shorter cogs than a GT3). There are no big wings bar a short Gurney flap on the electric rear spoiler, which itself doesn‚Äôt raise quite as high as other 911s. The rear-wheel steer system is ditched to save weight and complexity, and the bonnet, front wings, ‚Äòcage, rear anti-roll bars and shear panel underneath are all carbon fibre. The wheels are centre-lock and magnesium, the glass thinned to shave precious pounds. Even the battery has been on a diet, and now consists of a lightweight race-style lithium-ion unit. Cobble all this together with the slim carbon bucket seats along with weight savings from the powertrain and clutch, and the S/T becomes the lightest production 911. With a kerbweight of 1,380kg, it‚Äôs 40kg lighter than a manual GT3 Touring. \n\nThere are plenty more facts and figures, and who better to show Top Gear magazine‚Äôs Tom Ford around the new Super 911 than the man behind it and the boss of Porsche's GT division, Andreas Preuninger.\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Intro\n01:04 The Porsche 911 ST design\n02:45 Interior\n04:58 The heritage design package\n05:58 Chatting with Andreas Preuninger\n08:23 How to make the Porsche 911 ST\n11:15 Will it still win our hearts?\n14:23 Conclusion\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks¬†\nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

{"description":"Undefeated three-division champion Terence ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Crawford emphatically stamped his place in the history books with a ninth-round TKO over the previously unbeaten Errol ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù Spence Jr. to become the first undisputed welterweight champion of the four-belt era in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions.\n \n‚ÄúIt means everything because of who I took the belts from,‚Äù said Crawford. ‚ÄúThey talked bad about me. They said I wasn‚Äôt good enough and I couldn‚Äôt beat these welterweights. I just kept my head to the sky and kept praying to God that I would get the opportunity to show the world how great Terence Crawford is. Tonight, I believe I showed how great I am.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúHe was just better tonight,‚Äù said Spence. ‚ÄúHe was using the jab. My timing was a little bit off. He was just the better man tonight.‚Äù\n \nIn addition to adding the WBC, WBA and IBF titles to his WBO belt, Crawford became the first male fighter to become an undisputed champion in two weight classes, having previously won all four belts at 140-pounds. In a fight where Spence had already been down three times, Crawford‚Äôs ninth round onslaught of hooks forced referee Harvey Dock to wave off the action 2:32 in the frame.\n \nAfter years of build-up, Spence came out aggressively in the opening round, jabbing and attacking Crawford‚Äôs body. Crawford, who is known for fighting from both the southpaw and orthodox stances, fought primarily as a southpaw and scored his first knockdown in round two with a powerful right cross that caught Spence off balance and sent him down for the first time in his career.\n \n‚ÄúWe practice that,‚Äù said Crawford. ‚ÄúNormally in camp we do a flick and jab. But we knew that wasn‚Äôt going to work with Errol Spence because he‚Äôs durable, he‚Äôs strong. So we had to practice a strong firm jab. The jab hit him and stopped him in his tracks.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúHe was just throwing the hard jab,‚Äù said Spence. ‚ÄúHe was timing with his jab. His timing was just on point. I wasn‚Äôt surprised by his speed or his accuracy. It was everything I thought.‚Äù\n \nSpence came out in round three determined to turn the tide after the knockdown, throwing big shots, including a left hook that landed cleanly early. However, Crawford was able to withstand the attack and showed his precision by landing a clean counter right that again staggered Spence.\n \n‚ÄúErrol Spence is a tremendous talent and he‚Äôs got a great jab,‚Äù said Crawford. ‚ÄúWe were worried about the jab coming in because that‚Äôs how he sets up all of his shots.  Our main focus was the jab. You take away his best attribute. The rest is history.‚Äù\n \nIn round seven, Crawford dropped Spence twice, once with a clean right uppercut early on and again late in the round with a right hook. Crawford led 79-70 on all three cards at the time of the stoppage and dominated the CompuBox stats with an 185 to 96 advantage in punches landed and an astounding 50% connect rate.\n \nPost-fight, Crawford showed his respect for Spence stepping up to the plate and making the super fight happen and spoke to the historic nature of the matchup, while Spence expressed his interest in a rematch later this year.\n \n‚ÄúWe gotta do it again,‚Äù said Spence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a lot better. It‚Äôll be a lot closer. It‚Äôll probably be in December and the end of the year. I say we gotta do it again.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúLike I said before, I only dreamed of being a world champion,‚Äù said Crawford. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an overachiever. Nobody believed in me when I was coming up, but I made everybody a believer. I want to thank Spence and his team because without him none of this would have been possible.‚Äù\n\n#TerenceCrawford #ErrolSpenceJr #SpenceCrawford\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Spence vs Crawford HIGHLIGHTS: JULY 29, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":100,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20230730","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zPaYp8XN9Y","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_zPaYp8XN9Y/hqdefault.webp?v=64c5fc03","content":{"View count":4122864}}

{"description":"Fnaf Security Breach Ruins Cassies ending has taken the fnaf community by storm. In this video I do a full breakdown of Cassies timeline and the meaning behind her story within the security breach universe. I also do a breakdown of what each of the endings mean for the future of fnaf security breach and Pizza Plex's security protocol.\n\nThe FNAF Security Breach Ruin DLC is here and we played the full game live on stream! The New DLC is packed with Secret Endings and of course we get to see the animatronics at their scariest form as we play as Cassie trying to save Gregory from the new Mimic character. We also found two of the secret Ruin DLC endings which were amazing. Overall, Steel Wool did a fantastic job of making Security Breach feel like a whole new game. The original pizza plex is a lot darker now and brings a new horror element to it. Not to mention the way they made Roxanne Wolf, Chica, Glamrock Bonnie, and Glamrock Freddy. This Ruin DLC will go down as one of the best FNAF games of all time!\n\nEditor -  @justblur3774 \n\n#fnaf #fnafruin #fnafsecuritybreach #fnafruindlc","title":"What Actually Happened to Cassie in FNAF Ruin? - Story and Endings Explained","duration":694,"channel_id":"UCUf474R0U82zkRk1R5sJtSQ","author":"Rexter","date":"20230731","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RRbfpQFBc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W3RRbfpQFBc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":672710}}
