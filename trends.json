{"description":"The Miami Heat managed to hold off the Boston Celtics from making a 3-0 comeback, securing their second trip to the NBA Finals in five years, their first appearance since the 2020 NBA Bubble Finals.\n\nThe Miami Heat have executed despite not having a star-studded roster outside of Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. Head Coach Erik Spoelstra is making a convincing case to be the best coach in the entire league, putting players like Caleb Martin and Gabe Vincent into positions where they can succeed. The Caleb Martin game 7 performance was what ultimately helped elevate them to the win. Erik Spoelstra managed to navigate the Gabe Vincent injury masterfully.\n\nThe success of guys like Caleb Martin highlights the importance of maximizing undrafted talent and knowing how to use guys in ways that maximizes their strengths. The Miami Heat do this arguably better than any other team in the NBA. It's what made Heat vs Celtics such a contentious matchup, and why the Celtics had such a hard time handling it.\n\nEven guys like Haywood Highsmith getting significant run, defending premiere players like Jayson Tatum, is a testament to how the Miami Heat keep a big toolbox of players for any given scenario. Even when Jimmy Butler was struggling, they had guys who could step up. Jayson Tatum's injury was certainly something that might've helped, but the Boston Celtics just didn't step up. This win officially made them the first 8th seed in NBA history to make the NBA Finals in a non-lockout season.\n\n‚û• ùôéùô™ùôóùô®ùôòùôßùôûùôóùôö: https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexHoops?sub_confirmation=1\n‚û• ùôèùô¨ùôûùô©ùô©ùôöùôß: https://twitter.com/AlexHoops_\n‚û• ùòΩùôöùôòùô§ùô¢ùôö ùôñ ùôãùôñùô©ùôßùô§ùô£: https://patreon.com/AlexHoops\n\n‚û• ùôñùôóùô§ùô™ùô© ùô¢ùôö\nProviding NBA analysis by making film digestible and using analytics thoughtfully to contextualize on-court production.

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to the final installment of our Nordic/Scandinavian trip - the Glass Igloos in Finland! So far on our trip, we have taken a communal hot bath at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland, nearly cryogenically frozen ourselves at the ICEHOTEL in Sweden, and now we're on to Arctic Finland to stay in a glass igloo under the northern lights!\n\nFor years, I've been seeing the glass igloos in Finland on my instagram, tiktok - **and YouTube shorts** feeds - and I've always wanted to try them out. I've never seen the northern lights before, and I've also never stayed in a human-sized terrarium before, but I've always been intrigued by those see-through bubble tents - so we decided to go and try one out and see if we freeze our butts off!

{"description":"You‚Äôll be amazed at what you can do with GrammarlyGO. Sign up at https://grammarly.com/heatcheck05 and get 20% off Grammarly Premium.\n\nDo you remember this shot?\nWell the Celtics did the same thing but with the stakes being much higher.\nBoston comes back from 0-3 and secures a game 7 in the most insane way possible. And the final 2 minutes deserve a breakdown.\nDown by 7 at the end, Miami is fighting desperately here. But it was almost game over as Horford has the ball but gets it poked. And follow Jimmy here as he‚Äôs going to slip this screen for Robinson causing a split second hesitation by Smart enough for him to have enough space to fire away this shot and bring it within 4.\nButler was just 3 for 19 up to this point, but when it matters the most he delivers.\n4 point game and Miami defends in a zone here. The Celtics find Horford in the middle and the great cut by Tatum to get the ball, but even better read by Bam to help on the drive, a great contest and the Heat have a real chance here with a 1:40 left. In transition you know who has the ball at the end of the game. And with Adebayo screening for Duncan, Horford has to be there with him so Jimmy sees that the paint is open so he barrels inside and gets 2 free throws, now this is where the real madness begins.\nButler hits the first to make it a 3 point game but misses the second however watch Martin as he‚Äôs going to reposition while the ball is sitting on the rim and actually ends up with the rebound.\nHe finds none other than the best shooter on the floor all alone for this shot and misses it. He was on fire the entire game. How did he miss this look? Had all the time in the world right here. The drama continues.\nTatum wants the ball here and he‚Äôs going to set a screen to get a switch. Butler defends for the drive but Robinson fights over the screen and stays with White. You see that Tatum is open right here and the pass goes to him, Bam tries to contest but this is an open look. And at the same time watch Brown here who‚Äôs got an uncontested rebound. And on the miss he gets the ball and misses it but gets the foul call. \nJaylen makes the first but misses the second allowing a transition opportunity for Miami. And again watch how dangerous Robinson is as he‚Äôs going to set a ghost screen fooling Smart and clearing the way for Jimmy to attack right at the basket and not only that but get a bucket and the foul. Unbelievable. It‚Äôs only a 1 point game with 50 seconds to go. And things are about to escalate here.\nThe Heat staying in the zone and Tatum has the ball again, blows past Butler but Vincent follows that and steps in right here completely disrupting the drive and it‚Äôs a loose ball but JT recovers goes up for the shot but gets it blocked by Adebayo.\nA real flashback from that iconic block from the bubble. But let‚Äôs get back to the present day as that defensive stop opens up another transition opportunity and you see that the Celtics are scrambling with 2 guys pointing towards Robinson but nobody near him. \nHe has another wide open look for the lead and misses again. Absolutely unreal. This would have given Miami a 2 point advantage in the closing seconds. Now they had to foul but got a bit lucky because Smart misses 1 free throw. And in a do or die situation Spoelstra asks Jimmy if he wants to go without a timeout and he confirms. A gutsy decision by a great coach.\nBack to the video for the crucial possession. You know who‚Äôs gonna take the last shot. And Tatum is on him. Bam goes to screen and is able to force a switch putting a slower Horford in front. But with 5 seconds remaining Jimmy is almost at the logo. Duncan clears the side and Butler goes to the corner for a desperation shot and gets fouled! He gets fouled and on the review we see that his feet are behind the line so it‚Äôs 3 shots for the win.\nHe‚Äôs an 80% shooter from the line this postseason and with the NBA finals on the line, calmly knocks all three shots one by one.\nWhich brings us to the ultimate chaos at the end. You see that Struss is guarding White on the inbounds but he‚Äôs faced the other way and traps Tatum here as Miami didn‚Äôt want him to take the shot. So the pass goes to Smart and as the shot goes up, White has the presence of mind to go inside for the rebound and Struss is trying to recover back to him but he‚Äôs trailing.\nSo on the miss Derrick puts it back in but the buzzer sounds at the same time, so everyone is confused. Complete madness and disbelief in the arena as the refs are checking this frame by frame and we see that White was able to get it off with 1 tenth of a second remaining to force a game 7 and save his team from the brink of elimination in the craziest way possible.\nThis instantly reminded me of the legendary Ray Allen shot that completely demoralized San Antonio in game 6 who were just moments from winning the championship. And we‚Äôve heard the stories of how that postgame dinner looked like a funeral for the Spurs.\nWell this was the same thing in my opinion.","title":"THIS Will HAUNT Miami...The Mistake That Cost Them The Finals","duration":517,"channel_id":"UCmwxBk7Af9OnnloGZzp6JnQ","author":"Heat Check","date":"20230528","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmzsKp-iCcc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JmzsKp-iCcc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":288149}}

{"description":"Today‚Äôs In a Nutshell will be on Roblox King Legacy, a Roblox RPG game based on the anime One Piece. The game is very similar to Blox Fruits and is the second most popular One Piece game on Roblox. So what that means is yeah... most of this video is going to be a shetpost. \n\nKing Legacy is a generic Roblox roleplaying game (RPG) where players complete quests, level up and get more powerful gears. Currently, there is the First and Second Sea. NPCs in the Second Sea are stronger, and the player needs to be at least level 2250 to enter. The levelling is almost the same as Blox Fruits, where each island has a few NPC giving out quests, and completing them will level you up. The current max level is 4000, so you can go from noob to pro in a day or two if you are dedicated. Using codes will help you level faster. \n\nThere are 3 types of attacks for combat: fruit, melee and sword. Each type of attack has different abilities, and their damage depends on your stats. \n\nFruits are obtained by scavenging, rolling from gacha or buying from the black market. Fruits spawn every 1 or 2 hours and you can roll for them 5 times every 6 hours. The black market restocks every hour but fruits there are randomized. There is no definite tier list of which fruit is the best. The best fruit depends on your combo and how it synergizes with other abilities. Certain fruits are good for grinding, while others are good for PvP. The good fruits are Dragon, Dough, Light, Magma, Gravity, Dark and Venom. \n\nFor melee, there are currently 5 fighting styles: Black Leg, Cyborg, Real Water Style (Fishman Karate), Dragon Claw and Electro. All except Fishman Karate can be upgraded to V2 for more damage and cooler effects. \n\nSwords have 2 abilities, and they are obtained by killing bosses or by purchasing. Sword can be upgraded at the blacksmith. The normal upgrade gives more damage, and the enchantment gives special effects. \n\nLike Blox Fruits, there are special abilities like Busoshoku Haki, Kenbunshoku Haki, Soru,  Geppo and Haoshoku Haki (Conqueror's haki). Buso Haki makes you black and deals more damage on non-fruit attacks. Ken Haki gives ESP and auto-dodge. Soru lets you teleport a short distance, Geppo lets you jump in the air, and Conqueror‚Äôs Haki stuns lower-level people around you.\n\nSo yeah, just like all the other Roblox In A Nutshell videos, I will attempt to show everything Roblox King Legacy has to offer: abilities, fruits, fighting styles, swords, guns, races, accessories, stats, combat, and grinding. Some people speculate that guns will be added in the next update and that would be hilarious cuz it would just be like Blox Fruits.  And like always, this Roblox video is filled with a crapload of dumb jokes and dead memes and takes the form of a funny moments/funny montage/edit. Hit the like and the subscribe button if you enjoyed this video, click the bell icon and don't forget to comment in the comment section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis video contains a crap load of dead memes and bad jokes.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet¬≠to¬≠be¬≠dreamed-up creation.

{"description":"As was reported might be the case, it turns out that the first day after chemo is pretty OK, but then it gets progressively worse until day 5 or 6. I'm now on day 7 and feeling OK. I've had many (but not all!) of the expected side effects, but my appetite has been good, which is very good for the quality of life! Glad to be through the worst of the first treatment, but obviously I've still got a long way to go. I wouldn't want everyone to think that Day 7 is indicative of how you feel while you're doing chemo...if you had seen me on Day 3 I would have been 100% horizontal. \n\nI hear it tends to get a little worse every time (though I've got some tips for how to maybe make a few things hit a little less hard!) Really glad I was feeling good enough to make this video! It was nice to do something normal.\n\nThanks y'all.\n\nHank\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com","title":"My Cancer Press Tier List","duration":326,"channel_id":"UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA","author":"vlogbrothers","date":"20230526","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO80u6G_zQM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UO80u6G_zQM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1519761}}

Hollywood paints it as a time of gunslingers, adventure, and cowboy heroes, but as often is the case, the reality is a bit more lackluster. While it was a rather violent place with high murder rates, this can be misleading as even one murder in a small population size can produce seemingly astronomical murder rates, essentially enhancing outliers in data. The truth is, the \"Wild West\" was a rather calm and boring time where people were much more focused on getting to the next day than robbing trains or saving damsels in distress. But while the dangers painted by Hollywood and dime novels are often over exaggerated and glamorized, that doesn't mean the region and time period was void of danger! So join me back in time to learn about the real history and dangers of the American Wild West!\n\nTitle: Brett Van Donsel ‚Äì Rattlesnake Railroad\nArtist: Brett Van Donsel\nSource: http://soundcloud.com/brett-van-donse...\nLicense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWild West by ZitronSound http://bit.ly/2nXGy9W\nCreative Commons ‚Äî CC BY-ND 3.0 https://goo.gl/QHshNa","title":"How to Survive the Wild West","duration":1410,"channel_id":"UCvQ4C0f9_OWRf1uyobwqOwA","author":"BlueJay","date":"20230526","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLWZBXBOBs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxLWZBXBOBs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":572686}}
