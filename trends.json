{"description":"QUEEN rediscovered track featuring Freddie Mercury ‚ÄòFACE IT ALONE‚Äô arrives as digital single release Thursday October 13\nPrecedes arrival of Queen ‚ÄòThe Miracle Collector‚Äôs Edition‚Äô coming November 18 \n\nPre-order The Miracle-Collector's Edition: https://Queen.lnk.to/TheMiracle\nDownload/Stream Face It Alone: https://Queen.lnk.to/FaceItAlone\n\nHaving generated a media firestorm back in the summer when band members Brian May and Roger Taylor first leaked news of a rediscovered Queen song featuring Freddie Mercury being considered for possible release, the highly anticipated ‚Äòlost‚Äô track, ‚ÄòFace It Alone‚Äô, drops as a simultaneous worldwide single release Thursday 13 October, 11.15am BST.\n\nThe track‚Äôs existence was first revealed by May and Taylor in a BBC radio interview at their appearance at this year‚Äôs Royal Jubilee concert at which they performed the opening with their regular singer Adam Lambert, with Roger Taylor describing it as ‚Äúa little gem from Freddie that we‚Äôd kind of forgotten about‚Äù, with Brian May saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs beautiful, it‚Äôs touching.‚Äù\n\nThe track‚Äôs arrival as a single leads in a November 18 release of a new revisiting of the band‚Äôs 13th album, The Miracle, the band‚Äôs penultimate to be released in Freddie Mercury‚Äôs lifetime, which now becomes available in a lavish 8-disc Queen The Miracle Collector‚Äôs Edition box set format.\n\nAmong its contents, the expanded set includes The Miracle Sessions: an hour-plus disc of further previously unreleased recordings, including six unpublished songs. Just as tantalising for fans, the audio includes the band‚Äôs candid spoken exchanges on the studio floor in London and Montreux, giving the most revealing window yet into the four members‚Äô creative process and the joy, in-jokes and banter on their return to working together.\n\n‚ÄòFace It Alone‚Äô was originally recorded during the band‚Äôs historic 1988 sessions for that album, a prolific period which saw the band lay down around 30 tracks, many of which were never released, but remained among those that didn‚Äôt make the final album cut. It was rediscovered when the band‚Äôs production and archive team returned to those sessions to work on The Miracle box set reissue.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôd kind of forgotten about this track,‚Äù admits Roger Taylor, ‚Äúbut there it was, this little gem. It‚Äôs wonderful, a real discovery. It‚Äôs a very passionate piece‚Äù.\n\nThe single will be the first new song featuring Freddie Mercury released in over 8 years. On 2014‚Äôs Queen Forever album the band included three previously unheard tracks with Mercury, including ‚ÄòLet Me in Your Heart Again,‚Äô ‚ÄòLove Kills‚Äô and ‚ÄòThere Must Be More to Life Than This.‚Äô\n\nSpeaking of the rediscovered track, Brian May says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy that our team were able to find this track.  After all these years, it‚Äôs great to hear all four of us ‚Ä¶ yes, Deacy is there too ‚Ä¶ working in the studio on a great song idea which never quite got completed ‚Ä¶ until now!‚Äù\n\nSubscribe to the official Queen channel Here https://Queen.lnk.to/Subscribe\nWatch more: https://Queen.lnk.to/OfficialMusicVideos\n\nAbout Queen:\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.

{"description":"The video you have all been waiting for is here! Our wedding vlog! We had so many people who filmed and helped make this video happen. Dakota and I were so excited to spend the weekend in California, and to be able to see all of our family and friends! We flew out on Wednesday, and spent the day prepping and hanging out before the chaos of everything. On Thursday it was time for our rehearsal and rehearsal dinner! We wanted to have things a little more casual than normal so we did a small get together with family and friends roasting s'mores and eating snacks! Then of course Friday came along (wedding day) and we spent the day getting ready and then getting MARRIED! \n\nWe have so much footage so we are making a WHOLE OTHER VIDEO for the ceremony AND the rehearsal speeches, but everything else we vlogged is in this video!

Radioactive chemistry was one of my favorite topics back in university, so I hope to spread the love of science, physics, and chemistry with this video! \n\nThe word \"radiation\" often will often cause hair to stand on end ever since the end of the Cold War, however without it, life as we know it could not exist! While often associated with nuclear weapons and fallout, radiation is much more than the scary disasters we read about in the news. Simply put, radiation is just the transmission of energy through particles or waves through space or material mediums, meaning all the warmth, light, and colors you experience in this beautiful world are a direct result of radiation!\n\nI hope you enjoy this surface level dive into the topic of radiation, but please, if this topic interests you feel free to peruse a handful of the sources I used below: \n\nhttps://www.aocopm.org/assets/documents/10-31-11_Basic_Course_III_Orlando/ionizing%20an%20non.pdf\n\nhttps://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/UVB\n\nhttps://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/science-101/what-is-a-geiger-counter.html\n\nhttp://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/17793/1/DP70461.pdf\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\n\nhttps://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-electromagnetic-radiation-and-vs-nuclear-radiation/\n\nhttps://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/intro_9_5.html\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/training/products/RN/page4976.html\n\nhttps://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l3_p4.html\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome\n\nhttps://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html\n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-basics\n\nhttps://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Furman_University/CHM101%3A_Chemistry_and_Global_Awareness_(Gordon)/05%3A_Basics_of_Nuclear_Science/5.04%3A_Ionizing_Radiation_and_Non-ionizing_Radiation\n\nhttps://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Sacramento_City_College/SCC%3A_CHEM_330_-_Adventures_in_Chemistry_(Alviar-Agnew)/11%3A_Nuclear_Chemistry/11.06%3A_Penetrating_Power_of_Radiation\n\nhttps://www.mirion.com/learning-center/radiation-safety-basics/types-of-ionizing-radiation","title":"Radiation in a Nutshell","duration":882,"channel_id":"UCvQ4C0f9_OWRf1uyobwqOwA","author":"BlueJay","date":"20221011","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMuYohlRlfY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zMuYohlRlfY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":308346}}

{"description":"So recently I got hurt in my last 3v3 basketball game and got another concussion. Due to my history of concussions and the symptoms I have currently, I've decided to withdraw myself from the 3v3 league and to officially quit playing basketball competitively anywhere for GOOD. This decision wasn't easy to accept but after talking with doctors, my family and friends this is the best choice for me and my mental health.  I lost my collegiate scholarship for this same injury so I've been through this kind of heartbreak before. Although this is the end for me playing basketball, I still plan to utilize my talents and expertise with basketball in my future content. I'm a firm believer in if one thing you do fails, you will soon have an opportunity to try to succeed at something else. Thank you for all the love and support.

{"description":"Alex Iwobi gave Everton a dream start but the Blues‚Äô unbeaten run came to an end after a narrow 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Goodison Park.\n\nBuoyed by two straight Premier League victories and without tasting defeat in seven matches in all competitions, Frank Lampard‚Äôs men looked to be on their way to more success when Iwobi stroked home a sweet 25-yard finish past David de Gea with just five minutes on the clock.\n\nThat proved to be the peak moment, however, with Everton the makers of their own downfall as mistakes in possession enabled Anthony to level on 14 minutes before substitute Cristiano Ronaldo netted his 700th club goal just before the break.\n\nThe Toffees were much improved in the second half ‚Äì with the welcome return of Dominic Calvert-Lewin off the bench ‚Äì but they could not find a leveller despite a spirited response.\n\nSubscribe to Everton Football Club's official YouTube Channel: http://bit.ly/2wtCEbB\n\nFollow us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/everton\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/everton\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/everton\n\nWelcome to the Official Everton Football Club YouTube channel.

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n#backpacking #travel #travelvlog #camping \n\n00:00 why we‚Äôre going to the woods\n00:30 this is not what you think it is\n02:53 how heavy our backpacks are\n04:05 first campsite\n05:40 we slept with MICE AND SPIDERS\n08:16 didn‚Äôt have to dig a hole to poop!\n09:52 why we love AG1\n11:07 what we‚Äôre eating for lunch everyday\n13:45 Nate‚Äôs life-altering decision :)\n14:58 extremely scary‚Ä¶\n16:35 setting up our tent for the first time!\n19:22 how we purify water\n20:20 climbing a sketchy tower for sunset\n22:27 day 3: early wake up call\n25:09 Nate did not drag me here\n29:37 PART 2 IS GOING TO BE WEIRD","title":"We Need a Break (going off the grid)","duration":1862,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20221008","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcAeXMhMW08","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/wcAeXMhMW08/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":874210}}
