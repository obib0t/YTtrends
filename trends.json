{"description":"NBC News has learned new details about the moment San Francisco police officers arrived at the home of Paul Pelosi during an alleged assault.\r\n\r\nA top ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding fresh answers from the U.S. Capitol Police about security failures that led to a brutal attack on Pelosi‚Äôs husband last week, questioning the embattled agency about whether it can keep lawmakers and their families safe.\r\n\r\nHouse Administration Committee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., sent a four-page letter to Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger on Wednesday, saying the attack on Paul Pelosi raises ‚Äúsignificant questions about security protections for Members of Congress.‚Äù The man who beat Paul Pelosi with a hammer was looking for Nancy Pelosi and later told police that he wanted to hold her hostage and break her kneecaps to make a political point, authorities said.\r\n\r\nThe searing letter lays out a series of questions for Manger and orders the agency to lay out its plans for protecting lawmakers and their families, including how they are interacting with other law enforcement agencies, how officers are trained for such situations and whether there are special plans in place to protect lawmakers in the presidential line of succession, as Pelosi is.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Lofgren, whose panel oversees the Capitol Police, comes as the beleaguered agency is still trying to rebuild after the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, when hundreds of former President Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters overwhelmed officers and more than 100 were injured. Threats to lawmakers have skyrocketed in recent years ‚Äî almost 10,000 threats were investigated last year ‚Äî and the agency has struggled to protect lawmakers, their families and the Capitol campus with limited resources.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Police issued a statement Wednesday saying they will ‚Äúfast track‚Äù the work they had already been doing to protect members outside of Washington. #WakeUpCLT \r\n\r\nREAD MORE: https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/nation-world/pelosi-attack-capitol-police-safety-concerns/507-6d89c6f2-cfbc-4473-8bc7-950aa48516a9","title":"New details revealed in brutal attack on Paul Pelosi","duration":131,"channel_id":"UC-RxXi2Xws6Uk22vp-sLbGA","author":"WCNC","date":"20221104","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTS1bPKiTZM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VTS1bPKiTZM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":455824}}

It seems like every single week in 2022 there has been a new episode of some kind of Marvle property. The latest one to hit the tiny screen is She-Hulk starring Tatiana Maslany.\n\nShe-Hulk definitely raises some questions. Like what is this show trying to be? Why is Jennifer so amazing at being a Hulk right away? Does that fourth-wall breaking stuff feel kinda weird to anyone else in the grand scheme of the MCU? Can She-Hulk solve all problems moving forward by complaining to Marvel?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the She-Hulk: Attorney at Law! \n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nPitch Meeting Gets An Upgrade (feat.

There's a way to remove these by mixing the clay in suspension and draining that water off leaving the impurities behind. I started by digging a pit to receive the clay. Then dug clay from the creek bed and put it next to the pit in a pile. Water was mixed into the pile and it was allowed to sit for a while. The water/clay mixture was then drained off into the collection pit where it settled. This was done a number of times. After settling and the water seeping out, the pure clay was mixed with grog (crushed old pottery) and made into pots. The pots were fired and of good quality, making a ringing noise when flicked indicating no cracks or weakness. This method of purifying clay saves a lot of time and effort by removing the step of manually removing rocks from the clay body. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Why the Congressional midterms matter so much.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nOn January 6th, 2021 (yes, during the capitol riots) the final Senate race of the 2020 election was called for a Democrat. All of a sudden Democrats had achieved something improbable: trifecta control of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. It transformed the possibilities for Biden‚Äôs first two years, giving his party the ability to legislate on their own - which they did.\n\nThe trillion-dollar stimulus, the infrastructure bill, the climate investments of the Inflation Reduction Act ‚Äî all of that was only possible because of unified Democratic control. But even under divided government, both houses of Congress will still wield an enormous amount of power over national affairs and policy. That‚Äôs why the 2022 election isn‚Äôt just a referendum on whether Democrats should keep Congress ‚Äî it‚Äôs a question of who gets that power, and how they‚Äôll use it. And there are three ways it could all play out.\n\nOur buds at Vox.com also did this story in text form if you like reading! https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23435135/2022-midterms-congress-republican-democrat\n\nFor more reporting on the 2022 US midterm elections, read up here: https://bit.ly/3U3aGxB \n\nThere are 9 races that could decide the Senate control.

Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn‚Äôt been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family‚Äôs future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.\n \n‚ÄúDisenchanted‚Äù stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Gabriella Baldacchino, with Idina Menzel and James Marsden.

{"description":"At least 17 missiles were fired by North Korea, according to South Korea who retaliated with their own missile testing. \n\nRELATED: Sirens sound alarm after North Korea fires missile over Japan\nhttps://bit.ly/3T1a36t\n\nThe U.S. Indo Pacific Command said the launches highlighted the ‚Äúdestabilizing impact‚Äù of North Korea‚Äôs illicit nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The Japanese Defense Ministry said it also detected the launches and that the type of missiles used and their flight information were still being analyzed.\n\nSouth Korea's Foreign Ministry said its top nuclear envoy held separate phone talks with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts soon after the launches. It said the three agreed to strengthen trilateral coordination on North Korea while repeating their calls for the North to stop weapons tests and return to talks.\n\nSince late September, North Korea has launched a barrage of missiles toward the sea in what it called simulated tests of tactical nuclear weapons systems designed to attack South Korean and U.S. targets. North Korea says its testing activities were meant to issue a warning amid a series of South Korea-U.S. military drills. But some experts say Pyongyang has also used its rivals‚Äô drills as a chance to test new weapons systems, boost its nuclear capability and increase its leverage in future dealings with Washington and Seoul.\n\n¬ª Subscribe to USA TODAY: http://bit.ly/1xa3XAh\n¬ª Watch more on this and other topics from USA TODAY: https://bit.ly/3Uf6TNu\n¬ª USA TODAY delivers current local and national news, sports, entertainment,  finance, technology, and more through award-winning journalism, photos, videos and VR.\n\n#NorthKorea #SouthKorea #Missile","title":"South Korea retaliates after North Korea fires missile launches | USA TODAY","duration":71,"channel_id":"UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g","author":"USA TODAY","date":"20221102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzulTT93MVs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kzulTT93MVs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":362957}}

{"description":"Making mezcal is really hard work. Mexican producers harvest agave by hand and cook it in giant, earthen ovens. Then they crush it using a 1,000-pound, horse-drawn stone and distill it in copper pots. Despite all this effort, Mexican producers aren‚Äôt making the big bucks, even though demand for the spirit is booming.\n\nWhile Mexican regulations do require mezcal to be made in Mexico, that hasn't stopped large, international companies from scooping up mezcal supplies, repackaging, and reselling bottles for huge profits abroad. And the only organization that can stand in the way, the mezcal certifying agency COMERCAM, has faced claims of favoritism of these large companies. This has left some century-old mezcal brands frustrated and fearful that their ancestral ways of making mezcal are at risk. So, there's a growing trend of brands leaving the certified industry and choosing to call their brands \"distilled agave\" instead of mezcal.\n\nSpecial thanks to Casa Mezcal:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/casamezcal/\n\nMORE BIG BUSINESS VIDEOS: \nHow Junior's Bakes 5 Million Cheesecakes During A Cream Cheese Shortage | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/hktm2mvQKc0\nAirlines Spend Billions, So Why Are Travelers More Miserable Than Ever? | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/MhhJuDap4CU\nQuinoa Prices Crashed.
