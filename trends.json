Despite it being the dry season, it still rains unpredictably in this climate. This can undo lots of labor in dissolving bricks. I built a shelter from wood and palm thatch to house the entire brick making process from the rain. This was no easy task with primitive technology. Leveling the ground took a week with digging sticks and clay pots to move the soil down the slope to form a flat floor. Another week was spent cutting the timber with a stone axe and then lashing the frame with lawyer cane to form the 3 x 3 pyramidal hut with a total height of 3.5 m. A final week was spent cutting, splitting and thatching a total of 1850 palm fronds to cover the roof. \nI then made 50 bricks (enough for one firing) along one side of the huts floor and made a kiln from other bricks right in the center of the hut's floor under the highest point of the hut. A space for firewood was put in the corner. \nThough I didn't fire the kiln in this video due to time constraints, it should work well without burning the roof. I've previously had a kiln under cover and it worked well. This pyramidal roof design should funnel the smoke up preserving the thatch from mold and insects. The reason I went back to using thatch instead of tiles is  that I need bricks and tiles to make such a hut so this hut needs to be built before obtaining those materials.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #1 #2","title":"Primitive Technology: Undercover Brick Workshop","duration":1000,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230706","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz6aAI3shDY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xz6aAI3shDY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":948781}}

{"description":"Based on a true American Story. Killers of the Flower Moon, in theaters October.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), ‚ÄúKillers of the Flower Moon‚Äù is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, Tantoo Cardinal, Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins, and Jillian Dion, Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Scorsese, based on David Grann‚Äôs best-selling book.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, Killers of the Flower Moon was produced alongside Imperative Entertainment, Sikelia Productions and Appian Way. Producers are Scorsese, Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas and Daniel Lupi, with DiCaprio, Rick Yorn, Adam Somner, Marianne Bower, Lisa Frechette, John Atwood, Shea Kammer and Niels Juul serving as executive producers.\n\nSong: \"Stadium Pow Wow (feat.

But, those plants provide less than a percent of global water needs even though they consume a quarter of all the energy used by the water industry. The oceans are a nearly unlimited resource of water with this seemingly trivial caveat, which is that the water is just a little bit salty. It‚Äôs totally understandable to wonder why that little bit of salt is such an enormous obstacle.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-why-is-desalination-so-difficult?ref=practical-engineering\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"The 2024 Aston Martin DB12 ($281,800 in Canada, $245,000 in the US) is finally here and is what Aston calls the world‚Äôs first Super Tourer. The V12 found in the DB11 has been left behind, and in its stead is an even more powerful twin-turbo V8 that makes 671 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque.

{"description":"The EU imposed sanctions against Moscow as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But loopholes raise doubts about whether these are working.\n\nThere is evidence that dual-use items that can also be used for military purposes are reaching Russia ‚Äì from microelectronics, to replacement parts for related industries, to cars and weapons. How can this be happening in spite of sanctions? Where are the loopholes? To find out, DW reporter Miodrag Soric went to Georgia, a Western-oriented country that officially supports the imposed sanctions. Georgia is also a close neighbor of Russia, with all the economic ties and geopolitical dependencies that that implies. Allegedly, large amounts of exports continue to go to Russia via countries such as Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia. How do they get there? How can this be stopped? Miodrag Soric searches for clues.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #reporter #russia #georgia #ukraine #sanctions \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

{"description":"Check out the best shots of the day from the final round and playoff of the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic, featuring Rickie Fowler, Collin Morikawa, Adam Hadwin, and Max Homa.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PGA TOUR heads to Detroit, Michigan, this week for the fifth installment of the Rocket Mortgage Classic at Detroit Golf Club. Last year‚Äôs champion Tony Finau returns to defend his record-setting title. Finau finished with a score of 26-under-par to break the tournament scoring record by three shots, posting just one bogey on the week. He‚Äôll be accompanied by an in-form Rickie Fowler in the field. He‚Äôs finished inside the top-13 in his last four events, including a T5 finish at the U.S. Open, setting the U.S. Open single-round scoring record in round one. Justin Thomas will also be teeing it up this week in Detroit. He snapped back into form at the Travelers Championship after achieving his first top-10 since mid-March at the Valspar Championship. Only winner Keegan Bradley made more birdies at the Travelers, as he closed with a 64-62-67 in his final three rounds. Tom Kim will also like his chances this week after he finished T8 at the U.S. Open in Los Angeles. Turning 21 years old last week in Connecticut, he posted rounds of 64 and 65 to finish T38. The Korean debuted here last summer and matched the course record (63) on Sunday to finish solo seventh. Max Homa, Hideki Matsuyama, Collin Morikawa and Keegan Bradley will also be shooting for top spot in Detroit. \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Highlights | Round 4 & Playoff | Rocket Mortgage | 2023","duration":751,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20230702","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWD4Y46_89U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OWD4Y46_89U/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":668876}}

Short and medium-haul jet travel offered unparalleled speed, while the automobile promised unmatched flexibility and convenience. In France, the fastest express trains (Le Mistral) only averaged speeds of just 120km/h.\n\nAlthough French engineers had set remarkable railway speed records during the decade, including reaching 331 km/h in 1955, few considered railways to have much of a future. To compete against newer forms of transport, trains would need faster service speeds. This would require engineering new locomotives, as well as rebuilding rail lines with greater precision, gentler curves, smaller grades and in-cab signaling. The effort and resources required seemed too great to be worthwhile.\n\nOpening in 1964, the Shinkansen was the world‚Äôs first true high-speed railway.  Connecting Japan‚Äôs two largest cities (in the 1960s), Tokyo and Osaka, and travelling at speeds in excess of 120 mph (200 km/h), the new specially-designed Shinkansen trains had the highest service speeds in the world. \n\nWhile the Shinkansen was viewed with admiration around the world, French railway engineers were still world leaders in areas of acceleration, braking, and electric pickup at high speeds. In fact, many of the technologies used on the Shinkansen were pioneered by French railway engineers. \n\nInspired by the Japanese experience, the SNCF began experimental work on a high-speed rail network for France. Called the TGV ( Train √† Grande Vitesse, or \"high-speed train\" in French), they focused on a more cost-effective approach that would leverage existing infrastructure as well as newly developed technologies like gas turbine propulsion. But the road to high-speed rail in France would be fraught with skepticism, opposition and competing visions for the future of transport. \n\nReferences:\n\nJacob Meunier, On the Fast Track.
