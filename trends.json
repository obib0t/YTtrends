With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nDonut County description (from Steam):\n\nDonut County is a story-based physics puzzle game where you play as an ever-growing hole in the ground. Meet cute characters, steal their trash, and throw them in a hole.\n\nWhere Trash is Treasure\nRaccoons have taken over Donut County with remote-controlled trash-stealing holes. You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes.\n\nWhen BK falls into one of his own holes, he’s confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground… and they demand answers!\n\nThe Hole Keeps Growing\n• EXPLORE every character’s home, each with their own unique environment.\n• MOVE the hole to swallow up their stuff, growing bigger each time.\n• COMBINE objects inside for crazy effects: cook soup, breed bunnies, launch fireworks, and more.\n• CATAPULT things back out of the hole. You can use it to solve puzzles...or just destroy stuff.\n• DEVOUR everything. The hole won’t stop until the whole county is all gone.\n\n#EazySpeezy #DonutCounty #Speedrun","title":"Donut County speedruns are incredibly satisfying","duration":1779,"channel_id":"UCQSEAbOs6vsJfy7WN7iYaGQ","author":"EazySpeezy","date":"20220922","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63L0yiN3Ix0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/63L0yiN3Ix0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":314556}}

{"description":"Explore the adventures beyond our world in the NEW TRAILER for Disney's #StrangeWorld, in theaters November 23! 🦠\n\nThe feature film introduces a legendary family of explorers, the Clades, as they attempt to navigate an uncharted, treacherous land alongside a motley crew that includes a mischievous blob, a three-legged dog and a slew of ravenous creatures. “Inspired by classic adventure stories,\" said director Don Hall, “‘Strange World’ is an original animated adventure/comedy about three generations of the Clade family who overcome their differences while exploring a strange, wondrous and oftentimes hostile world.”\n \nThe voice cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal as Searcher Clade, a family man who finds himself out of his element on an unpredictable mission; Dennis Quaid as Searcher’s larger-than-life explorer father, Jaeger; Jaboukie Young-White as Searcher’s 16-year-old son, Ethan, who longs for adventure; Gabrielle Union as Meridian Clade, an accomplished pilot and Searcher’s partner in all things; and Lucy Liu as Callisto Mal, Avalonia’s fearless leader who spearheads the exploration into the strange world. “Strange World” is helmed by Don Hall (Oscar®-winning “Big Hero 6,” “Raya and the Last Dragon”) and co-director/writer Qui Nguyen (co-writer “Raya and the Last Dragon”), and produced by Roy Conli (Oscar®-winning “Big Hero 6,” “Tangled”).\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StrangeWorldMovie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/strangeworld/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/strangeworld","title":"Strange World | Official Trailer","duration":142,"channel_id":"UC_976xMxPgzIa290Hqtk-9g","author":"Walt Disney Animation Studios","date":"20220921","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKh2G73gCCs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bKh2G73gCCs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":3940976}}

{"description":"-An overview of the drama unfolding over the ship channel in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n-Preorder my new book before the holiday rush: https://practical.engineering/book\n\nErrata:\nAt 3:08, the old Harbor Bridge actually does have narrow pedestrian walkways, but they lack connectivity with pedestrian infrastructure on either side of the bridge.\nAt 3:21, a clarification: The ships can't enter the port empty (because they would have too much air draft). That means they can't be fully loaded in the inner harbor because they are already carrying some weight when they enter.\nAt 12:40, I meant to say \"20% above their capacity\"\n\nIn July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Sponsor: Fractal Pop Air RGB Case on Amazon https://geni.us/TMxbP\nNVIDIA just announced the new GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080 16GB, and RTX 4080 12GB. The new cards use the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture and are priced at $900 for the 4080 12GB, $1200 for the RTX 4080 16GB, and $1600 for the RTX 4090 24GB cards. In this video, we also talk about the specs -- like CUDA core count, RT (ray tracing) performance expectations, power utilization and consumption targets, and memory bandwidth. NVIDIA additionally announced DLSS 3, which is a major step revision over DLSS 2 and could have wider-reaching implications outside of just the GPU space (and could impact CPU bottlenecked scenarios as well). We also briefly talk about some of the architectural changes, but we’ll leave most of those until after NVIDIA’s architectural briefing with the press.\n\nGrab the BRAND NEW GN ‘Amp’ Medium Modmat on the store and support our independent reviews, testing, and journalism: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/medium-modmat-v2\n\nEVGA DROPPED NVIDIA.

{"description":"Nope, the spelling isn’t wrong, Ariel is merely using the word differently, a contraction of ‘High Performance Carbon Reduction’. So 'Hipercar'. Carbon emissions rather than carbon fibre. There’s a lot of the latter about, although underneath the chassis is aluminium and most of the body sections are weighty 3D-printed test panels. It’s 1,759kg as it sits here, but Ariel is confident of dropping that below 1,500kg with full carbon panels and carbon wheels. The jet turbine is a range extender – it exists to charge the 56kWh battery, not drive the wheels. Available as either 2WD or 4WD, with or without the jet turbine, full house versions are likely to be knocking on the door of seven figures. That’s a complete sea change for Ariel, for a car without classic hypercar elegance. But this is new tech, new age, new customer base. It’s something totally different, something wild and outrageous, the essence of Ariel in electric form.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n0:35 Ariel HQ\n1:04 The Hipercar\n2:15 Q+A with Simon Saunders\n12:39 Drive\n14:20 Launch\n15:11 Outro\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nMORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:\nWant to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?
