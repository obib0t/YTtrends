Movie, a new, big-screen adventure starring one of pop culture‚Äôs most prominent plumbers of the past four decades.\n\nBased on the world of Nintendo‚Äôs Mario games, the film invites audiences into a vibrant, thrilling new universe unlike any created before in an action-packed, exuberant cinematic comedy event. \n\nWhile working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt; Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi. \n\nWith the assistance of a Mushroom Kingdom resident Toad (Keegan-Michael Key; The Lion King) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy;The Queen‚Äôs Gambit), Mario taps into his own power. \n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an extraordinary comedic cast, including Jack Black (Jumanji films) as Bowser, Seth Rogen (Neighbors franchise) as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen (Portlandia, Saturday Night Live) as Cranky Kong, Kevin Michael Richardson (American Dad!, Family Guy) as Kamek and Sebastian Maniscalco (Green Book) as Spike, plus a special voice appearance by Charles Martinet, who has voiced the characters of Mario and Luigi in the Super Mario games for more than 30 years.\n\nThe film is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (collaborators on Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part). \n\nFrom Nintendo and Illumination‚Äîcreator of the global blockbuster Despicable Me, Minions, Sing and The Secret Life of Pets franchises‚ÄîThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is produced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri p.g.a. and by Nintendo‚Äôs Representative Director and Fellow Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario, after more than six years of close bond and discussions between the two. The film is co-financed by Universal Pictures and Nintendo and will be released worldwide by Universal Pictures.","title":"The Super Mario Bros.

Download the free Ground News app at https://ground.news/miniminuteman\n\nVIDEO INFO\nHowdy friends! In this video, we continue our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support this potentially history-altering theory.\n\nMY SOCIALS:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/miniminuteman/\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@miniminuteman\nE-Mail (Business inquiries only.

{"description":"As they walk through the mines, Mando picks up a dusty Mandalorian helmet, when he‚Äôs captured by a large cyborg with a general grievous looking organic eye. Super cool concept whoever came up with this and then got it approved did a great job. I loved this, had some old revenge of the sith concept art vibes. He moves like Grievous, and is literally just a brain with one eye, the rest is mecahnical. Whatever this creature is, he has some very high end cybernetics, akin to Grievous‚Äôs.\n\nGrogu tries to free mando with the force but fails and so Din tells Baby Yoda to go get Bo Katan. Now some people in the live stream chat were wondering why he didn‚Äôt say go get Boba Fett, but I would say because there‚Äôs less explanation needed with Bo Katan and the fact that Bo knows Mandalore well. \nAs Baby Yoda grabs her attention by landing, they head in her ship, the Gauntlet Starfighter.\nLanding back on Mandalore, she tells Grogu it didn‚Äôt always look like this you know, as they land down and go find Mando, heading deep into the mines. Taking her helmet off as she stares at what has become of Mandalore. She says this once was a beautiful city, and that her family laid claim to it all‚Ä¶now it‚Äôs just a tomb. She‚Äôs quite aware of her surroundings as she pushes Grogu aside and blasts down some Allamites. We see how proficient she is as a fighter and mandalorian as she makes quick work of them without the dark saber at her side.\n\n\nHeading into the general grievous 2.0‚Äôs lair where mando is being held, she fights him and then summons the dark saber as she ignites it and moves so smooth and swiftly around unlike Din Djarin who wields it like it‚Äôs Thor‚Äôs heavy hammer and he‚Äôs unworthy as heck.\nBo beats the creature twice, once in his grievous form, and then again in his mecha warrior suit. The Dark saber is rumored to be more powerful than a lightsaber blade, but who knows for sure in canon.\n\n She seems inspired or perhaps has a nefarious plan behind this but tells Din she‚Äôll take him to the springs he seeks for atonement. Grogu pfffts which tells me he doesn‚Äôt trust Bo, he can probably feel her nefarious feelings perhaps.\n\nShe says the empire set out to punish them to wipe away their memory of their glorious planet. Bo says what‚Äôs painful is not that the empire destroyed them, but rather the civil wars they endured for centuries, leading to the weakness for the Empire to break them.\nBo admits as a child she went to the springs to play but as her royal family would have her do, she would publicly recite the mandalorian tenets infront of large crowds. Mandalorian people loved to see their princess do so. The Mandalorian tenets, also known as the Resol'nare, are a set of core principles that define what it means to be a Mandalorian. The six tenets include: wearing armor, speaking the language of Mandoa, defending oneself and family, raising children as Mandalorians, contributing to the clan's welfare, and answering the call to action from the Mandalore.\n\nMando tells her he wishes to have met her father, and that he died defending mandalore. Mando pauses and says this is the way. She realizes how patriotic Mando is, and she seems to like it. I think there‚Äôs a bit of a chemistry here perhaps, but a love hate relationship perhaps.\n\nThey arrive at the living waters, and it‚Äôs a dark dungy looking place now. She reads the plaque and it states that this is the place of the great mythosaur, that mandalore the great was able to tame the mythical beast. It is said that if a mandalorian rides a mythosaur, they control all mandalore and mandalorians. I think it even goes beyond the authority of the dark saber. Personally, I think Mandalore the great is just the new canon version of mandalore the ultimate. Mandalore the Great was an ancient Mandalorian ruler who led the Mandalorians in a series of conflicts against the Jedi Order.\nAs Din walks into the water and recites his vow as a mandalorian and the creed, Bo looks on in admiration of his loyalty and passion for Mandalorians. She seems like she really respects it, as he recites and walks further, he drops like a sack of bricks in the water all the way to the bottom surface where Bo grabs him and as she blasts back up to the surface with Mando, she passes a GIANT creature, a mythosaur thought to be extinct!\n\nSo the Mythosaur still exists. This means rule over Mandalore is still possible if one is to tame the creature, which is exactly what I think Bo Katan will do. She may tame the beast, use it to defeat Din and take the dark saber for herself. \n\nA funny theory is if Grogu uses beast control to tame the beast, making him the leader of Mandalore, or perhaps Din if he tells the Mythosaur to answer to him.\n\n\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/realswtheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Episode 2 S3 BREAKDOWN - IT EXISTS!!","duration":888,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20230308","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUi5dyWfWnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cUi5dyWfWnE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":344330}}

{"description":"The 2023 Lotus Emira First Edition ($94,430 USD as spec‚Äôd, $120,688 CAD) is a brand new sports car with two engine choices. A torquey AMG 4 cylinder mated to a 6 speed auto, or a supercharged 3.5L V6 with a manual option. Both options come with strong horsepower numbers at 359 hp and 400 hp respectively, but the smaller 4 cylinder actually has a bit more torque. James has secretly used the company credit card to put a deposit down on a new Emira, and Thomas is learning that they will either have to take delivery, or forfeit their deposit altogether.

I‚Äôve been interested in true crime for the longest time now, what started with me watching true crime on TV with my Nan from a young age eventually turned into studying for a degree in Law & Criminology.\n\nWhen I first watched Bailey Sarian‚Äôs series I was completely hooked, I loved how she had combined two of the things I‚Äôm most passionate about and delivered it so well. She totally inspired me to take the leap and do the same thing on my channel, so all credit for the idea goes 100% to her.\n\nI‚Äôm from the UK and will be covering cases from both the UK and internationally, let me know if there are any cases that you‚Äôd like to see from me!
