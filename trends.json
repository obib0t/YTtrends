Locked up in the depths of Thorne’s properties are Mythic items from Fortnite’s history, like The Foundation's MK-Seven Assault Rifle, Midas’ Drum Gun, Zyg and Choppy's Ray Gun, and more.\n\nCheck out new weapons that’ll help you with your break-in. Boost to a base with the “Rocket Ram,” and once inside, break out the “Infiltrator Pump Shotgun,” the “Scoped Burst SMG,” or the quick reload “Twin Mag Assault Rifle.” Want a weapon that’s a little more hands-off? Throw down a “Business Turret” that automatically fires at nearby enemies.  \n\nThis season’s Battle Pass includes all new Outfits, Emotes, Pickaxes, and more to take down the villain in style.

{"description":"A new universe awaits on Netflix, starting December 22.\r\n\r\nFrom Zack Snyder, the filmmaker behind 300, Man of Steel, and Army of the Dead, comes REBEL MOON, an epic science-fantasy event decades in the making.\r\n\r\nWhen a peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a mysterious stranger living among the villagers, becomes their best hope for survival.\r\n\r\nTasked with finding trained fighters who will unite with her in making an impossible stand against the Mother World, Kora assembles a small band of warriors — outsiders, insurgents, peasants and orphans of war from different worlds who share a common need for redemption and revenge.\r\n\r\nAs the shadow of an entire Realm bears down on the unlikeliest of moons, a battle over the fate of a galaxy is waged, and in the process, a new army of heroes is formed.\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\r\n\r\nAbout Netflix:\r\nNetflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with over 238 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

I’ve covered Baseball (NCAA, LLWS, MLB), Football (NCAA, NFL), Softball (NCAA), Basketball (NBA, NCAA), Hockey (NHL), and much more!\n\nThe best part of my work as a YouTuber is being able to provide coverage of sports that may not receive as much attention as they should to the large audience I have built over the years. Many of the sports I cover aren't posted by any other YouTubers, which makes this channel that much more important.\n\nOne of my favorite accomplishments is revolutionizing the way sports channels create thumbnails. I've adopted two different styles, one with logos on the left and a game snapshot on the right, and the other with the logos in the middle and game snapshots representing both teams on either side.\n\nI have a combined 4 years of experience as a Baseball & Basketball Play by Play announcer, which is where I learned my skills for commentary/breakdowns.\n\nTwitter: @WheelsYT\nInstagram: @wheels.yt\nEmail: wheels.partnerships@gmail.com","title":"Texas vs Washington (CRAZY GAME!) | Winner To USA Championship | 2023 LLWS Highlights","duration":970,"channel_id":"UCi-INxdmFSrTrT95xU0sBpg","author":"Wheels","date":"20230823","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un1uV2vB1Oc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Un1uV2vB1Oc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":213337}}

{"description":"Patreon: https://bit.ly/SuperMegaPATREON\n\nHey Megheads. It’s been a while, huh?\nWe've missed you guys, and we know that y'all (understandably) have a lot of questions about the future of SuperMega. We wanna take a moment to give y’all an official update on the state of things.\n\nSo, first and foremost, what is the future of SuperMega? Well, to rip off the band-aid, the truth is that we do not have any definitive plans, one way or another, about the future of SuperMega. We've been asking ourselves many of the same questions that you've been asking us over the last few weeks. In our eyes, it would not be right for us to continue to put new content on the channel without genuinely reflecting on our past and contemplating what we want for the future. This could mean resuming the channel in the future, taking a lengthy hiatus, or deciding to say goodbye for good. We simply haven't had enough time to process everything and come to a decision that feels right for our fans, our loved ones, and our mental health. We know that the lack of a concrete decision will be disappointing to some, and we really do apologize for this.\n\nWithout you guys, we wouldn’t have been able to spend so many years creating and having fun. It’s been a hell of a ride up to this point, and you’ve given two dumbasses from South Carolina the ultimate gift of allowing us to share our lives, content, and friendship with you while getting to do our favorite thing in the world - create. For this, we will always be immensely grateful. Should any decisions be made moving forward, we'll make sure to share them openly. However, for now, we're signing off.\n\nThank you again to everyone who has supported us on this journey. Your uncles Matthew and Ryan will always love ya.\n\nFarewell freaks. Take it easy and don't forget to bathe.\n- Matt & Ryan (The Funny Brothers™)","title":"The Future of SuperMega","duration":101,"channel_id":"UCPPc2PdtA7gCMbjYp_i_TKA","author":"SuperMega","date":"20230823","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQRCTHtbUT8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DQRCTHtbUT8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":245661}}

Designed in 1930 by architect Arthur Kelly, Ashley's home is an Old Hollywood gem–and having had only three owners in over 90s years it's practically untouched. Inspired by her love of Europe and Nancy Meyer’s movies, Ashley enlisted interior designer Nicole Gordon, and architect John Farrace to help bring her home into the 21st century.

{"description":"Join us as we document the impacts of Tropical Storm Hilary, which brought historic flooding to Southern California in August 2023. Starting in Long Beach, we see communities band together to fill sandbags and build barricades along the coast to hold back the storm surge. But as Hilary moves inland, flash flooding hits the desert border towns and washes mud and debris onto Interstate 10 near Palm Springs.\n\nRide along as we drive through neighborhoods turned into rivers, wake up stranded drivers on the flooded interstate, and survey the damage left behind. From preparations along the coast to cars stuck in desert flood waters, this intense storm gives Southern California a taste of tropical weather rarely seen in the region.\n\nWith interviews from locals, see how SoCal responds to this record-breaking flood event. \n\nHilary was only the fourth tropical storm or hurricane on record to stay intact upon reaching California (1997 Nora, 1939 Long Beach tropical storm, and the 1858 San Diego hurricane) and the most significant in over 80 years!!!\n\nIf you enjoyed the drone video, please subscribe to @WxChasing","title":"Tropical Storm Hilary | Documenting the Deluge Soaking SoCal","duration":1138,"channel_id":"UCXoMM35ugF5iOzAEb-PmfRA","author":"Jonathan Petramala","date":"20230821","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9UjNOiECkc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_9UjNOiECkc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":433675}}

{"description":"We Tried The Minecraft COOKBOOK In Real Life... Yes, Minecraft has a cookbook, and it's crazy. From chicken jockeys to SUSPICIOUS STEW...? We tried it all and rated it on a scale of 1-10 hunger bars.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @sapnap\n➽ Twitch - @sapnap\n➽ Instagram - @sapnapinsta\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nDream: @dream \nMythical Kitchen: @mythicalkitchen \n\nI heard Minecraft made an official cookbook, and I had already tried all the Minecraft food myself, so I thought I HAD to try the OFFICIAL cookbook and see what it's like. I brought my friends GeorgeNotFound and Dream to try with me. This was our first real life Minecraft challenge as the Dream Team! The recipes were more complicated than my first time trying Minecraft food in my video \"I Ate EVERY Minecraft Food In Real Life...\", so we couldn't just use Dream's mom to cook it all. We had to hire professional chefs.\n\nI don't know any professional chefs, so I thought of reaching out to some of the best chefs on Youtube at the Mythical Kitchen! They make all the food behind the scenes for Rhett & Link at Good Mythical Morning, so I thought they would have plenty of experience making food to be judged by us. We tried food from Minecraft cake to Minecraft suspicious stew and rated them on a scale of one hunger bar to ten, based on the OFFICIAL Minecraft Cookbook recipe. Unfortunately no spider eyes or raw meat, because this is straight from Mojang, and they made sure all the recipes were safe.\n\nIf this video gets a ridiculous amount of likes (500,000 ? that seems impossible), we will try and have professional chef's recreate every Minecraft food from in game, as accurate to survival Minecraft 1.20 as possible. So basically a combination of this video, and my old video, and with George and Dream being forced to eat the nasty food with me...\n\nthank you guys for watching and hope you guys enjoy :) shoutout to team mythical and Trevor and Josh","title":"We Tried The Minecraft COOKBOOK In Real Life...","duration":1078,"channel_id":"UCqynl7rdtktKMQESdSBmE-g","author":"Sapnap","date":"20230820","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GIXtim-GKU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7GIXtim-GKU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":527708}}
