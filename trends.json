{"description":"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an \"El Tiny\" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.\n\nFi O’Reilly | September 15, 2022\nWhat a way to get our second annual El Tiny series going! Omar Apollo kicks off Latinx Heritage Month with a full-band rendition of \"En El Olvido,\" backed by Las Mariachis Lindas, as he channels a childhood spent listening to Juan Gabriel into his performance of the Mexican corrido. \n\nIn the eternal wisdom of Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre, it's not a Mexican party until someone starts crying, and Apollo embraces esta melancolía as the band slips into the easy R&B number \"Evergreen.\"  \"We're about to get more sad,\" he says to the crowd with a grin. \n\nDespite the heartbreak and unrequited love songs, there's a sense of ease in this Tiny Desk concert — an easy camaraderie among the group as the members sing through \"Evergreen\" and \"Petrified\" before finishing with the (slightly) more upbeat \"Endlessly.\"  El corazón puede estar adolorido, but in community, the pain never seems hopeless. \n\nAs Apollo's Tiny Desk comes to an end, he offers the audience a homework assignment for self-improvement, for putting the negative behind you and making yourself available to participate in building community: \"I want y'all to think about something,” he says. “I want you to go home, I want you to meditate and I want you to just burn the bridge.\" He laughs. “I’m playing!” But as his and the band’s joyful energy attests, in the world of Omar Apollo, there’s only room for building each other up. \n\nSET LIST\n“En El Olvido”\n“Evergreen”\n“Petrified”\n“Endlessly”\n\nMUSICIANS\nOmar Apollo: vocals\nJonah Feingold: guitar\nJackson Shanks: drums\nManny Barajas: bass\nHarrison Hawkins: keys, music director\nAstyn Turrentine: vocals\nPhylicia Hill: vocals\nBrian Antonio Gazo Martinez: vocals\nFabian Anthony Chavez: saxophone\nMarcus Clayton Paul: trumpet\nSilvia Estrada: guitarrón\nMayra Martínez: guitarrón\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAnimator: Alanté Serene\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Pierre Kattar\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Copeland\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alanté Serene, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #ElTiny #OmarApollo","title":"Omar Apollo: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1093,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220915","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p78XATPcyg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7p78XATPcyg/hqdefault.jpg?v=632258af","content":{"View count":206675}}

It’s why in just one year’s time, he’s already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80’s hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song “Never Comin’ Home” amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, “Fall In Love”, “Rock and A Hard Place”, and “Where It Ends”. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #NeverLeave #LyricVideo","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Never Leave (Lyric Video)","duration":204,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20220915","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmz6EueDmpE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rmz6EueDmpE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":138430}}

It was the final piece needed to confirm the standard model of particle physics as it now stands. There are still many outstanding questions - for example, it seems like nothing in the standard model can explain what dark matter is. So the discovery of the Higgs wasn’t the end of particle physics - but it may be the way forward. Many physicists think that the secret to finding the elusive dark matter particle will come by studying the Higgs. In fact, the first tantalizing evidence is already in.\n\n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\nSearch the Entire Space Time Library Here: https://search.pbsspacetime.com/\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Euan McLean & Matt O'Dowd \nPost Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini, Pedro Osinski, Caique Oliveira, Adriano Leal & Stephanie Faria\nGFX Visualizations: Ajay Manuel\nDirected by Andrew Kornhaber\nAssociate Producer: Bahar Gholipour\nExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew Kornhaber\nExecutive in Charge for PBS: Maribel Lopez\nDirector of Programming for PBS: Gabrielle Ewing\nAssistant Director of Programming for PBS: John Campbell\n\nSpacetime is produced by Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.\nThis program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.\n© 2022 PBS.

{"description":"Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nShe became Queen in 1952 at the age of 25 and spent 70 years on the throne. She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \"it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \"rock\".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign.","title":"Queen Elizabeth II dies aged 96","duration":1369,"channel_id":"UCTrQ7HXWRRxr7OsOtodr2_w","author":"Channel 4 News","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYGByWrjyFw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mYGByWrjyFw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":6185482}}

{"description":"Ferrari once said it would never build an SUV. So what does that make this four-wheel drive newcomer: the Purosangue? In Ferrari’s words, it’s not an SUV or a crossover – it’s a sports car. The first four-door four-seater in Maranello’s history, standing 1,589mm tall. A Range Rover will tower over this like an oak tree.\n \nThanks to a 6.5-litre naturally aspirated V12 mounted behind the front axle under that enormous clamshell bonnet, you’ve got a titanic 715bhp and 528lb ft to enjoy on your way to 8,250rpm. Ferrari says the definitely-not-an-SUV can hit 62mph from rest in 3.3 seconds, scorch from 0-124mph in just 10.6 seconds and top out beyond 192mph. Performance-wise, it’s a supercar.\n \nSo, is the ‘thoroughbred’ another cash-grab-SUV, or the next smash-hit in Ferrari’s recent form of sensational road cars? Join Top Gear magazine’s Ollie Kew for a detailed tour around the looks, under the bonnet and inside the most controversial prancing horse ever made…\n\nMORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:\nWant to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?

Kendall is a successful business founder, international supermodel, founder of the incredibly successful tequila brand, 818, and star on the Hulu’s, the Kardashians, which premieres in second season on September 22nd. \n\nKendal shows us a different side of her as she shares how her curiosity for people with brilliant minds and doing so much to give back to the world has eventually led to this interview. Behind the glamor and spotlight, she especially enjoys having some time alone with herself, and she values the importance of setting boundaries and why we should do things that lead to genuine happiness. We talk about her childhood and her love for animals, how the simple things give her the most joys, getting through grief after losing a dear friend, and finding the heart to be more kind to your inner child.\n\nKendall remains grounded and in tune with her inner goddess and not letting negativity and ill intentions change who she is, who she may become, and the purpose she is living by.  \n\n\nWhat We Discuss:\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:00:26 “I think I manifested this interview…”\n00:09:53 “I grew up in a horse community.”\n00:15:42 Craving the simple things\n00:18:51 Setting boundaries for yourself  \n00:21:46 Putting yourself first\n00:27:15 It’s important to be happy\n00:28:51 Reassuring yourself of who you really are\n00:33:06 Sometimes, family can be overwhelming\n00:35:54 Losing a dear friend\n00:40:53 Finding a new purpose\n00:45:38 Stop being mean to your inner child\n00:50:24 Kendall on Final Five\n\nDo you want to meditate daily with me?

{"description":"Out of the sea, wish I could be... part of that world.\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton,” “Snowpiercer”) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca,” “Room”) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      \n\n“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton,” “In the Heights”), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”), who won two Oscars® for the music in the animated version of “The Little Mermaid,” with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (“Mary Poppins Returns,” “Into the Woods”). Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics are by Howard Ashman and new lyrics are by Lin-Manuel Miranda.","title":"The Little Mermaid - Official Teaser Trailer","duration":83,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20220909","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-wPm99PF9U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0-wPm99PF9U/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":19306958}}
