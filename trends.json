{"description":"My Policeman, coming to select theaters on October 21 and Prime Video on November 4.\n\nA beautifully crafted story of forbidden love and changing social conventions, My Policeman follows three young people – policeman Tom (Harry Styles), teacher Marion (Emma Corrin), and museum curator Patrick (David Dawson)– as they embark on an emotional journey in 1950s Britain. Flashing forward to the 1990s, Tom (Linus Roache), Marion (Gina McKee), and Patrick (Rupert Everett) are still reeling with longing and regret, but now they have one last chance to repair the damage of the past. Based on the book by Bethan Roberts, director Michael Grandage carves a visually transporting, heart-stopping portrait of three people caught up in the shifting tides of history, liberty, and forgiveness.\n \n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

But the truth is that these homes are a lot more difficult to build than you might think.\n\nIt’s easy to think that housing solutions are purely technological, but many obstacles to housing aren’t in construction but in the policies surrounding homebuilding. Moreover, many of the supposed advantages of shipping containers turn out to be more complicated in reality.\n\nVox’s Phil Edwards spent a night in a shipping container home to see how the experience of staying in a shipping container compares with the reality of building one.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nMark Hogan’s 2015 opinion piece about shipping containers is a great introduction to the topic: https://www.archdaily.com/773491/opinion-whats-wrong-with-shipping-container-housing-everything\nBelinda Carr’s debunking of shipping containers gets into more building science detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yEDz6bCfU\nShe’s also an even-handed critic and made a video about five shipping container successes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkG3gmPUPQg\nYou can check out Michael’s Airbnbs here: https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/329149776\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Used Vipers now cost the same as new GT3s. \n\nThe 2022 Porsche 911 GT3 Touring ($228,000 as specced in Canada, ~$180,000 USD converted) and the Dodge Viper GTS ($132,890 when new in Canada, ~$102,570 USD converted) are two absurdly riotous sports cars. A gruesome 8.4L V10 powers the Viper, pushing out 640 pure American horsepower and 600 lb ft of raw torque. The 4.0 L flat-six in the Porsche GT3 Touring screams its way to 9000 rpm, making 502 hp and 347 lb ft of torque - all while singing its own version of the German national anthem. Each car brings something unique to the table; Thomas and James are eager to see what makes each of these cars special. We hope you enjoy the episode! Thanks for watching!

Oh boy, did I take a second look. Specifically, I watched the trailer again and realized that the movie I was advertised was NOT the movie I saw. At ALL!. Is that even LEGAL?

{"description":"Like and subscribe if you enjoyed it!\n\nFollow me on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dreamcastguy\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dreamcastguy\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/dreamcastguy\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/DreamcastGuy\n\n#PS4 #PS5 #PlayStation \n\nThe new, more robust (and more complicated) PlayStation Plus is officially out in North America as of Monday. Sony’s new version of its subscription service now offers three tiers: Essential, Extra, and Premium.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Sony’s new subscription service play, you may be wondering: Is this PlayStation’s version of Xbox’s Game Pass? No, and, well, sort of. The higher-priced tiers do offer a catalog of new and classic games for subscribers, much like Xbox’s service. However, Sony has said it doesn’t plan to add new, first-party releases to PlayStation Plus the day they come out — a major Game Pass perk. The PlayStation Plus Essential tier is the version of PS Plus that’s existed for years. Subscribers will get access to monthly games, multiplayer access, discounts, exclusive content, cloud storage, share play, the PlayStation Plus Collection, game help, and free shipping from PlayStation. As it has been, a month will run players $9.99, a year is $59.99.\n\nThe PlayStation Plus Extra tier ($14.99 monthly/$99.99 yearly) is the enhanced version of the Essential tier. It comes with all the Essential features and only adds a game catalog of 400 first and third-party PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that subscribers can access — although selections will likely rotate in and out as the months go by.\n\nThe PlayStation Plus Premium tier ($17.99 monthly/$119.99 yearly) is the most enhanced version of PlayStation Plus and the most expensive. It comes with all the features in both Essential and Extra. It also adds a classic catalog of PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games, game trials for certain titles, and PlayStation 3 cloud streaming games.\n\nAs for the classic games emulation, American players are getting a better deal than other regions. When PlayStation started rolling out Premium in Asian territories a few months ago, its classic emulators were running the 50 Hz PAL versions of the game. However, in North America the titles are reportedly running the 60 Hz versions — which, practically speaking, means they’ll run faster for American players.","title":"The new PlayStation Plus is CRAZY!

{"description":"In the final round of the 2022 RBC Canadian Open, Rory McIlroy shot an 8-under 62 to get to 19-under par and win his 21st PGA TOUR title by two shots.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nRory McIlroy will look to defend his title this weekend, as the PGA TOUR returns to St George’s Golf and Country Club for the RBC Canadian Open. The course last hosted the tournament in 2010 when Carl Pettersson was victorious. Three years ago, Northern Irishman McIlroy beat the course record to claim victory finishing seven shots clear of second place. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will be looking for a fifth victory this year, having narrowly missed out on another first place finish last weekend in a tense playoff with Sam Burns at the Charles Schwab Challenge. Other notable players teeing up include 2022 PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas, THE PLAYERS Championship winner Cameron Smith as well as Tony Finau, Justin Rose and Tyrell Hatton.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Rory McIlroy's 8-under 62 and 21st victory | Round 4 | RBC Canadian | 2022","duration":365,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20220612","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kllJCMZTqdg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kllJCMZTqdg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":438343}}

Consumer drones in particular have become a crucial tool in the Ukraine war.\n\nHundreds of civilian drone operators have been documenting everything from Russian troop movements to evidence of war crimes.

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 We have COVID & Other News\n01:55 Hike - Nature’s Not Cooperating \n03:40 What's Next\n07:05 All Our Stuff\n09:07 Repair the Line Driver\n16:08 COVID RAT Test \n18:09 Largest Marina in the Southern Hemisphere \n22:33 Replace the Traveler Line\n26:45 The Last Boat Project Complete \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"Last Boat Project As Owners","duration":1681,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220612","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyEeq0yzfXM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UyEeq0yzfXM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":217735}}

We waited about 40 minutes to get into the hotel because of delays. Once you are there, there's really no leaving (but you can if you absolutely 100% need to.  There is no pool in space lol. On the day of the Disney's Hollywood Studios visit, it took us about 1 hour to get to the park because of shuttle delays and we could not take our own transportation but they did end up \"making it right\".  After being home for about 1 week, Chase did say he actually liked the place and wanted to go back.  Shawn wonders if the show is always the same and he wants to check it out again but us other 4 would not need to ever go back to this hotel although it is cool and I think worth doing it once if you 1. like cosplay 2. like Starwars 3. like roleplay and 4. don't mind subjecting your digestive system to LOADS nd LOADS of food coloring. :)  but definitely watch our RECAP review at the end of the vid.\n\n\n📚FGTeeV NY Times Best Selling Books:\n#1 FGTeev Into the Game ➡ https://amzn.to/3lBoPnB\n#2 FGTeeV Saves the World ➡ https://amzn.to/3laHoyA\n& FGTeeV Game Break➡ https://amzn.to/2T5QmRX\n\n🎮FGTeeV Games/Apps:\n🦍APE CHASE ➡ http://smarturl.it/ApeChase\n🔊SOUND BOARD ➡ http://smarturl.it/soundboard\n🧁GOOZY ➡ http://smarturl.it/goozy","title":"We Slept in Outer Space & Betrayed the Space People!

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #travel #travelvlog #sailing\n\n00:00 moving onto a sailboat!\n01:17 who are Riley and Elayna?\n02:15 taking over their boat for 24 hours!\n03:47 world’s best toothpaste 😁\n04:42 FULL TOUR of La Vagabonde ⛵️\n09:42 Van life vs boat life?\n10:25 Can we sail alone?!😱\n14:40 Lifting the anchor!\n16:29 hoisting the SAILS\n25:31 sunset beach bonfire 🔥\n26:27 learning to free dive and spearfish\n27:19 driving the dingy in the dark 🤦🏻‍♀️","title":"24 HOURS LIVING ON A SAIL BOAT (with sailing La Vagabonde)","duration":1762,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220611","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIY4PSilhb4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uIY4PSilhb4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":859477}}

Fjordur contains over 140 square kilometers of new biomes, new challenges, and rewarding discoveries!\n\nTraverse a fantastical multi-layered wonderland with a frosty Nordic theme. Four unique islands, Vardiland, Vannaland, Bolbjord and Balheimr, and the mystical realms; Jotunheim, Vanaheim, and Asgard, offer elaborate cave systems resplendent with Scandinavian ruins and vast monolithic entrances. Take a well-trodden hallowed path to pay respects at the immense and sacred world tree, Yggdrasil.

Black Adam was created by Bill Parker and C.C. Beck.  The film’s producers were Beau Flynn, Dwayne Johnson, Hiram Garcia and Dany Garcia, with Richard Brener, Walter Hamada, Dave Neustadter, Chris Pan, Eric McLeod, Geoff Johns and Scott Sheldon\n\n“Black Adam” smashes into theaters and IMAX internationally beginning 19 October 2022 and in North America on October 21, 2022.
