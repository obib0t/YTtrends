{"description":"Hey guys! Today I attempt to \"Fix The Unfixable\" squishies in my collection. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my \"hopeless bin\" and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!\n\nDON'T FORGET TO GET THE ME PLAYING CARDS:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/p/7422520721599\n\n*available only until March 20th*\n\n________FAQs_________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

Pre-order or buy through April 27 and get the Outdoor Playtime Digital Content**! (This content will become available when the pack launches.) \n \nFamily is at the center of a lot of the choices and milestones your Sim will be faced with in the Growing Together Expansion Pack. For example ‚Äì will they let their parents move in with them? Saying ‚Äòno‚Äô will impact those relationships and saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô could make life at home a lot more complicated. What if your Sim‚Äôs parents don‚Äôt get along with their partner? For you, the choice might be whether you want to keep the peace or stir up some drama. \n \nNew relationships are getting more dynamic too. If your Sim goes out to meet new people, they might find someone they instantly like who they could be friends with for life. Or they could meet a lifelong enemy. Social chemistry will make some Sims click and some Sims clash, and how they navigate these feelings is up to you. \n \nAvailable March 16 at 10 a.m. PT on Origin PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation¬Æ4, and PlayStation¬Æ5 \n \nPre-order today and get ready to enjoy some family fun (with a side of disfunction): https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-growing-together \n \n*Requires The Sims 4 & all game updates.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ‚ñ∫https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ‚ñ∫https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"1 Million Subscribers!

{"description":"üåè Get Exclusive NordVPN deal here ‚û°Ô∏è https://nordvpn.com/kingsandgenerals. It's risk-free with Nord's 30-day money-back guarantee! ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nThanks to Ian Matveev for his excellent analytics: https://twitter.com/ian_matveev\n\nKings and Generals animated historical documentary series on Modern Warfare continues with the aftermath of the first phase of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 (https://youtu.be/yBZPE9o2gHU). Previously we talked about the build-up to the new stage of the Russo-Ukrainian War, how Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine continued, and covered events between February 24th and April 7th, as we saw how Ukraine managed to win the first phase of the war. This set up the second phase of the war - battle of Donbas. In the previous video we covered the events of April of 2022 (https://youtu.be/K2N_fHKrWIg) including the sinking of the rocket cruiser Moskva - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvB2CPpdTMY, and how the conflict turned into the war of attrition in May (https://youtu.be/D-93q4GMFT0) and continued with Russia's best month in June (https://youtu.be/SIm4mQihHdA). In the video dedicated to July - the 5th month of the war, we talked about the arrival of the HIMARS systems which strengthened Ukrainian positions and changed the war (https://youtu.be/WS0D0X8V6rg), while this video will focus on the events of August, as we will see how Russian logistics and manpower problems were worsened by the HIMARS strikes, the risk and intrigue around the Zaporizhia (Enerhodar) Nuclear Powerplant and the long expected beginning of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson (https://youtu.be/2hZoQ4xebGw). Previously we discussed the Kherson counteroffensive in the first 2 weeks of September and showed how the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast - Balakliya-Izium counter-offensive succeeded, pushing the Russians across Oskil and Lyman (https://youtu.be/gJRjKuss_Co) In the second half of September, Ukraine liberated even more territory in Kherson (https://youtu.be/S7usqwT-ty4), while this video will talk about the events of the beginning of October, including the attack on the Crimean - Kerch bridge (https://youtu.be/i4gebic_Wnc). In the second half of October, positional and attritional warfare continued to dominate, still Ukraine managed to attack the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and the Grain Deal was almost cancelled (https://youtu.be/wUAzOsvaX7k), while in the beginning of November, Ukraine finally liberated Kherson (https://youtu.be/sYr5mTNljN8). In the second half of November, winter took over, making the military operation more difficult (https://youtu.be/8r0JfS6WTWs), while in the first half of December, the stalemate continued (https://youtu.be/OOpew0MbJtg). In the second half of December and first half of January, Russia advanced around Bakhmut, taking Soledar (https://youtu.be/TmpWByOr6JQ), while in the second half of January, Russian regained initiative counterattacking on the Kreminna axis and gaining ground around Bakhmut, while the West announced that Ukraine will finally receive Leopard 2, Challenger 2 and Abrams tanks alongside more armoured vehicles (https://youtu.be/eoIbUUPCkKg). Next we will talk about the possible Russian attack vectors and deduce what is the Russian plan for winter and spring of 2023.\n\nPacific War Series: https://youtu.be/MEgIHN63ojU?list=PLaBYW76inbX4kE52CPUvx8gZ7CQyjweEg\nCold War channel: http://bit.ly/2UHebLI\nModern Warfare series: http://bit.ly/2W2SeXF\nBattle of Khalkhin Gol 1939: https://youtu.be/GGwUlET2tbw \nWinter War: https://youtu.be/1Uk5bY22RSE\nGreco-Italian War, Battle of Greece, Battle of Crete: https://youtu.be/_jDBQijICTo\nSoviet Invasion of Afghanistan - Operation Storm-333: https://youtu.be/bpm5dPIULF0\nGerman Raiders in the Pacific: https://youtu.be/JbiWX9pkWns\nBattle of Hong Kong 1941: https://youtu.be/TrqlSSA2xUc\nItalian Raids on Alexandria and Gibraltar: Italian Raids on Alexandria and Gibraltar\nBattle of Taranto 1940: https://youtu.be/Wdbel62kZl0\nSihang Warehouse 1937 - Chinese Thermopylae: https://youtu.be/IxpG19OTmns\n\nSupport us on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals or Paypal: http://paypal.me/kingsandgenerals or by joining the youtube membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMmaBzfCCwZ2KqaBJjkj0fw/join \n\nThe video was made by Leif Sick while the script was developed by Turgut Gambar.

{"description":"Welcome to the Sims 4 a wonderful combinations of memes and life simulator game where you can do whatever you want! Want to have 100 babies sure go for it! Want to trap your entire neighbourhood into a prison of endless suffering? Ok Callmekevin if that's what you want... You can even get into sims 4 mods and live your wildest fantasies of the dlcs we never got until we eventually get the sims 5. (or just use sims 4 cc to fix the game and its many bugs, glitches and exploits)\n\nSo today we are going to see if the sims 4 is too easy by breaking it with 3 very different strategies to attempt to make 1,000,000 simoleons starting with nothing! A rags to riches challenge so to speak! Our 3 strategies today will be \n1. Trapped Artists. \n2. The Friendship Trap. \n3. Fast Fashion\n\nChapters: \n00:00 - Intro\n00:51 - Introducting the Goffs\n04:25 - Life and Death of a Goff\n09.32 - Karl Marx has entered the chat\n11:30 - Selfies = Simoleons\n13:00 - Vampire Bros\n16:05 - Manipulating Mortimer\n17:05 - Money making EXTREME!\n18:50 - Trendsetting\n20:29 - High price fashion\n21:58 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts.

{"description":"ALL OF THOSE VOICES. THE FEATURE LENGTH DOCUMENTARY FILM. IN CINEMAS WORLDWIDE FROM MARCH 22ND: https://allofthosevoices.com\n\nAll Of Those Voices:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/allofthosevoices\nhttps://tiktok.com/@allofthosevoices\nhttps://twitter.com/AOTVFilm\nhttps://www.facebook.com/allofthosevoices\n\nAll Of Those Voices takes a refreshingly raw and real look at Louis Tomlinson's musical journey. Ditching the typical glossy sheen of celebrity documentaries, this film gives audiences an intimate and unvarnished view of Louis' life and career. Through never-before-seen home movie footage and behind the scenes access to Louis‚Äô sell-out 2022 World Tour, All Of Those Voices offers a unique perspective on what it's like to be a musician in today's fast-paced world.\n\nFrom the highs of superstardom to the lows of personal tragedy, Louis' story is one of resilience and determination. The film explores his journey from a member of One Direction to a solo artist, capturing the challenges and triumphs that defined his path. Since the acclaimed release of his debut album ‚ÄòWalls‚Äô and documenting the creation of his chart topping 2022 album ‚ÄòFaith In The Future‚Äô, the film shows a side of Louis that fans have never seen before, as he grapples with the pressures of fame and the weight of his own voice.\n\nDirected by Charlie Lightening, the filmmaker behind the award-winning As It Was, All Of Those Voices is a story about the power of self-discovery and the courage it takes to be true to oneself. With a focus on honesty and vulnerability, this film is a refreshingly down-to-earth take on the life of a musician, capturing the real-life struggles and triumphs of a man who refused to be silenced by anyone else's expectations.\n\nFollow Louis Tomlinson:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Louis_Tomlinson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/louist91\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/louis.tomlinson\nWebsite: https://www.louis-tomlinson.com\n\nFaith In The Future.

{"description":"What does your chosen family look like? Do you resonate with Lilo?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker, filmmaker Alan Seawright, and guest Rebecca Parham of @LetMeExplainStudios are reacting to the beloved Lilo and Stitch. It is Rebecca‚Äôs favorite movie, and it‚Äôs admired by so many for its portrayal of neurodivergent and autistic people. They discuss how Lilo‚Äôs neurodivergence makes her unique but misunderstood by her peers and adults. They discuss the emotional burden of having a broken family and how they heal through their shared value of Ohana. Alan praises Chris Sanders for vocalizing Stitch in a way that‚Äôs monstrous but also cute, and Rebecca gives credit to the directors for doing their research to accurately represent Hawaii and Hawaiian culture. And, of course, they cry. \n\nThank you to our Patrons for picking this episode!

{"description":"Some Washington D.C. lawmakers want to limit Wall Street's role in the housing market. In recent years, a small but mighty group of corporations bought hundreds of thousands of homes in sunbelt-region suburbs. These homes are traditionally a crucial investment for American families. But rising home prices are shutting would-be homebuyers out of the market.  Meanwhile, financial groups are profiting from rising rents while their subsidiaries build small amounts of new standalone homes in the U.S.\n\nSince the early 2010s, Tricon Residential, Progress Residential, American Homes 4 Rent, Invitation Homes have each bought thousands of homes. They've also added to the housing supply in some cases with built-for-rent communities.Some of these companies are financed by private equity firms like Blackstone and investment managers like Pretium Partners.\n\n\"It's almost a captive market\" said Jordan Ash, director of Labor-Jobs and Housing at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. \"They've been very explicit about how people are shut out of the homebuying market and are going to be perpetual renters.\"\n\nThese calls come after fierce housing inflation hit many Sun Belt states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia, according to the National Association of Realtors.¬†\n\nBy 2030, the institutions may hold some 7.6 million homes, or more than 40% of all single-family rentals on the market, according to the 2022 forecast by MetLife Investment Management.\n\nWatch the video above to learn about the rise and future of corporate landlords in the United States.\n\nChapters: \n01:28 ‚Äî Chapter 1: Landlords\n05:02 ‚Äî Chapter 2: Housing stock\n07:55 ‚Äî Chapter 3: Homebuying \n09:46 ‚Äî Chapter 4: Solutions \n\nProduced by: Carlos Waters\nSupervising Producer: Lindsey Jacobson\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\nAdditional Production by: Bryan Rager\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC:¬†https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV:¬†https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

{"description":"A summary of the Jackson Mississippi water crisis to date.\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://go.nebula.tv/practical-engineering\n\nLast August, a flood took out the aging water system in Jackson, Mississippi, leaving nearly everyone in the City without water. Only a few months later, arctic weather broke so many pipes in the city that residents again lost access to water, some for nearly two weeks, continuing one of the worst water crises in American history.\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS\n____________________________________\n2022 Testimony of Abre‚Äô Conner: https://naacp.org/sites/default/files/documents/Abre%27%20Conner%20-%20HS%20Hearing%20Testimony%209.19.22.pdf\nBrooking's Institute Article: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2021/03/26/in-jackson-miss-a-water-crisis-has-revealed-the-racial-costs-of-legacy-infrastructure/\nWhite Flight in Jackson: https://www.mississippifreepress.org/24739/the-fearless-11-the-impact-of-white-flight-and-integration-in-jackson-miss\nMSDH Jackson Water Crisis Webpage: https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/30,0,76,720.html\nEPA Jackson Water Crisis Webpage: https://www.epa.gov/ms/jackson-ms-drinking-water\nMost of the timeline and summary information included in the video comes from this source: https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/U.S.%20v%20City%20of%20Jackson%20MS%20Complaint%20w%20Attachments_Filed.pdf\nMSEMA Incident Command Briefs: https://www.msema.org/jackson-water-crisis-2022/\nIs Water a Human Right? https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/FactSheet35en.pdf\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"One man was killed and four others were injured when a gunman started shooting near the St. Charles Avenue Carnival parade route in New Orleans on Sunday.\n\nThe Krewe of Bacchus was close to the end when gunshots rang out near St. Charles Avenue and Terpsichore Street. New Orleans police say the shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. in front of the Hoshun Restaurant, just steps from where a large crowd lined the street enjoying the Mardi Gras festivities.\n\nThe shooting injured a young girl, a woman, and three men. All five victims were taken to a hospital where one of the men later died.\n\n\"We don't know what happened prior to that, but we did hear gunshots and our officers responded as well as other agencies very quickly. And we were able to find two weapons on scene and also apprehend what we believe to be the shooter,\" NOPD Deputy Chief Hans Ganthier said.\n\nAn eyewitness told WWL-TV that at least a dozen shots were fired and that people were falling all over themselves trying to get out of the way, leaving everything they had behind them. He said prior to the shooting, there was a set of skirmishes in the same area that officers broke up.\n\n\"Everyone ran. Everyone took cover. My whole family ducked. I kind of just hovered over my family, like the small children,\" Andrew Crawford said.\n\nThe Bacchus parade was temporarily halted in the 1500 block of St. Charles Avenue after the shooting. An officer said that the parade would resume to \"get out of the way\" of the crime scene but that they wouldn't throw anything while in that area.\n\n\n\"This is not something we wanted to see. We really wanted to be a safe Mardi Gras and we continue to work toward that end,\" Ganthier said.\n\nThe police department could not say if the man they took into custody was the sole shooter on the parade route. The shooting remains under investigation.\n\nThe NOPD is asking anyone with information about the shooting to call Crimestoppers of Greater New Orleans at 504-822-1111.","title":"Panic after deadly shooting on New Orleans parade route","duration":180,"channel_id":"UCJCreS7pODbA6XYRsI5fdLg","author":"WWLTV","date":"20230220","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTlsS514z1g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YTlsS514z1g/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":438679}}
