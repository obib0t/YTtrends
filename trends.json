We even had to call in special helper Uncle Dave to teach us to weld! In the end MrBeast was stoked with out it turned out and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Now Jimmy will have to find somewhere to put it lol.  This was an insanely stressful and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. Thank you for watching!

{"description":"An overview of the 2022 Montana flooding and what's next for Yellowstone National Park.\nüìÖ Sign up for 80,000 Hours for help finding an impactful and rewarding career today: https://www.80000hours.org/practicalengineering\n\nIn June of 2022, many tourists and residents of the Yellowstone National Park area found themselves at ground zero of a natural disaster. Torrential rainfall in Wyoming and Montana brought widespread flooding to the streams and rivers that flow through this treasured landscape and beyond. How will the National Park Service Rebuild? Hasty engineering of large infrastructure can be extremely damaging to natural systems like those in Yellowstone, and you don‚Äôt want to invest millions of dollars into repairs that might be subject to similar flooding in the future. After all, we build parks (and roads to parks) to get closer to the natural environment and all its wildness, and there‚Äôs almost nothing more natural or wild than a flood.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

LMNT has been a huge supporter of the town, I use it every single day, so I hope you'll check it out!\n\nHey guys, this week was a hard one up here at Cerro Gordo. A \"1,000 year flood\" hit Death Valley right by us and completely washed out our road. Short term, it made it impossible to get up or down the road. Long term, this will mean we cannot get the trucks up the road needed to continue progress on the American Hotel and many other projects. This is an absolutely devastating blow in the series of devastating blows that seems to come with living up here.\n\nThe future of many projects is completely up in the air right now and may push the timeline into the winter, which would mean at least 6-8 months of no progress.

With ceilings stretching over thirteen feet high, the entire tiny home feels beyond the 399sq ft it is.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ‚ñ∫https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ‚ñ∫https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"I Jinxed It With My Overconfidence","duration":1475,"channel_id":"UCp0rRUsMDlJ1meYAQ6_37Dw","author":"Millennial Farmer","date":"20220812","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgMC7xsbH5k","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/TgMC7xsbH5k/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":451209}}
