{"description":"Since 1927, TIME has chosen a Person of the Year, the editors‚Äô assessment of the individual who most shaped the headlines over the previous 12 months, for better or for worse. \n\nAs a tradition, Person of the Year springs from the Great Man Theory of history, a belief that individuals have the power to transform society. The selections over the years have tended to follow certain patterns. The person chosen has typically been a ruler over traditional domains of power. He‚Äîand yes, usually it has been a ‚Äúhe‚Äù‚Äîis very often a politician or a titan of industry. Fourteen U.S. Presidents, five leaders of Russia or the Soviet Union, and three Popes have all been recognized.\n\nAnd yet the person whose singular influence was revealed throughout 2023 has held none of these roles‚Äîor anything remotely similar. Every year contains light and dark; 2023 was a year with significant shares of darkness. In a divided world, where too many institutions are failing, Taylor Swift found a way to transcend borders and be a source of light. No one else on the planet today can move so many people so well. Achieving this feat is something we often chalk up to the alignments of planets and fates, but giving too much credit to the stars ignores her skill and her power. \n\nTaylor Swift is TIME‚Äôs 2023 Person of the Year.\n\nRead more: https://ti.me/4alhkbl\nSubscribe to TIME Breaking News YouTube Channel ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫: https://ti.me/3ROMUXY\nSubscribe to TIME‚Äôs YouTube channel ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://ti.me/subscribe-time\nSubscribe to TIME: https://ti.me/3E3UCqt\nGet the day‚Äôs top headlines to your inbox, curated by TIME editors: http://ti.me/the-brief\nFollow us:\nTwitter: https://ti.me/3xTVwSk\nFacebook: https://ti.me/3xWI2Fg\nInstagram: https://ti.me/3dO9Rcc","title":"Taylor Swift is TIME‚Äôs 2023 Person of the Year","duration":447,"channel_id":"UC8Su5vZCXWRag13H53zWVwA","author":"TIME","date":"20231206","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDXqb1Pub-Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RDXqb1Pub-Q/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":358837}}

{"description":"On satellite imagery, we spotted a village inside a strange crater in Madagascar. We set out to learn how it got there.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRight in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there‚Äôs a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris ‚Äî and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there‚Äôs a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. \n\nWhen we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It‚Äôs a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. \n\nWe got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:\n\nHere is some of Michel J√©brak‚Äôs research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32048440_Resolving_the_Richat_enigma_Doming_and_hydrothermal_karstification_above_an_alkaline_complex\n\nHere is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi‚Äôs original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318723814_Petrogenesis_of_the_Ambohiby_Complex_Madagascar_and_the_role_of_the_Marion_Hotspot_plume\n\nWe also spoke with Stian Rice, author of Famine in the Remaking, who helped us understand more about the history of agriculture in Madagascar:  https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/01/24/madagascars-famine-is-more-than-climate-change/\n\nCheck out Stian‚Äôs book on famine and food systems: https://wvupressonline.com/node/831\n\nNorman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell‚Äôs SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/\n\nCorrection: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilm√© as a professor of geology at the University of Florida. In fact, she is a national coordinator of the Madagascar Program at the World Resources Institute. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

There's only one option left: tentatively keep hitting undo and just pray this doesn't lock the editor up otherwise ALL GONE, and just pray the buffer remembers far back enough to restore the sequence I deleted otherwise ALL GONE. There I sat for thirty minutes hitting ctrl-z as gently as I could, sweat dripping from my furrowed brow, even the mice who live in the walls of my apartment coming out to watch and bite their fingernails or claws or whatever it is mice have, their cheese untouched, their traps empty.... Anyway everything was fine even if I almost soiled myself - the undo function worked and I briefly felt good about living again for the first time in ten years. I am an idiot. Please don't be an idiot like me - back stuff up, I beg ye.\n\nMusic used ‚ñ∫\n\nQueen of the Night - Patrick Hawes, Grace Davidson\n\nSwan Lake, Act II - Tchaikovsky - https://youtu.be/do6Ki6kMq_o?si=hBiUWONTRH_8lkiU\n\nLavender Fields - Aysedeniz Gokcin \n\nDawn of Innocence - Nathalie Bonin\n\n\n\nAnd of course here's your mystery link: https://youtu.be/EITdCWYTn2I?si=JIodXOU4_5bzbLOP","title":"How Long is Now? | Introduction to Metaphysics ü™ê","duration":853,"channel_id":"UCimiUgDLbi6P17BdaCZpVbg","author":"exurb1a","date":"20231205","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HzIlKe--NU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8HzIlKe--NU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":541084}}

{"description":"Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is out now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC! ü•≥\n\nGrab your digital or physical copy and experience every story Night City has to offer. ‚ú®\n\nhttps://cyberpunk.net/buy\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is an open-world, action-adventure RPG containing every story set in Night City, featuring a host of memorable characters including rebellious rockerboy Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) and veteran secret agent Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba). Play as V, a cyberpunk mercenary, and take on the most powerful forces of the city in a fight for glory and survival. Dive into the base game, its critically acclaimed spy-thriller expansion Phantom Liberty, and experience the game-changing Update 2.0 ‚Äî all in one package. Legends are made here. What will yours be?\n\nDescriptive text:\n\nA trailer made up of dynamic cuts between gameplay footage from Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty interspersed with live-action scenes of actors Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba.\n\nGame footage shows the silhouette of Solomon Reed, a dark-skinned man in a brown leather trench coat, shooting a gun at an unseen enemy. Soldiers jump out of an AV into a burning building. An explosion throws President Myers, a white woman in a pantsuit, to the ground. Trauma Team employees defibrillate a woman. A police car explodes.\n\nAn AV flies over a sweeping expanse of Night City. A black title card reads: ‚ÄúAn Unprecedented Revival. The Guardian.‚Äù An enormous pyramid-shaped building glows in Dogtown. In an alleyway, a group of women beat up a man who is lying on the ground. A black title card reads: ‚ÄúAn Unforgettable Open-World Experience. Polygon.‚Äù\n\nInside of a club, Idris Elba wears a black suit jacket and walks forward as he speaks to the camera. In the game, a heavily armed MaxTac unit drops onto the ground from an AV. A MaxTac agent points a gun at V. The trunk of a car is opened to reveal an arsenal of weapons. A red-haired woman winks at V over a roulette table.\n\nKeanu Reeves speaks. In the game, characters dance on a crowded dance floor. Four musicians stand on stage as the audience applauds. A rock band plays on a cramped stage with the Samurai logo behind them. A blue-haired woman looks up at V.\n\nKeanu Reeves walks backwards as he speaks. In Cyberpunk 2077, an intimidating cyborg soldier with red eyes walks past. Dogtown leader Kurt Hansen is trailed by two loyal soldiers. A man covered in implants and with a cybernetic light in his forehead gestures. A woman climbs out of a storage container.\n\nIdris Elba strides forward in the club. In the game, V pierces an enemy‚Äôs chest with two electric blades then knocks another enemy back with a shotgun blast. V drives a sleek Quadra car through Night City streets. A masked enemy swings two glowing red blades at V.\n\nArmed forces exit an AV, guns aimed forward. A powerful pistol blast explodes a motorcycle in mid-air. A silver-skinned woman floats aboveground in a holographic light show. V faces down various enemies and a large battle tank.\n\nThe Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition logo glitches into view. Below are the words ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù.

V approaches a crowded crosswalk in Night City. As they stop, the view dims and an interface with available radio stations takes over the screen. As V selects a station, the interface disappears. V crosses the road.\n\nText reads: Metro. V holds up a metro card in front of a Night City Area Rapid Transit Entrance. A map of the Night City metro appears with a list of available routes to choose from. V selects a station and enters through the gate.

A street race begins and V weaves their way through bullets and aggressive competitors.\n\nText reads: New bikes. V drives through a highway on a motorcycle. Text reads: Improved bike combat. Still on the motorcycle, V wields an electrified axe. They throw the axe at an enemy and drive past as the impact creates a cloud of electricity.\n\nText reads: Hangouts with partners. River, a Native American man with a cybernetic eye approaches V and leans in for a kiss. Judy, a Latina woman with an asymmetrical pink and green haircut, hops onto a pool table. Standing underneath a shower, Kerry Eurodyne washes his hair. He is of Filipino descent, and his arms are covered in full-sleeve tattoos. V strokes the hair of Panam, a biracial woman with black eye makeup and dreadlocks tied up in a messy bun. Next, Panam jumps up and down and waves her hands to the beat.\n\nText reads: Boss fights improvements. Adam Smasher, a cyborg with red eyes, runs towards V, his Sandevistan cyberware making his movements faster than humanly possible.\n\nText reads: New bike tricks.

{"description":"Be sure to check out today‚Äôs episode of Game Theory, where this song features! https://youtu.be/3JZeI9SF0lI\n\nAll new Stupendi-Merch NOW AVAILABLE!\nhttps://freshstore.co/collections/the-stupendium\n\nGame Theory, along with its host Matthew ‚ÄòMatPat‚Äô Patrick, is a channel that every week takes you on a deep dive behind the lore and the science of your favourite games. I‚Äôve never done a collaboration like this before but it was wonderful to get the chance to work with and promote a smaller, up-and-coming channel. I‚Äôve no doubt you‚Äôll all be hearing about them any day now. I see big things!\n\nIn all seriousness though, WOW. As a long-time fan of the theory channels getting to work on this with MatPat and his team was such an honour. This project has been in the works for the longest time and it‚Äôs been so hard to keep it a secret for all this time! (Wondering why there are no Style Theory lyrics? That channel didn‚Äôt exist when this was written!)\n\nI am so incredibly grateful to the whole theory team for this opportunity. In fact, I‚Äôm doubly thankful because when I initially pitched this project to them the idea was that I would have the song to publish on my music platforms but that the music video would go to the Game Theory channel. But after work on the project began MatPat said he wanted to find a way to make sure the collaboration benefited my channel as much as possible, instead gifting the full music video to my channel even though it had been entirely edited by the Game Theory team. (Shout out to the wonderfully talented Tyler Mascola!)\n\nSo, instead a plan was formulated to feature the music video as part of a larger Theory video whilst the full standalone music video would be here! I cannot express enough my gratitude to Matt and the whole team. Every one of them was a joy to work with as we put this together.\n\nSo, if you‚Äôre new here, joining me from today‚Äôs video over on Game Theory, welcome!

{"description":"Mat has returned to the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin Texas, and he‚Äôs got his hands on the all-new Cybertruck! So of course, you know what that means‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs drag race time! \n\nNaturally, there was only one competitor that we had to compare this all-electric pick-up to - the Hummer EV! The question is, which will come out on top? \n\nWell, let‚Äôs check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it‚Äôll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. \n\nThink that‚Äôs heavy? Well, that‚Äôs nothing compared to the Hummer, which comes in at 4,110kg!! Just like the Tesla, the Hummer is equipped with three motors, but it‚Äôs also up on power, producing 1,014hp and 1,485Nm! The price is also slightly higher than the Cybertruck, coming in at around ¬£109,000.\n\nSo how will this one play out? Will the extra tonne of weight prove decisive?
