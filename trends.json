{"description":"The Exorcist: Believer\nOctober 2023\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.   \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own.  \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia Marcum), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil.  \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar¬Æ winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before. \n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela‚Äôs neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela‚Äôs friend.  \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award¬Æ nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.   \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty.  \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment.  \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Y√ºcer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures.  \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever","title":"The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer","duration":183,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230725","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PIxpPMyGcpU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":6840409}}

The ending of the series is now upon us and throughout this video we're gonna be pointing out the easter eggs, comic book call backs and also giving our thoughts on the series as a whole. There's some good and bad things that the seasons done and I wanna give our thoughts on the whole thing.\n\nNow last week was a pretty slow burn with us getting a couple of different plot threads setting up things for this entry. Gi'ah and Varra threw a funeral for Talos and he somehwat got his wish in the end. He wanted to show the president that Skrulls weren't a threat which he accomplished judging off the news reports.\n\nAnyway Gi'ah and Varras part of the entry closed out with them having a shootout with Graviks forces. As for Gravik, he killed Pagon for being a Pagon and we learned his true plan. Alongside wanting to start world War 3 he was also trying to get something known as the harvest. Turned out Nick had collected the Avengers DNA and if I ever get super powers I'm completely f**ked. I wouldnt wish having to collect it on Gravik but yeah...entire room...full of it.\n\nWhat\n\nGoing back to Avengers Endgame it kinda recontextualises Nick Fury's appearance and while he was at the funeral he probably had his agents out in the field picking up the sample.","title":"SECRET INVASION Episode 6 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review, Easter Eggs, Theories And More","duration":1620,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230726","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfMHx8xOHvg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KfMHx8xOHvg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":333845}}

I love Star Wars, Avengers, and have always loved going to the different Disney amusement parks. Since I have a history of doing crazy 50 and 100 hour challenges, I thought what better way to spend 100 hours than visiting every Disney park in the entire world. This meant that I traveled from Disneyland Paris in France to Walt Disney World and Disneyland in the United States followed by Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea, Hong Kong Disneyland, and finished in Shanghai Disneyland Park all while trying to eat the best food and ride the best rides in every single one. This video was an absolute dream come true, but was also insane and super intense to make. Luckily, we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next!\n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one! \nComment ‚ÄúI love Disney!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot All 52 Disneyland Paris Resort Attractions - 2023, But NO SLEEP Until I Do EVERY SINGLE RIDE in Disney World, But Top 10 Fastest Disney Rides in the World - Walt Disney World, Disneyland Paris & More, But Top 10 Best Disney World Rides - Walt Disney World, But Disneyland Paris - Complete Walkthrough with Rides - 4K - with Captions, But Every ride at Disneyland, But Top 10 Fastest Rides at Disneyland Paris, But I Rode EVERY Disneyland Ride in One Day  or any other video like Prowalk Tours, FreshBaked!, Alpharad, TPMvids, AllEars.net, Disney Parks Addict, Unspeakable, Ryan Trahan, Preston, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.
