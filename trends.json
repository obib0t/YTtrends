{"description":"I picked up a tent that attaches to the back of an SUV to see if this would fly in a Walmart parking lot. Many Walmart's have stopped allowing camping, but there are still a few out there that let you camp for one night. I set up the tent on the edge of the parking lot and hunkered down for the night with my slow cooker meal.\n\nWebsite: https://campingwithsteve.com\nMy Amazon store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/stevewallis\nMerch: https://crowdmade.com/collections/stevewallis\n\nGear: \n\nDrone: DJI Mini 3 Pro\nhttps://amzn.to/44Uqg4I\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha FX3\nhttps://amzn.to/3SIMQra\n\nLens: Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G\nhttps://amzn.to/3SL1rm7\n\nEditing: Apple 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Final Cut Pro\nhttps://amzn.to/3YeuCiy\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSocials: \n‚Ä¢ Facebook: https://facebook.com/campingwithsteve\n‚Ä¢ Instagram: https://instagram.com/campingsteve\n‚Ä¢ Twitter: https://twitter.com/hunkerdownsteve\n‚Ä¢ TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@campingwithsteve\n----------------------------------------------------------------","title":"SUV Tent Walmart Camping","duration":1772,"channel_id":"UCSnqXeK94-iNmwqGO__eJ5g","author":"Steve Wallis","date":"20230601","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoqtUVo9rfE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoqtUVo9rfE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":454709}}

The area had a large fallen tree in it that I burnt into 3 pieces and rolled out of the way with logs as levers. I may build a hut in this area and so cleared it.\nNext, I dug a pit to mix clay in and collected the new source of clay. The old brick mold (made in a previous video) was used to make 50 bricks that were then allowed to dry. \nWhile this was happening I dismantled the old kiln and used its bricks to make a new one. The new configuration uses only 74 bricks instead of the previous 100, a significantly simpler design. Its firebox is formed by crisscrossing 2 layers of bricks so that air enters in the first layer channels and wood enters the 2nd layer channels at right angles to the first. The new kiln has 3 firing holes instead of the previous 2 of the last design. The new design also has all the bricks stacked on their sides so there is less chance of breakage.\nI fired the bricks and the kiln went ok. There were some cold spots at the top but this may be due to the fact I used less wood than usual, with the firing only taking 2.5 hours (ran out of wood). 3 hours would be better and more wood should be collected beforehand ( a 75x75x100cm pile as opposed to 75x75x75cm pile used this time). The bricks in the coldest area still passed a water test without dissolving though, so it was a success.\nAsh from the firring was made into bricks for storage as they can be used for mortar by calcining (firing in the kiln) later and mixing with sand and water.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"The Miami Heat managed to hold off the Boston Celtics from making a 3-0 comeback, securing their second trip to the NBA Finals in five years, their first appearance since the 2020 NBA Bubble Finals.\n\nThe Miami Heat have executed despite not having a star-studded roster outside of Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. Head Coach Erik Spoelstra is making a convincing case to be the best coach in the entire league, putting players like Caleb Martin and Gabe Vincent into positions where they can succeed. The Caleb Martin game 7 performance was what ultimately helped elevate them to the win. Erik Spoelstra managed to navigate the Gabe Vincent injury masterfully.\n\nThe success of guys like Caleb Martin highlights the importance of maximizing undrafted talent and knowing how to use guys in ways that maximizes their strengths. The Miami Heat do this arguably better than any other team in the NBA. It's what made Heat vs Celtics such a contentious matchup, and why the Celtics had such a hard time handling it.\n\nEven guys like Haywood Highsmith getting significant run, defending premiere players like Jayson Tatum, is a testament to how the Miami Heat keep a big toolbox of players for any given scenario. Even when Jimmy Butler was struggling, they had guys who could step up. Jayson Tatum's injury was certainly something that might've helped, but the Boston Celtics just didn't step up. This win officially made them the first 8th seed in NBA history to make the NBA Finals in a non-lockout season.\n\n‚û• ùôéùô™ùôóùô®ùôòùôßùôûùôóùôö: https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexHoops?sub_confirmation=1\n‚û• ùôèùô¨ùôûùô©ùô©ùôöùôß: https://twitter.com/AlexHoops_\n‚û• ùòΩùôöùôòùô§ùô¢ùôö ùôñ ùôãùôñùô©ùôßùô§ùô£: https://patreon.com/AlexHoops\n\n‚û• ùôñùôóùô§ùô™ùô© ùô¢ùôö\nProviding NBA analysis by making film digestible and using analytics thoughtfully to contextualize on-court production.

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to the final installment of our Nordic/Scandinavian trip - the Glass Igloos in Finland! So far on our trip, we have taken a communal hot bath at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland, nearly cryogenically frozen ourselves at the ICEHOTEL in Sweden, and now we're on to Arctic Finland to stay in a glass igloo under the northern lights!\n\nFor years, I've been seeing the glass igloos in Finland on my instagram, tiktok - **and YouTube shorts** feeds - and I've always wanted to try them out. I've never seen the northern lights before, and I've also never stayed in a human-sized terrarium before, but I've always been intrigued by those see-through bubble tents - so we decided to go and try one out and see if we freeze our butts off! And while at Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort, home of the glass igloos, we also tried a bunch of arctic activities - like snowmobiling, reindeer sleigh rides, dog sledding, and traditional Finnish sauna-ing and ice bathing!! \n\nWhat do you think??
