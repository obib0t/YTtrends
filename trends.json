{"description":"Welcome to the ULTIMATE petrol vs electric drag race! \n\nWe’ve got our hands on the all-new Tesla Cybertruck, and it’s lining up alongside the a Lamborghini Urus! But which will come out on top - petrol, or electric? \n\nWell, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. It also has a top speed of 130mph. \n\nThen we have the Lambo. It’s packing a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet, and this can produce 650hp and 850Nm of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-speed torque converter gearbox, and it’s a whole lot lighter than the Tesla, tipping the scales at 2,200kg.

{"description":"From the executive producers of Band of Brothers and The Pacific comes Masters of the Air. The 9-part series event premieres January 26 https://apple.co/_MastersOfTheAir\n\nBased on Donald L. Miller’s book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff, “Masters of the Air” follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the “Bloody Hundredth”) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich, is at the heart of “Masters of the Air.” Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.\n\nThe series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle and Nate Mann, who are joined by Raff Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, \"Masters of the Air\" is executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Television, and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman for Playtone. Amblin Television’s Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey co-executive produce alongside Playtone’s Steven Shareshian. In addition to writing, Orloff co-executive produces. Graham Yost also serves as co-executive producer. Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees and Tim Van Patten serve as directors.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

Ali’s unique style of stand-up began behind the walls of incarceration, an incubator for interesting experiences and good stories.  \n \nPeople received their first taste of Ali Siddiq when he appeared on HBO's DEF COMEDY JAM and LIVE FROM GOTHAM, and in 2013 he was named Comedy Central's \"#1 Comic to Watch\".  In 2014, Ali impressed comedy enthusiasts by displaying his ability to captivate an audience with his \"Mexicans Got On Boots\" tale, descriptive storytelling, with over 15 million views, of a prison riot on THIS IS NOT HAPPENING, the first of three appearances.  His stories continued with his HALF HOUR special, which premiered on Comedy Central in the fall of 2016.  Immediately following the premiere of that special, Comedy Central offered Ali an hour-special where he performed for inmates live in a Texas jail, sending Ali back to where it all started. The hour special, Ali Siddiq: It’s Bigger Than These Bars, premiered in February 2018 on Comedy Central.  In 2019, Ali could be seen as a Top 5 finalist on NBC’s BRING THE FUNNY. Most recently, Ali could be seen as a guest on THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE.","title":"Home Depot | Ali Siddiq Stand Up Comedy","duration":301,"channel_id":"UCp1m5biWDhP6ogRCpD-qKpw","author":"Ali Siddiq","date":"20231205","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgwPpHzi_3Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dgwPpHzi_3Q/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":143443}}

Lots of that time was faffing around with a Word document, not even sure what the point of the script was, but anyhow - today, very excited to be finally uploading and rid of the thing, there I was doing a bit of last minute polishing in the video editor and suddenly I notice I've deleted half the video in the timeline. Just gone. I reload the old save file but it's too late, I've written over it already. About a month of work gone in three seconds of mis-clicking. I'm not sure how far back in the day I made the mistake and did I mention that the file is so large now that the undo function locks the video editor up almost every time? There's only one option left: tentatively keep hitting undo and just pray this doesn't lock the editor up otherwise ALL GONE, and just pray the buffer remembers far back enough to restore the sequence I deleted otherwise ALL GONE. There I sat for thirty minutes hitting ctrl-z as gently as I could, sweat dripping from my furrowed brow, even the mice who live in the walls of my apartment coming out to watch and bite their fingernails or claws or whatever it is mice have, their cheese untouched, their traps empty.... Anyway everything was fine even if I almost soiled myself - the undo function worked and I briefly felt good about living again for the first time in ten years. I am an idiot.

{"description":"Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is out now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC! 🥳\n\nGrab your digital or physical copy and experience every story Night City has to offer. ✨\n\nhttps://cyberpunk.net/buy\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is an open-world, action-adventure RPG containing every story set in Night City, featuring a host of memorable characters including rebellious rockerboy Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) and veteran secret agent Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba). Play as V, a cyberpunk mercenary, and take on the most powerful forces of the city in a fight for glory and survival. Dive into the base game, its critically acclaimed spy-thriller expansion Phantom Liberty, and experience the game-changing Update 2.0 — all in one package. Legends are made here. What will yours be?\n\nDescriptive text:\n\nA trailer made up of dynamic cuts between gameplay footage from Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty interspersed with live-action scenes of actors Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba.\n\nGame footage shows the silhouette of Solomon Reed, a dark-skinned man in a brown leather trench coat, shooting a gun at an unseen enemy. Soldiers jump out of an AV into a burning building. An explosion throws President Myers, a white woman in a pantsuit, to the ground. Trauma Team employees defibrillate a woman. A police car explodes.\n\nAn AV flies over a sweeping expanse of Night City. A black title card reads: “An Unprecedented Revival. The Guardian.” An enormous pyramid-shaped building glows in Dogtown. In an alleyway, a group of women beat up a man who is lying on the ground. A black title card reads: “An Unforgettable Open-World Experience. Polygon.”\n\nInside of a club, Idris Elba wears a black suit jacket and walks forward as he speaks to the camera. In the game, a heavily armed MaxTac unit drops onto the ground from an AV. A MaxTac agent points a gun at V. The trunk of a car is opened to reveal an arsenal of weapons. A red-haired woman winks at V over a roulette table.\n\nKeanu Reeves speaks. In the game, characters dance on a crowded dance floor. Four musicians stand on stage as the audience applauds. A rock band plays on a cramped stage with the Samurai logo behind them. A blue-haired woman looks up at V.\n\nKeanu Reeves walks backwards as he speaks. In Cyberpunk 2077, an intimidating cyborg soldier with red eyes walks past. Dogtown leader Kurt Hansen is trailed by two loyal soldiers. A man covered in implants and with a cybernetic light in his forehead gestures. A woman climbs out of a storage container.\n\nIdris Elba strides forward in the club. In the game, V pierces an enemy’s chest with two electric blades then knocks another enemy back with a shotgun blast. V drives a sleek Quadra car through Night City streets. A masked enemy swings two glowing red blades at V.\n\nArmed forces exit an AV, guns aimed forward. A powerful pistol blast explodes a motorcycle in mid-air. A silver-skinned woman floats aboveground in a holographic light show. V faces down various enemies and a large battle tank.\n\nThe Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition logo glitches into view. Below are the words “Buy Now”. The game is available for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.","title":"Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition — Official Launch Trailer","duration":62,"channel_id":"UC4zyoIAzmdsgpDZQfO1-lSA","author":"Cyberpunk 2077","date":"20231205","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugb80d5lxEM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ugb80d5lxEM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1977663}}

Klatt then goes through how the sport got to this point with the era of the 4-team Playoff format and how it has hurt the sport as a whole.

In the dangerous district of Dogtown, you must forge alliances within a web of shattered loyalties and sinister political machinations. Do you have what it takes to survive?\n\nLearn more: https://www.cyberpunk.net/phantom-liberty\n\nDescriptive text:\n\nRated M for Mature. Text reads: Radioport. V approaches a crowded crosswalk in Night City. As they stop, the view dims and an interface with available radio stations takes over the screen. As V selects a station, the interface disappears. V crosses the road.\n\nText reads: Metro. V holds up a metro card in front of a Night City Area Rapid Transit Entrance. A map of the Night City metro appears with a list of available routes to choose from. V selects a station and enters through the gate. A digital glitch covers the screen and V appears inside of a crowded metro cart. They turn around and watch the Night City skyline pass by.\n\nText reads: New Car - Porsche 911 Cabriolet. Johnny Silverhand, wearing a bulletproof vest and dog tags smokes a cigarette in front of the Porsche. The front half of the car is painted black and features a large Samurai logo decorating its hood. The back half is painted a neon yellow and covered with various stickers.\n\nText reads: Replayable car races. A street race begins and V weaves their way through bullets and aggressive competitors.\n\nText reads: New bikes. V drives through a highway on a motorcycle. Text reads: Improved bike combat. Still on the motorcycle, V wields an electrified axe. They throw the axe at an enemy and drive past as the impact creates a cloud of electricity.\n\nText reads: Hangouts with partners. River, a Native American man with a cybernetic eye approaches V and leans in for a kiss. Judy, a Latina woman with an asymmetrical pink and green haircut, hops onto a pool table. Standing underneath a shower, Kerry Eurodyne washes his hair. He is of Filipino descent, and his arms are covered in full-sleeve tattoos. V strokes the hair of Panam, a biracial woman with black eye makeup and dreadlocks tied up in a messy bun. Next, Panam jumps up and down and waves her hands to the beat.\n\nText reads: Boss fights improvements. Adam Smasher, a cyborg with red eyes, runs towards V, his Sandevistan cyberware making his movements faster than humanly possible.\n\nText reads: New bike tricks. V catches some air on a motorcycle and does a full 360 flip.\n\nOverlaid text reads: More to discover. V leans toward a pair of tourist binoculars and looks at Night City through them. A list of new features available in Update 2.1 appear: Metro. Hangouts with partners. Radioport. New vehicles. Improved bike combat. New bike tricks. Replayable car races. Additional car chases. Newly opened highway. Vista points. Boss fights improvements. VFX and lighting improvements. And more to discover.\n\nThe Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition logo glitches onto screen.

{"description":"Be sure to check out today’s episode of Game Theory, where this song features! https://youtu.be/3JZeI9SF0lI\n\nAll new Stupendi-Merch NOW AVAILABLE!\nhttps://freshstore.co/collections/the-stupendium\n\nGame Theory, along with its host Matthew ‘MatPat’ Patrick, is a channel that every week takes you on a deep dive behind the lore and the science of your favourite games. I’ve never done a collaboration like this before but it was wonderful to get the chance to work with and promote a smaller, up-and-coming channel. I’ve no doubt you’ll all be hearing about them any day now. I see big things!\n\nIn all seriousness though, WOW. As a long-time fan of the theory channels getting to work on this with MatPat and his team was such an honour. This project has been in the works for the longest time and it’s been so hard to keep it a secret for all this time! (Wondering why there are no Style Theory lyrics? That channel didn’t exist when this was written!)\n\nI am so incredibly grateful to the whole theory team for this opportunity. In fact, I’m doubly thankful because when I initially pitched this project to them the idea was that I would have the song to publish on my music platforms but that the music video would go to the Game Theory channel. But after work on the project began MatPat said he wanted to find a way to make sure the collaboration benefited my channel as much as possible, instead gifting the full music video to my channel even though it had been entirely edited by the Game Theory team. (Shout out to the wonderfully talented Tyler Mascola!)\n\nSo, instead a plan was formulated to feature the music video as part of a larger Theory video whilst the full standalone music video would be here! I cannot express enough my gratitude to Matt and the whole team. Every one of them was a joy to work with as we put this together.\n\nSo, if you’re new here, joining me from today’s video over on Game Theory, welcome! I hope you like what you find!\n\nA̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶b̶s̶o̶l̶u̶t̶e̶l̶y̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶.̶\n\n#gametheory #matpat\n\n-----\nCheck out the full Stupendium originals playlist for all of my original songs!\n\nSTUPENDIUM ORIGINALS: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA&si=dAL0rsUtYfPoESB5\n\nTHE STUPENDIUM ON SPOTIFY:\nhttp://bit.ly/Stupendify\n\nTHE STUPENDIUM ON iTUNES:\nhttp://bit.ly/StupendiTunes\n\nLyrics and vocals by The Stupendium\nVideo by The Stupendium and Theorist Media\nEdited by Tyler Mascola\nShoot Coordinator: Lizzy CJ\nTrack produced by @OxygenBeats \n\n-----\n\nYou can support The Stupendium on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/thestupendium\n\nGrab your official Stupendium Merchandise!

{"description":"Mat has returned to the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin Texas, and he’s got his hands on the all-new Cybertruck! So of course, you know what that means… It’s drag race time! \n\nNaturally, there was only one competitor that we had to compare this all-electric pick-up to - the Hummer EV! The question is, which will come out on top? \n\nWell, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. \n\nThink that’s heavy? Well, that’s nothing compared to the Hummer, which comes in at 4,110kg!! Just like the Tesla, the Hummer is equipped with three motors, but it’s also up on power, producing 1,014hp and 1,485Nm! The price is also slightly higher than the Cybertruck, coming in at around £109,000.\n\nSo how will this one play out? Will the extra tonne of weight prove decisive?

{"description":"In this world-exclusive comprehensive First Review of the Tesla Cybertruck, Jason Cammisa tests Tesla’s Cyberbeast — in acceleration, handling, maneuverability, dent-resistance, and safety — and races it down the ¼-mile against the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD and GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup.\n\n==\nThis episode of “Jason Cammisa on the ICONS” is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nFor more info on the Cybertruck, watch Jason's \"Carmudgeon Show\" podcast here: https://youtu.be/NjIPEtegPt4\n\nNo episode of the multiple award-winning series “ICONS” would be complete without a full helping of comedy, two side dishes of crazy action, and a cast of supporting characters. In this case, the latter incudes a 1988 Lamborghini LM002, a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12, a Ford Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV Pickup! \n\nSpecial guest appearances include Hall-of-Fame race-car driver Randy Pobst and \"Engineering Explained\" host Jason Fenske.\n\nCammisa explains the engineering behind Tesla's controversial pickup truck, including its stainless-steel (\"HFS\") exoskeleton construction, enormous aluminum castings and structural battery pack. He attends a live side-impact crash test in Tesla's Crash Lab that demonstrated how tough the skin is. And then, of course, tries to dent it with a sledgehammer. Or BFH, for those who know.\n\nThe similarities with the DeLorean go way beyond the stainless exterior — in fact, the Cybertruck most closely resembles the famed Lamborghini LM002 pickup — a V12-powered dogleg 5-speed off-roader, dubbed \"Rambo Lambo,\" that was as fast as a sports car. In fact, Jason reads an excerpt from the original Car and Driver magazine review of the LM002, and everything said applies directly to the Cybertruck.\n\nIncluding that the Cybertruck Cyberbeast is the quickest-accelerating pickup truck in history. Watch as it leaves the previous champion (the Rivian R1T) for dead, hitting 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and blasting through the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds at 119 mph. Cammisa reran the test on untreated (non-VHT) asphalt and got the same numbers — and marvels at how consistently the Cybertruck accelerated. Even with the Battery SoC in the mid-30-percent range after hours of consecutive runs, it still hit 60 in 2.6 seconds, and had only lost 0.3s at the quarter mile.\n\nThat newfound consistency is partially due to the new 4680 Gen 2 batteries, which are far larger than Tesla's previous 18650 and 2170 batteries, and are manufactured in-house.\n\nThe Cybertruck is nearly twice as efficient as the Hummer EV, thanks to a Lotus-like obsession with efficiency. With a battery pack of just 123 kWh, it's expected to receive an EPA Range of over 310 miles. \n\nAnd the Cybertruck is even lighter than the Rivian R1T, Hummer, and Lightning — Cammisa weighed them all. \n\nCURB WEIGHT:\nCybertruck Cyberbeast  6717 lb\nRivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD 6777 lb\nFord F-150 Lightning 6813 lb\nGMC Hummer EV First Edition 9316 lb\nLamborghini LM002 6499 lb (with 20 gallons of fuel)\n\nOf course, don't miss Randy Pobst in a kart chasing the Cybertruck around Sonoma Raceway's Go-Kart track — or the sight of the LM002 leaning over like it's about to roll down Sonoma's famed Carousel. Or Jason backing into a stainless steel refrigerator because the Cybertruck's rear visibility is so compromised.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Cybertruck Is Real!\n1:18 Why The Cybertruck Looks Like It Does\n2:18 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs Rivian R1T Quad-Motor\n3:50 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs GMC Hummer EV\n4:25 Quickest Pickup In History: 0-60 in 2.6!\n5:20 Tesla's Engineering Efficiency\n6:23 Refrigerator Aerodynamics\n7:35 New 4860 Gen 2 Batteries\n8:11 Tesla's Price Cuts — Vertical Integration\n9:25 Jason Fenske on the Benefits of High Voltage\n10:14 48 Volts!\n11:07 How To Engineer a 48 Volt Vehicle\n11:24 Steer By Wire\n12:06 Turning Radius and Steering Demonstration\n13:07 Cybertruck vs. Go-Kart (maneuverability demo)\n16:02 One Million Pre-Orders\n16:33 Similarities to Delorean DMC-12\n17:44 Sledgehammer Door Ding Test\n18:08 Bulletproof HFS: \"Hard F-ing Steel\"\n18:44 Cybertruck Crash Test\n19:28 Tesla's Safety Record\n20:06 Pedestrian Impact Protection\n20:38 I hate it.

{"description":"This is her Odyssey. #Furiosa - Only in Theaters 2024\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Academy Award-winning mastermind George Miller’s “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” the much-anticipated return to the iconic dystopian world he created more than 30 years ago with the seminal “Mad Max” films.  Miller now turns the page again with an all-new original, standalone action adventure that will reveal the origins of the powerhouse character from the multiple Oscar-winning global smash “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  The new feature from Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures is produced by Miller and his longtime partner, Oscar-nominated producer Doug Mitchell (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Babe”), under their Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner. \n\nAs the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus.  Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.  While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.\n\nTaylor-Joy stars in the title role, and along with Hemsworth, the film also stars Alyla Browne and Tom Burke. \n\nMiller penned the script with “Mad Max: Fury Road” co-writer Nico Lathouris.  Miller’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris, director of photography Simon Duggan (“Hacksaw Ridge,” “The Great Gatsby”), composer Tom Holkenborg, sound designer Robert Mackenzie, editor Eliot Knapman, visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson and colorist Eric Whipp. The team also includes other longtime collaborators: production designer Colin Gibson, editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, each of whom won an Oscar for their work on “Mad Max: Fury Road.” \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, A Kennedy Miller Mitchell Production, A George Miller Film, “Furiosa.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, in theaters only nationwide on May 24, 2024 and internationally beginning on May 22, 2024.","title":"FURIOSA : A MAD MAX SAGA | OFFICIAL TRAILER #1","duration":146,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

This is one of my favorite songs I have every written. Thank you for taking the time and continuing to allow me to use my platform to spread positivity through impactful music for the people.
