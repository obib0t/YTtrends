{"description":"Watch #highlights  from the main event of #taylorlopez featuring #teofimolopez   In the fight, Teofimo Lopez upset Taylor to win the Jr. Welterweight Title\n\nNext up for Top Rank Boxing, Early fireworks await this Fourth of July weekend as Toledo's knockout king heads home to headline an action-packed heavyweight doubleheader featuring a quartet of the division’s hardest-hitting punchers.\n \nJared “The Real Big Baby” Anderson will collide against Kazakhstan’s Zhan Kossobutskiy in a 10-round main event Saturday, July 1, at Toledo’s Huntington Center. Anderson will fight for the first time as a pro in his hometown, just a few days shy of the 104th anniversary of Jack Dempsey’s historic win over Jess Willard on July 4, 1919, at Toledo’s Bay View Park. Dempsey's triumph heralded a new era in his illustrious career, and Anderson expects to do the same in his first headlining attraction.\n \nIn the 10-round heavyweight co-feature, Montreal-based wrecking ball Arslanbek Makhmudov takes on Nigeria’s Raphael Akpejiori. The Makhmudov-Akpejiori showdown rounds out a doubleheader featuring four undefeated knockout artists with a combined record of 64 wins and 61 stoppages. Anderson-Kossobutskiy and Makhmudov-Akpejiori will be broadcast live on ESPN, ESPN Deportes and ESPN+ at 10 p.m. ET/7 p.m. PT.\n\nTry ESPN+ For Free: https://watch.espnplus.com/toprank/\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel to get notified about the latest highlights, free full fights, and fight week content as it's posted.\n\nFollow Top Rank on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/trboxing\nFollow Top Rank on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/toprank\nLike Top Rank on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/trboxing","title":"Teofimo Lopez Upsets Josh Taylor to Win Jr. Welterweight Title | FIGHT HIGHLIGHTS","duration":249,"channel_id":"UCbzRzJNHx7ZLlJML9BjZQVQ","author":"Top Rank Boxing","date":"20230611","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTmgJ0CCfOs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XTmgJ0CCfOs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":843961}}

The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.\n\nSubscribe to DisneyMusicVEVO 🔔 for all the latest Disney music videos: https://www.youtube.com/@DisneyMusicVEVO?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Disney Music: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic\n\nMusic video by Halle performing Part of Your World (From \"The Little Mermaid\"). © 2023 Walt Disney Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/j1wPSQ","title":"Halle - Part of Your World (From \"The Little Mermaid\")","duration":215,"channel_id":"UCgwv23FVv3lqh567yagXfNg","author":"DisneyMusicVEVO","date":"20230609","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf7Dss2gCe0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kf7Dss2gCe0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1341651}}

{"description":"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nNikki Birch | June 9, 2023\nI was working late when Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds first arrived at the office to rehearse for his Tiny Desk concert. Within moments, it was clear it would be an exceptional performance. The next day, my colleagues waited patiently to see the legendary singer, songwriter and producer. Because when it comes to matters of the heart, Babyface has turned our angst, our triumphs, our devastation, into timeless love songs that have scored the romances of more than one generation.\n\nJoined by top-tier talent — Tank, Chanté Moore and Avery Wilson — Babyface came out swinging. From the songs that put him on the map, to those he wrote or produced for other icons, around the room hit after hit was met with swoons, sighs and not a few tears. (Ok, maybe that was just me.)\n\nBabyface is a titan of the music industry: with numerous top 10 hits, 12 Grammys (50 nominations) and a jaw-dropping roster of collaborations. In 2022, he assembled a stellar ensemble of women for one of my favorite albums of the year, Girls Night Out. To watch this master of pen and sound behind the Tiny Desk was truly epic and nothing short of a dream come true.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Two Occasions\"\n\"Whip Appeal\"\n\"Superwoman\"\n\"Take A Bow\"\n\"Not Gon' Cry\"\n\"Can We Talk\"\n\"Change the World\"\n\"Thnks fr th Mmrs\"\n\"I'll Make Love To You\"\n\"End Of The Road\"\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds: vocals, keys, guitar \nErskine Hawkins III: keys, music director\nAntoine Porter: guitar \nWalt Barnes Jr.: bass\nReggie Regg: drums \nTank: vocals \nChanté Moore: vocals \nAvery Wilson: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter \nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna \nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #babyface","title":"Babyface: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1782,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230609","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eHc0Xz_Hio","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3eHc0Xz_Hio/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":851373}}

{"description":"Disney World really is a kingdom.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nHave you ever wondered why Disney World is located where it is? Or how it came to be such a massive, self-contained universe? It’s a story that involves secret land deals, special districts, and, now, a corporation and a government locked in a feud.\n\nThe story of why Disney World is in Florida marries business and governmental concerns about the creation of the massive property. The engineering ranges from unique physical construction (like the creation of a lake) to unique legal construction (like the creation of a self-running government that could even build its own sewer system).\n\nFurther Reading:\nBuying Disney’s World (https://www.amazon.com/Buying-Disneys-World-Florida-Swampland/dp/1733642056) by Aaron H. Goldberg is an authoritative work about the purchase of Disney. Drawing from corporate records, internal histories, and more, it’s a comprehensive narrative about Disney World’s creation and early years.\n\nThere are a lot of great Disney fan websites out there that are obsessive in their Disney coverage. I found Jim Hill’s history of Reedy Creek to be a good intro to the topic. (https://jimhillmedia.com/history-reedy-creek-improvement-district-part-1/)\n\nDisney news is also vibrant on YouTube. Mickey Views provides good perspective on the current battles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MickeyViews/videos\n\nFor the latest news and updates about the DeSantis-Disney conflict: bit.ly/3oOHz75\n\nVox is an explanatory newsroom on a mission to help everyone understand our weird, wonderful, complicated world, so that we can all help shape it.

It has a bit more ‘sparkle’ and refinement, but this will ONLY be appreciated if the final speakers are given a signal from a high-quality output source like a dedicated DAC.\n\nIf you want to print the baffles, the recommended magnet size is 10mm diameter round neodymium magnets, with 5mm depth maximum.\n\n\nFixtures and fittings:\n\n\n40pcs M3 threaded inserts (for the speaker drivers)\n40pcs 3mm x 8mm countersunk m3 black screws (for the speaker drivers)\n200pcs Self-tapping 2mm diameter screws, 10mm length max (build platform screws)\n24pcs 3mm diameter self-tapping screws (amplifier screws, DSP chamber, midtone chamber base)\n2x step-down voltage regulators, 5v output (for powering the DSP and fan)\n2x 1000uf capacitor (add across the output of the regulator to reduce interference)\n2x Power Adapters (100w ideally, each. A low cost option is old laptop power adapters)\n1x roll of 16awg wire\n\nRecommended glue is CT1 - it sticks to PLA well enough and doesn't set too quickly allowing the whole speaker to be screwed together before it begins to dry. This allows any spill over to be wiped away (use an old brush to get inside the air guide etc). Sets with some amout of flexibility. Readily availabe in the UK but not sure about equivalents for other territories. Visit the Forum or Discord server to see what the community recommends for each region.\n\nSAFETY NOTES ON PLASTER OF PARIS: If you're stupid with it, it can be dangerous. NEVER put your hands/feet/whatever into plaster of paris EVER. It can suddenly set without warning, creating a lot of heat in the center, so you'll get burned or worse. Because of this never leave a batch of wet plaster of paris in reach of children or pets. Wearing a mask is recommended to not breathe in any dust, and goggles to stop it splashing into your eyes.

The next on the list is The Little Mermaid! Because they WILL do to every animated movie they’ve ever released. They will.\n\nThe Little Mermaid definitely raises some questions. Like why do all the creatures have to look so real? Why is Flounder scary? If Ursula can just lie and cheat, why even bother with a deal? Did Eric actually fall in love or was he just under the spell of the Siren call? How many of these remakes are left?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Little Mermaid!\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nThe Mandalorian Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cQeT-vLiwE\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fbBhcK0CDg\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PitchMeeting\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/","title":"The Little Mermaid (2023) Pitch Meeting","duration":324,"channel_id":"UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g","author":"Pitch Meeting","date":"20230608","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNiCTmwr4sA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hNiCTmwr4sA/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":750132}}

Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents.

{"description":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) 6th Mini Album [HARMONY : ALL IN]\n‘JUMP’ MV\n\n[Apple Music] : https://music.apple.com/kr/album/jump/1690536589?i=1690536590\n[Melon] : https://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=11260282\n[Spotify] : https://open.spotify.com/album/67nhgkEfNwdqQt7QFYHw0B\n\nP1Harmony(피원하모니)는 ‘부조화(DISHARMONY)’ 3부작 시리즈부터 ‘조화(HARMONY)’ 시리즈까지 우리를 규정짓는 틀과 부조리함에 맞서며 더 나은 세상을 만들기 위해 쉼 없이 달려왔다. 여섯 번째 미니 앨범 ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’은 ‘HARMONY’ 시리즈의 마지막 여정으로, 필수불가결한 존재인 물을 통해 조화로운 세계를 완성하는 모습을 그려냈다. \n\n앨범명 ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’은 조화로운 세상을 위해 모든 것을 바치는 피원하모니의 의지를 담았다. 타이틀곡 ‘JUMP’는 힙합 베이스의 사운드로 진행되는 얼터너티브 팝 장르의 댄스곡이다. 고민하고 망설이기보다는 지금 이 감정을 즐기며 함께 더 높이 ‘JUMP’하며 올라가자는 피원하모니의 외침이 자유롭고 역동적인 퍼포먼스로 담겼다. \n\n타이틀곡 ‘JUMP’ 외에도 피아노 리프가 인상적인 힙합곡 ‘Love Me For Me’, 힙합 느낌의 신스 사운드와 808베이스 리프 구성이 매력적인 ‘New Classic’, 몽환적인 신스 사운드에 다채로운 보컬이 조화를 이루는 ‘More Than Words’, 팝 댄스곡 ‘Heartbeat Drum’, 슬로우 템포의 R&B 장르의 ‘I Am You’까지 총 여섯 곡이 수록되었다. \n \n‘HARMONY’ 시리즈의 마지막, 미니 6집으로 비로소 완벽한 세상을 완성한 피원하모니. 이번 앨범은 피원하모니 또한 물처럼 필수불가결한 그룹임을 깨닫게 해줄 완성도 높은 앨범이 될 것이다.\n\nFrom the ‘DISHARMONY’ trilogy to the ‘HARMONY’ series, P1Harmony has been working tirelessly to create a better world by confronting frames and absurdities that define us. The 6th Mini Album, ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’ is the final page of the ‘HARMONY’ series, depicting the completion of the harmonious world through water, which is an indispensable element\n\nThe album title ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’ reflects P1Harmony’s spirit of dedicating everything to the harmonious world. The title song ‘JUMP’ is a dance music of alternative pop genre with hip-hop based sound. A free and dynamic performance captures P1Harmony’s message to “JUMP” higher together while enjoying the feelings at the moment rather than worrying and hesitating.\n\nIn addition to the title track, ‘JUMP’, a total of six tracks are included in this album: a hip-hop track with an impressive piano riff, ‘Love Me For Me,’ ‘New Classic’ featuring a hip-hop-like synth sound and 808 bass riff, ‘More Than Words,’ with a dreamy synth sound and colorful vocals, a pop dance song, ‘Heartbeat Drum,’ and ‘I Am You,’ a slow-tempo R&B song.\n \nThe last in the 'HARMONY' series, P1Harmony has completed the perfect world with the 6th Mini Album. This album will be a high quality album that will make you realize that P1Harmony is also an indispensable group like water.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_official\n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_members\n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official\n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TIKTOK : https://www.tiktok.com/@p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #6th_Mini_Album #HARMONY #ALLIN #JUMP","title":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) – ‘JUMP’ MV","duration":193,"channel_id":"UCZECMCJJJE47ei170XCXgdA","author":"FNCEnt","date":"20230608","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hc1OjFxv-M","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Hc1OjFxv-M/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":20533378}}

{"description":"Jimmy Butler has really shined in the postseason, leading Nick Wright to tell Colin Cowherd that underestimating him and the Miami Heat in these NBA Playoffs has been a serious mistake. He points to Butler's stats, and explains why he's one of the top postseason players in the league. Plus, rumors are swirling that LeBron James is being recruited to the Dallas Mavericks by none other than Kyrie Irving, and in response, the Los Angeles Lakers released a statement that they have no intention of bringing on Kyrie to their roster... Nick and Colin share their thoughts on this report, and Nick tells Colin why he believes both players will remain right where they are.\n\n#TheHerd #NBA #MiamiHeat\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb \n \n►Watch the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/LatestOnTheHerd \n\n▶The Carton Show's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED \n►Speak’s YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from THE HERD: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFoxSports \nLike THE HERD on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFacebook \nFollow THE HERD on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDTwitter \nFollow THE HERD on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDInstagram \n\nFollow Colin Cowherd on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ColinCowherdTwitter \n \nAbout The Herd with Colin Cowherd:\nThe Herd with Colin Cowherd is a three-hour sports television and radio show on FS1 and iHeartRadio.
