Her husband passed many years ago, and after maintaining their 50-acre ranch property, she decided to downsize and live simply in Austin, Texas. She and her husband used to be sailors, so the galley kitchen feels right at home! The bedroom has a rustic feel with a cedar accent wall, turquoise decor, and a large bed centered in the middle. With ceilings stretching over thirteen feet high, the entire tiny home feels beyond the 399sq ft it is. There's an exterior living space that welcomes neighbors and friends to gather by the wood-burning fireplace while the sun sets just over her prominent balcony.\n\nShot by: @theirhappytrails\nEdited by: @theirhappytrails\n\n______________________________BONUS CONTENT_____________________________________\nNature's Head Toilet With Bonuses - http://bit.ly/NaturesHeadTHT\nTiny House & Skoolie Build Gear - https://skooliecentral.com/gear/\nTiny Home Tours Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Tinyhome.tours/\nTiny Home Tours Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/tinyhometours/\nLife On The Road Newsletter - http://eepurl.com/gAyDP5\nWant To See More Skoolie Videos? - https://skooliecentral.com/\nNeed Something On Amazon?

With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ‚ñ∫https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ‚ñ∫https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"I Jinxed It With My Overconfidence","duration":1475,"channel_id":"UCp0rRUsMDlJ1meYAQ6_37Dw","author":"Millennial Farmer","date":"20220812","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgMC7xsbH5k","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/TgMC7xsbH5k/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":379859}}

{"description":"yEAAHHH. So, after wasting 20 bucks on Clawee and other virtual claw machine apps, basically I went nuts and bought an ACTUAL claw machine. It's currently hanging out in my art room and I'm hoping to eventually fill it with cool prizes like squishies, plushies and other cute items that are fun to customize. However, there is oneeeee little problem. This claw machine is NOT my style at all. SOOO. I am going to spend a couple weeks customizing the claw machine itself first.
