Christine recently got married and gushed over her wedding telling Access Hollywood it was \"a dream come true.\" \"I never expected like a soulmate or true love really like that, just because I hadn't known what it was like. When I met David, I remember the moment specifically where I fell in love with him,\" she said. Christine also teased what it was like when her new husband, David Woolley, met her ex-husband, Kody Brown. Christine isn't the only one starting fresh, Janelle is no longer with Kody and she told Access when she first thought about leaving her ex. The two ladies also gave their honest opinion on Kody's marriage to Robyn Brown.

{"description":"We got one of the biggest names in streaming joining us today, Kai Cenat (@KaiCenat )! Kai shares the story of how he became one of the biggest voices in such a new space by just being himself and developing a relationship with his massive following. But this success didn't come easy, Kai spent years prioritizing his dreams of being an entertainer and content creator over partying and doing what everyone else was doing and now at the age of only 21 has already bought his mother a house and is still young enough to take his life in any direction imaginable.

Sea you there.\n#Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - Only in theaters December 22.\n\nDirector James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa‚Äîalong with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman‚Äîreturn in the sequel to the highest-grossing DC film of all time: ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom.‚Äù\n\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father‚Äôs death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman‚Äôs family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.\n\nAll returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman‚Äôs half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother‚Äôs reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis‚Äô Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father‚Äôs death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.\n\nDirected by Wan, ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom‚Äù is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.\n\nThe screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa‚Äôa Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. \n\nJoining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (‚ÄúThe Conjuring 2‚Äù), production designer Bill Brzeski (‚ÄúJumanji: The Next Level‚Äù), editor Kirk Morri (‚ÄúFurious 7‚Äù), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (‚ÄúMalignant‚Äù). Visual effects supervisor Nick Davis (‚ÄúThe Clash of the Titans‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight‚Äù) and costume designer Richard Sale (‚ÄúDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,‚Äù ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù) also join.\n\nWarner Bros.

Construction workers will help you build the house you want.\n\nCustomers are coming! Negotiate and try to get the best offer. Try to deal with reputable clients. When the rent day comes, you have to go to the houses and collect the rent money from the tenants, but some customers may not pay the rent. However, if you have a bank account, the rent money will be deposited into your account. Don't forget to check regularly.

{"description":"This is the second fully integrated full stack test flight of Starship and the mighty Super Heavy booster, the largest and most most powerful rocket to ever fly. It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. \n\nThe goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-2 in April 20th which didn't make it to stage separation while also hoping the improvements to the launch pad hold up better than the previous attempt. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter near Hawaii about 90 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, nearly completing an orbit of the Earth. This would allow the teams to test the reentry profile and heat shields for the first time from orbital velocities. \n\nWant more information?

Ahead of the launch, SpaceX will close the road, evacuate the village and surrounding area, and clear the potential blast radius. \n\nBooster 9 will attempt a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while Ship 25 will attempt to fly around the earth before performing a reentry and hard splashdown in the Hawaiian area. \n\nWindow Opens: November 18th at 7AM CST (13:00 UTC)\nWindow Closes: November 18th at 7:20AM CST (13:20 UTC)\n\nMission: Starship's second fully integrated test flight \nVehicles: Booster 9 and Ship 25\nRecovery: No recovery.
