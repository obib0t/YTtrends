The Three-Way Knockouts are also back. This time, however, artists will select their own songs to perform.\n\nOnce the Live Performance Shows begin, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast. This time, the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists.

{"description":"Bobby Carter | December 18, 2023\nScarface's Tiny Desk concert radiates with his decadeslong passion as an emcee and producer. There's calculated intent behind every word and note of this 30-minute set and I learned that his love for golf also runs deep during our initial meeting. He was playing a round and had difficulty dividing his attention between the plan and the course. Three days before the show, amid rehearsals, I got a call from Facemob asking, \"What if I brought Mike Dean?\" My expectations were already high, but that final addition set the stage for something special.\n\nMike Dean provided unmatched authenticity, and their shared stories added sentimental value to this performance. After all, his signature keys and synths can be heard on most of Scarface's classics and countless Rap-A-Lot records. Here, we get a rare glimpse of Scarface the conductor, bouncing through multiple eras of his catalog including \"On My Block,\" \"Mary Jane\" and the bone-chilling \"I Seen a Man Die.\"\n\nScarface, along with Rakim, was recently awarded the inaugural Hip-Hop Grandmaster Award from the newly launched Paid in Full Foundation, which includes a sizable financial prize and healthcare. No matter how the never-ending hip-hop greats debate is sliced, the rapper's place is cemented as one of the most influential storytellers in the culture and his Tiny Desk is proof.\n\nSET LIST\n\"On My Block\"\n\"Mary Jane\"\n\"Smile\"\n\"I Seen a Man Die\"\n\"F**k Faces\"\n\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nScarface: lead vocals, guitar\nMike Dean: keys\nSteven \"Spud\" Howard: vocals\nTakai \"Cookie\" Hicks: vocals \nPeigh Jones: vocals, guitar \nCorey \"FunkaFingers\" Stoot: guitar \nJosh Henderson: keys\nJason \"The Bishop\" Allen: keys\nSavar Martin: drums \nAnthony \"Antboogie\" Nicholson: bass, musical direction \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Maia Stern\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, AlantÃ© Serene, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Ted Mebane\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Kara Frame, Hazel Cills\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #scarface","title":"Scarface: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1887,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20231218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajNYTJcF6rE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ajNYTJcF6rE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":928045}}

{"description":"Get tickets now: https://www.thechosenriseup.com/\n\n\"Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" That was the theme of Season 3. Jesus said this to a crowd of thousands before also saying it to Simon while they stood on water. Season 4? Jesus is weary and heavy-laden, and He needs rest.\n\nWe're getting closer and closer to Jerusalem, to what we know is coming. Jesus is getting increasingly frustrated, and yes, sad. Not because he's getting closer to death, but because of the reasons He must die. From his faith's religious leaders, to the holy city of Jerusalem, to his own friends and followers, people are not understanding his mission. To that end, He must allow painful things, and even set in motion certain confusing or bittersweet events, to accelerate the outcomes that will lead to Holy Week. \n\nSeason 4 marks the midpoint of the most famous and influential story in human history. It will be painful, and it will be joyous. It will be bittersweet. But by all measures, Season 4 will also be our best.\n\n- Dallas Jenkins, Creator of The Chosen","title":"The Chosen: Season 4 Official Trailer","duration":150,"channel_id":"UCBXOFnNTULFaAnj24PAeblg","author":"The Chosen","date":"20231218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wisX-CEjoxc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/wisX-CEjoxc/hqdefault.webp?v=657c826e","content":{"View count":931017}}

{"description":"Olivia Rodrigo - pretty isnât pretty | Vevo Official Live Performance \n\nOnly superlatives come to mind when trying to sum up Olivia Rodrigoâs last few years. Her incredibly impactful debut ballad âdrivers licenseâ goes hand in hand with words such as âmostâ and âbestâ: most streams on Spotify in a single day and week, Top 100 most-streamed songs on the platform, the Best Pop Solo Performance award at that yearâs GRAMMYs. That the teen sensation could follow the âdrivers licenseâ craze with âgood 4 u,â âdeja vu,â and ultimately her debut album âSOURâ - all now equally beloved - was the first sign that the pop world had a rarified capital S Superstar on its hands. You can forget about that dreaded sophomore slump too. Thanks in part to her trusty producer sidekick Dan Nigro, âGUTSâ elevates all the ingredients that really popped in âSOUR,â the 90s slacker rock guitar arrangements and riffs, the theater-kid earnestness, the talkative asides. Thereâs one key thematic difference. âLots of the new songs are about growing up rather than breakups,â Olivia proudly stated recently. When we linked up with her at the Million Dollar Theater in LA, not only had her wattage grown brighter, her command of the stage and camera were somehow even stronger than before. Speaking of growing up, \"pretty isn't pretty\" takes aim the not-so-nice social pressures one faces as the spotlight grows brighter, especially women. Another gut punch delivered on a platter of angsty pop-rock perfection. \n\nListen to GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS\nShop GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/store\n\nFollow Olivia Rodrigo:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oliviarodrigo\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oliviarodrigo\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OliviaRodrigoOfficial\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@livbedumb\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/livieshq\n\nVevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\nDirector: Skyler Brown\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nDirector, Line Production: Yanina Molina\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nLine Producer, Contrast Films: Cole Brian\nSenior Producer, Editorial: Ronni Leverich\nAssociate Producer: Lola Gatti\nAssociate Producer, Contrast Films: Sacha Noelle\nDirector of Photography: Tehillah De Castro\nProduction Designer: Helen Morales\nHead of Design: Sydney Emery\nDirector of Post Production: Michael Coleman\nProject Manager: Dominic Siri\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nDirector, Talent: Gabby Prisciandaro\nHead of Artist/Label Relations & Digital Marketing: David McTiernan\n\nHayley Brownell â Drums\nCamila Mora - Keys\nMoa Munoz â Bass\nEmily Rosenfield â Guitar\nDaisy Spencer â Guitar\n \nAleen Keshishian - Lighthouse Management + Media\nZack Morgenroth - Lighthouse Management + Media\nJames Thompson - Lighthouse Management + Media\n \nStacy Jones â Musical Director\nMax Mitchell â Musical Director\nValerie Morehouse-wilde â Vocal Coach\nMelissa Garcia â Movement\n \nMarty Hom â Tour Director \nBret Chin-quan â Tour / Production Manager\nElisa Gonzalez â Production Coordinator\nBrian Pomp â Audio Engineer\nSeamus Fenton â Audio Engineer\nPaul Hager â Broadcast Mixer\nCraig Frank â Playback \nLuis Munoz â Backline Tech\nRyan Gore â Backline Tech\nMaurizio â Backline Tech\nChristian Pagliarulo - Runner\n \n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Cole Ewing\n1st AC: Michael Lemnitze\n2nd AC: Jenny Roh\nLoader: Chastin Noblett\n\nA1: Casey Graham\nA2: Maja Sazdic\n\nGaffer: Jihan \"Jay\" Casquejo\nBest Boy Electric: Peter Murphy\nSLT/Driver: Paul Kane\nSLT: Ben Bowen\nSLT: Mauricio Aguilar\nSLT: Diego Castellanos\nKey Grip: Kyle Sorvig\nBest Boy Grip: Connor Colby \nGrip: Hannah Rydberg\nGrip: Matt Seest\nGrip: Mason McLaury\nGrip: Nick Zajic\n\nGrip: Jacob Senn\nLCP: Ryan Jacob Morgan\n\nArt Director: Nicholas Kerr\nSet Decorator: Katie Balun\nLead Person: Ian Buckley \nArt Department Coordinator: Matthew Toth\nSet Dresser: Christopher \"Drew\" Wall\nSet Dresser: Jonathan \"Jrod\" Rodriguez\nSet Dresser: Jessen T.

Sadot's Super News ð®ð¥\"\n\nð Durag Nation, brace yourselves for a major update on the Insomniac Games hack, arguably the worst leak in gaming history. Skip the intros - we're diving straight into this critical situation. If you value this kind of urgent gaming news, smash that like button or hit dislike as you see fit. Let's get into it. ð®ð\n\nð¹ 'Insomniac Games Under Siege': First, a shoutout to the team at Insomniac, who are facing a tough time with both their hard work being compromised and personal employee information leaked. This isn't just about the games; it's about real people behind them whose lives are at risk. ð¨ð¥\n\nð¹ 'Massive Scale of the Leak': The hackers demanded a ransom and even hosted an auction for the stolen data. After a week, they released most of what they had - over 1 million files, totaling 1.6 terabytes. This includes everything from employee passports to the licensing agreement between Marvel Games and Insomniac. ðð\n\nð¹ 'Targeted Attack on Insomniac and Sony': The hackers' intention was purely monetary, choosing Insomniac and Sony as they believed gaming companies would be easy targets. They accessed the network in under 30 minutes, and the fallout is catastrophic. ð°ð¹ï¸\n\nð¹ 'Impact on Insomniacâs Future Plans': Every plan Insomniac had for the next decade is now exposed, including budgets, release years, and identities of upcoming games. 'Marvelâs Wolverine' has been particularly hit hard, with gameplay, cutscenes, and the entire story leaked. ðð®\n\nð¹ 'Comparisons to GTA 6 Leak': While GTA 6 suffered a leak of early test footage, the scale of Insomniac's breach is unparalleled. This could potentially lead to a major reshuffle of 'Marvelâs Wolverine', especially its storyline. ð­ð\n\nð¹ 'Protecting Employees and Bolstering Security': The primary focus now is ensuring the safety of affected employees and significantly upgrading Sony's security to prevent future incidents. This leak will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the gaming industry. ðð¡ï¸\n\nYou would have to mute everything related to Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, Venom, The X-Men, and Wolverine to avoid spoilers\n\n#wolverineps5 #wolverine #MarvelsWolverine #InsomniacGames #GamingNews #PlayStation5 #SpiderMan2 #marvel","title":"It's Over...RIP Marvel's Wolverine","duration":273,"channel_id":"UCDZFQQgFuXiVnjyeAs9Ylkg","author":"Sadot The Gamer","date":"20231219","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oL96ARo2cQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1oL96ARo2cQ/hqdefault.jpg?v=6581cf51","content":{"View count":152095}}

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! This week weâre taking a 52-hour Amtrak sleeper train across the country! So, I've fallen over to the \"overnight sleeper train\" side of youtube - and I am HOOKED, people. And after watching hours and hours of train content, I decided - it was time to try my own hand at it. So we took the California Zephyr train, which travels from San Francisco to Chicago (and also the other direction as well) - across 7 states and over 2,400 miles!! We experienced everything from delays to endless sauce packets to MANY rock sightings. Would you try traveling across the US by train? And where do you think we should we go next? Or better yet, how should we get there?\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com \n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw \nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig \n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nExecutive Producers: Safiya Nygaard & Tyler Williams\nHead of Production: Carey Fiock\nProduction Manager / Producer: Melissa Douglas\nJunior Associate Producer: Ishara Mathews\nProduction Assistant: Aayanah McCreary\nContent Promotions & Video Packaging Manager: Alaina Simmons\nShort Form Producer: Myia Lambe\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Mandy Padgett\nAssistant Editor: Hailey Cox\nGraphic Designer: Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n1:50 All Aboard The California Zephyr!\n3:41 Our Room Tour\n5:27 A Tour Of The Entire Train!\n8:06 Day 1: Sacramento & Lunch\n10:56 Nevada & Dinner\n12:56 Setting Up Our Room for Sleeping\n14:39 Day 2: Mooning (?!) & Colorado\n17:07 Conquering The Shower \n18:53 The Good, The Bad, & Theâ¦Cows?\n21:11 The Moffat Tunnel (& The History of the Zephyr)\n23:15 Denver & Drinks\n25:28 Day 3: Omaha & Breakfast\n27:09 Our Final Destination: Chicago! \n29:28 Outro\n\n#train #travel #vlog","title":"I Took A 52-Hour Sleeper Train From San Francisco To Chicago","duration":1783,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20231218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbooXnvsE8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ajbooXnvsE8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1410263}}

{"description":"The crew is back at @midamericaoutdoors for Travis Pastrana's final progression session along side Banks Hovey. As Travis awaits a full knee replacement in the coming days, he has decided to check one last item off his bucket list. Travis' goal is to back flip onto an elevated platform, do a nose bonk, then front flip out of the nose bonk back to his wheels. Banks plans to jump onto the platform, wheelie across, and backflip off. Both of these tricks have never been attempted, so come along for the ride as Nate Wessel and Hubert Rowland help Travis and Banks work through multiple ramp variations, distance measurements, platform angles, and injuries in an attempt to reach their goals.\n\nFollow Us:\nChannel 199 IG: https://www.instagram.com/channel199_/\nTravis IG: https://www.instagram.com/travispastrana/\nBRCC IG: https://www.instagram.com/blackriflecoffee/\nBRCC Motorsports IG: https://www.instagram.com/brcc_motorsports/\n\nShop Travis/BRCC: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/pages/travis-pastrana","title":"PASTRANAâS FINAL SEND","duration":1006,"channel_id":"UCeikp7aPCip7YW9tCA3ilBg","author":"Channel 199","date":"20231217","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlv50fh7m_4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qlv50fh7m_4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1203885}}

{"description":"Paddy Pimblett's triumph over Tony Ferguson at UFC 296 unfolded as a captivating 15-minute spectacle, culminating in a decisive unanimous decision victory. Despite initial aspirations for an early finish, Pimblett's performance demonstrated a profound level of control and skill throughout the bout, leaving an indelible mark on the T-Mobile Arena. #UFC296 #tonyferguson #paddypimblett \n\nHailing from Liverpool, Pimblett showcased his striking prowess in the first round, where Ferguson resiliently weathered a barrage of attacks.

Now all we need is some sails and we are ready to get wet.Â Â \n\nPlus, we reveal the completed installation of what has no doubt been the most debated piece of equipment of this entire boat building saga.\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I think building a new boat would be this much work.Â  And weâre not even the ones doing the labor.Â \n\nOur days and nights are filled to the brim with decisions to be made, parts to be purchased and logistics to be planned (oh how I have NOT missed maritime bureaucracy).Â  The closer handover day gets, the more complicated the logistics seem to get.Â  Boat insurance for SE Asia looks expensive and potentially difficult to obtain.Â  Weâre still searching for the port of least resistance to check into the Philippines and sailing out of China, well that is a whole other kettle of fish.Â \n\nSo many adventures ahead with so many variables to plan for.Â  We have gained a boat load of knowledge over the past 2 years (much more than expected) and we still have soooo much more to learn.Â  We are fortunate HH Catamarans has been so open to letting us roam free in the yard, film without abandon and ask 1001 questions.Â \n\nThank you so much for being a part of this untethered journey with us. Â Itâs been a rollercoaster of a year, and I donât expect 2024 will be anything less.Â  So, rest up, have the most wonderful holiday break and we will see you in the new year!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWEâRE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWeâve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and weâre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Building a New Catamaran\n01:47 Buying a Dishwasher for a Sailboat\n04:09 Dishwasher Install on a Catamaran\n08:05 Our Electric Jet Tender\n11:14 Sea Trials of the ZeroJet OC Tender\n17:35 Incredible Chinese Seafood Restaurant \n19:55 China Package Delivery\n20:41 Installing the Mast on a Sailboat\n23:14 Interior and Cushion Designs\n24:35 Good End to an Untethered Year\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\nÂ© Gone With the Wynns 2023","title":"Biggest Argument Settled!

This time last year we definitively ranked pop culture and meme moments from 2022 and I had a few of you ask for a 2023 version so here we are. Also thanks to everyone who has been sending stuff in over the past few weeks, really appreciate it :))  also x2 sorry if i sound quieter than usual i had the flu when i was recording this go easy on meeee thank u LOL and final also... (sorry) you prob noticed i had to try a different set up for filming this one, because this was a longer list and the tier size was going to change a lot i realized the easiest way to keep as much of it in view as possible was to ditch the green screen for this one so hope you dont mind!!!  \n\nOk SO after consulting you guys (and myself lol) i widdled down all the pop culture moments and memes that happened this year whether they were tik tok trends, twitter moments, celebrity pop culture stuff or other noteworthy events for us to rank today! We're talking the Josh Hutcherson whistle meme, Harry Styles going bald, Taylor Swift enjoying seemingly... ranch?

{"description":"In the opening round of the 2023 PNC Championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods carded a combined 8-under 64.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PNC Championship is held for the 26th time this week as the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hosts 20 two-player teams featuring a PGA TOUR, Champions Tour or LPGA player and one of their family members. After Tiger Woods made his return to action at the Hero World Challenge for the first time since withdrawing at the Masters, heâll once again be back to tee it up at the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie. The duo was tied for second a year ago after the first round, but stalled on Sunday and ended up tied for eighth. Justin Thomas returns this year to play alongside his father, Mike.  Justin Thomas finished third at the Hero World Challenge two weeks ago and will be feeling confident about taking his second PNC Championship title, as the Thomases won here in 2020. Defending champions Vijay Singh and his son Qass are looking to recreate their magic from 2022. Last year was their 16th time teeing it up together at this event, and they finally broke through for a win, becoming the first pair to shoot two sub-60 rounds at the event. Other pairings to look out for are Nelly Korda and her father Petr, Matt Kuchar and his elder son Cameron, and Bernhard Langer and his son Jason.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Tiger and Charlie Woods shoot 8-under 64 | Round 1 | PNC Championship | 2023","duration":492,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20231216","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXHgVesf1xE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cXHgVesf1xE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":710644}}

{"description":"Olivia Rodrigo - get him back! | Vevo Official Live Performance\n\nOnly superlatives come to mind when trying to sum up Olivia Rodrigoâs last few years. Her incredibly impactful debut ballad âdrivers licenseâ goes hand in hand with words such as âmostâ and âbestâ: most streams on Spotify in a single day and week, Top 100 most-streamed songs on the platform, the Best Pop Solo Performance award at that yearâs GRAMMYs. That the teen sensation could follow the âdrivers licenseâ craze with âgood 4 u,â âdeja vu,â and ultimately her debut album âSOURâ - all now equally beloved - was the first sign that the pop world had a rarified capital S Superstar on its hands. You can forget about that dreaded sophomore slump too. Thanks in part to her trusty producer sidekick Dan Nigro, âGUTSâ elevates all the ingredients that really popped in âSOUR,â the 90s slacker rock guitar arrangements and riffs, the theater-kid earnestness, the talkative asides. Thereâs one key thematic difference. âLots of the new songs are about growing up rather than breakups,â Olivia proudly stated recently. When we linked up with her at the Million Dollar Theater in LA, not only had her wattage grown brighter, her command of the stage and camera were somehow even stronger than before. The chosen acoustic slant of âget him back!â doesnât take away from its puckish edge. In fact, it feels like youâve crashed the band's rehearsal sesh, where youâre happily stomping and clapping along in the corner while they make a some magic. \n\nListen to âget him back!â on GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS\n\nShop GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/store\n\nFollow Olivia Rodrigo:\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/oliviarodrigo/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oliviarodrigo\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OliviaRodrigoOfficial/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@livbedumb\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/livieshq\n\nVevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\nDirector: Skyler Brown\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nDirector, Line Production: Yanina Molina\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nLine Producer, Contrast Films: Cole Brian\nSenior Producer, Editorial: Ronni Leverich\nAssociate Producer: Lola Gatti\nAssociate Producer, Contrast Films: Sacha Noelle\nDirector of Photography: Tehillah De Castro\nProduction Designer: Helen Morales\nHead of Design: Sydney Emery\nDirector of Post Production: Michael Coleman\nProject Manager: Dominic Siri\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nDirector, Talent: Gabby Prisciandaro\nHead of Artist/Label Relations & Digital Marketing: David McTiernan\n\nHayley Brownell â Drums\nCamila Mora - Keys\nMoa Munoz â Bass\nEmily Rosenfield â Guitar\nDaisy Spencer â Guitar\n \nAleen Keshishian - Lighthouse Management + Media\nZack Morgenroth - Lighthouse Management + Media\nJames Thompson - Lighthouse Management + Media\n \nStacy Jones â Musical Director\nMax Mitchell â Musical Director\nValerie Morehouse-wilde â Vocal Coach\nMelissa Garcia â Movement\n \nMarty Hom â Tour Director \nBret Chin-quan â Tour / Production Manager\nElisa Gonzalez â Production Coordinator\nBrian Pomp â Audio Engineer\nSeamus Fenton â Audio Engineer\nPaul Hager â Broadcast Mixer\nCraig Frank â Playback \nLuis Munoz â Backline Tech\nRyan Gore â Backline Tech\nMaurizio â Backline Tech\nChristian Pagliarulo - Runner\n \n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Cole Ewing\n1st AC: Michael Lemnitze\n2nd AC: Jenny Roh\nLoader: Chastin Noblett\n\nA1: Casey Graham\nA2: Maja Sazdic\n\nGaffer: Jihan \"Jay\" Casquejo\nBest Boy Electric: Peter Murphy\nSLT/Driver: Paul Kane\nSLT: Ben Bowen\nSLT: Mauricio Aguilar\nSLT: Diego Castellanos\nKey Grip: Kyle Sorvig\nBest Boy Grip: Connor Colby \nGrip: Hannah Rydberg\nGrip: Matt Seest\nGrip: Mason McLaury\nGrip: Nick Zajic\n\nGrip: Jacob Senn\nLCP: Ryan Jacob Morgan\n\nArt Director: Nicholas Kerr\nSet Decorator: Katie Balun\nLead Person: Ian Buckley \nArt Department Coordinator: Matthew Toth\nSet Dresser: Christopher \"Drew\" Wall\nSet Dresser: Jonathan \"Jrod\" Rodriguez\nSet Dresser: Jessen T.

{"description":"Kung Fu Panda 4 - In Theaters March 8\n\nThis spring, for the first time in almost a decade, comedy icon Jack Black returns to his role as Po, the worldâs most unlikely kung fu master, with a hilarious, butt-kicking new chapter in DreamWorks Animationâs beloved action-comedy franchise: Kung Fu Panda 4. \n\nAfter three death-defying adventures defeating world-class villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills, Po, the Dragon Warrior (Golden Globe nominee Jack Black), is called upon by destiny to â¦ give it a rest already. More specifically, heâs tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace.\n\nThat poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. \n\nEven worse, thereâs been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (OscarÂ® winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Poâs Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. \n\nSo, Poâs going to need some help. He finds it (kinda?) in the form of crafty, quick-witted thief Zhen (Golden Globe winner Awkwafina), a corsac fox who really gets under Poâs fur but whose skills will prove invaluable. In their quest to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleonâs reptilian claws, this comedic odd-couple duo will have to work together. In the process, Po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places. \n\nThe film features the voice talent of returning stars Academy AwardÂ® winner Dustin Hoffman as Kung Fu master, Shifu; James Hong (Everything Everywhere All at Once) as Poâs adoptive father, Mr. Ping; Academy AwardÂ® nominee Bryan Cranston as Poâs birth father, Li, and Emmy Award nominee Ian McShane as Tai Lung, Shifuâs former student and arch-nemesis. OscarÂ® winner Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All at Once) joins the ensemble as a new character, Han, the leader of the Den of Thieves. \n \nKung Fu Panda 4 is directed by Mike Mitchell (DreamWorks Animationâs Trolls, Shrek Forever After) and produced by Rebecca Huntley (DreamWorks Animationâs The Bad Guys). The filmâs co-director is Stephanie Ma Stine (She-Ra and the Princesses of Power). In 2008, the Academy AwardÂ®-nominated 2008 inaugural chapter, Kung Fu Panda, became DreamWorks Animationâs highest-grossing original animated film and launched a franchise that has earned more than $1.8 billion at the global box-office.\n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/kungfupanda \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kungfupanda \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.kungfupanda.com\n#KungFuPanda","title":"KUNG FU PANDA 4 | Official Trailer","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_inKs4eeHiI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_inKs4eeHiI/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":17246905}}
