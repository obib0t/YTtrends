{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! a bit of an experimental video here, but i hope you guys like it... \n\nHave you ever wondered why you always get lost in IKEA? Or why you can't leave Sephora without a hand full of lipstick swatches? Or why you just love hanging out at Target? I was curious... so I decided to do some research on how different retail stores manipulate you into spending more time at their stores, interacting with their products more, and therefore, spending more of you hard earned cash at their shops. We explored different tactics that Ikea, Target, Sephora, and Ulta use to lure customers in & keep them there until they make a purchase! This is the first of a 3-part series we're gonna be working on throughout the year!\n\nA big thank you to Jen Clinehens for helping us out with this video; make sure to check out her YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/GrowLiketheGreatest\n\nMake sure to check out The Food Theorists' video on Grocery store manipulation here!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqviBPG2uPE\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/‚Äã\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nWRITTEN by\nRachel Faulkner\nSafiya Nygaard\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDayana Espinoza\nJarvis Rooker\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nOther sources:\nRemus, Emily. ‚ÄúDisruptive Shopping: Women, Space, and Capitalism.‚Äù The American Historian, The Organization of American Historians\nSegran, Elizabeth. ‚ÄúDepartment Stores Were the Original Retail Startups.

{"description":"New signing Gabriel Jesus scored 90 seconds into his non-competitive debut to trigger an extraordinary turnaround in Germany.\n\n1. FC Nurnberg, who play in the second tier of German football, raced to a 2-0 half-time lead, before we emerged as a different proposition after the break.\n\nJesus had to sit and watch from the bench for the opening half, alongside other new arrival Marquinhos, with Matt Turner the only one of our four summer signings named in the starting XI.\n\nBut once Jesus was unleashed, he marked the occasion with a wonderful brace, and had a say in both of the own goals too.\n\nThe other goal came from the boot of Mohamed Elneny, and what a screamer it was, flying in from long range.\n\nMikel Arteta opted for a fairly young starting lineup, including 17-year-old defender Reuell Walters, one of several youngsters out with the squad at our training camp in Germany.\n\nHe started in the centre of defence alongside Pablo Mari, and showed his speed early on to get back and dispossess Kwadwo Duah. Christoph Daferner had already headed wide when well placed in a bright opening for the home side.\n\nIt look 15 minutes for us to fashion our first effort on goal. Emile Smith Rowe‚Äôs right-footed curler was goalbound until Christian Mathenia in the hosts‚Äô goal turned it away for a corner.\n\nMidway through the half though we fell behind, when Johannes Geis struck powerfully from outside the area, in off the crossbar. There was plenty of pace and movement on the shot, deceiving Turner in the Gunners goal.\n\nJust five minutes later Duah doubled the advantage, cracking home across Turner inside the far post after we lost possession cheaply.\n\nWe had to regroup. Ainsley Maitland-Niles flashed a cross-shot just wide while Reiss Nelson saw an effort deflected behind for a corner.\n\nBut we failed to really get going in the opening half, and went in two goals down at the break.\n\nJesus was brought on at the interval, along with three other subs. And with virtually his first touch in an Arsenal shirt, he fired us back into the game.\n\nHe picked up possession outside the area, advanced and swapped passes with Eddie Nketiah, before smashing home at the near post. What an introduction to life as a Gunner.\n\nThe tone of the game had changed and moments later he strode into the box again before being tackled this time.\n\nOne of the other half-time replacements, Mohamed Elneny, brought us level with an absolute thunderbolt from fully 25 yards.\n\nInside an hour we were ahead. After another excellent move, a deep cross was destined for Jesus‚Äôs head, only for Christopher Schindler to stretch out a boot and turn the ball past his own keeper.\n\nIt was a stunning 12-minute turnaround from Arteta‚Äôs men.\n\nWe weren‚Äôt finished there though. Just after the hour mark, Nketiah‚Äôs shot cannoned back off the cross bar, hit Nurnberg defender Tim Handwerker and trickled over his own goal-line under pressure from Jesus.\n\nMore subs followed for the last 20 minutes, with Folarin Balogun, Charlie Patino, Salah Oulad M‚Äôhand, Arthur Okonkwo and new arrival Marquinhos all coming on.\n\nNurnberg substitute Lukas Schleimer momentarily pulled it back to a single goal deficit, but Jesus soon claimed his second of the afternoon, from a Gabriel Martinelli cross, to make it 5-3.\n\nIt was a wonderful, instinctive finish from our new boy to beat the keeper from close range.\n\nBy now we were in control, and able to enjoy the denouement to a week of hard work and preparation at the adidas HQ in Germany. And if this is a glimpse of what‚Äôs to come from Jesus in particular, then the start of the season can‚Äôt come soon enough.\n\n#jesus #elneny #turner\n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Nikita Parris, Tobin Heath, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White, Thomas Partey and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"According to Brian Windhorst, LeBron James is more interested in the Lakers getting Kyrie Irving than the organization itself and that the King might use his looming contract extension to push LA to jump for the point guard. The Lakers are also reportedly trying to pull in the San Antonio Spurs for a three-team deal in order to make the numbers work. Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe react to the report and discuss what this shows about LeBron.\n\n#Undisputed #NBA #LeBronJames\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n‚ñ∂First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n‚ñ∂The Herd with Colin Cowherd‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n‚ñ∂Speak for Yourself‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF\n‚ñ∫FOX Bet Live‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n‚ñ∫Club Shay Shay‚Äôs YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n‚ñ∫The Skip Bayless Show YouTube Channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n‚ñ∂Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE\n‚ñ∫What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube Channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\nFollow UNDISPUTED on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@undisputedonfs1?lang=en\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\nFollow Jenny Taft on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/JennyTaftTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.

{"description":"The 2023 Acura Integra Elite A-Spec MT (~$46,280 in Canada as specced, $ in the US) is finally back after a long 15 year wait. To blend sportiness with comfortability, Acura have included a limited slip differential and adaptive dampers to compliment their 1.5L turbo four cylinder. However, for the price this trim commands, it‚Äôs put into some competitive territory among FWD cars. It also has to compete with its more affordable younger brother, the Civic SI - which comes very well specced here in Canada. Thomas and James spend some time with the new Integra to see how it stands out among the crowd, and if it is worth the jump up from the delightful Civic. We hope you enjoy the episode!

Also use them to take the oil out\nGrip firmly. Dropping anything into hot oil is very bad news\nFlip them after a coupe minutes \nmake sure they get to at least 165 degrees F \nIf you don't own a food thermometer this is your sign to buy one today \nThey are inexpensive and it will change your relationship with cooking because \nyou'll know for sure when something is cooked and you won't have to overcook it \nYou're welcome, thank me in the comments. \n\nAlso have a terrific day.

{"description":"https://stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html\nhttps://curesarcoma.org/donate/\nhttps://giving.mskcc.org\n\n\nI didn't remember much on how I grew to love his content, but I remember knowing him through my brother. A few days before the Mr. Beast duel, I remember him asking me who would win. Me knowing Dream more than Techno, I had chosen the former, and my brother the latter. After that, I watched Techno's analysis of the duel, and his methods of telling a story in a witty humorous way is what captivated me and it just spiraled from there.\n\nI grew to love him even more during his grand entrance in the Dream SMP, and it just continued as he became one of the major characters in it and had impact the lore so greatly. I was so excited to draw him in my next animatic: 'The Fall', because I liked drawing him in the 'Techno vs Dream' animation, and more importantly, I can also continue the lore of Techno's hair design haha.\n\nOn November 16, after a huge lore stream, I tweeted out if any of the Dream SMP members could message me if they have any available clear audio that I can use. The only person who ever approached me was Technoblade, and was so considerate to make a separated recording of the entire stream which was so awesome!! Especially that so many people was just talking over his epic speech. What I find funny is that despite the recording having no game audio, and other people talking, I could hear the classic clicking of his keyboard that might have been louder than him in some moments.\n\nOn that same month, he became one of my patrons and I remember just fangirling so much. I didn't know how to thank him because I was still very anxious about messaging larger creators, thought my way of appreciating someone is through gestures. And so 'Hog Hunt' was made, which was pretty centric towards his character that he plays. I tried to be not as biased and give most of the members their moments, but this one's an exception haha.\n\nAfter that, I made a few MCYT animations and slowly fell out of the fandom, although I would rewatch some of his videos that I really liked, such as SBI related content, Potato War, and videos with Skeppy. I would look up in some of Techno fanarts because they had the most creative designs of his character and I'd love each and every one of them.\n\nDespite me slowly moving out of the fandom, he still continued to support me through patron. I did felt bad because of it, especially that he was going through a tough moment at that time. He did stopped, and it kind of felt weird that I was relieved. But I believed he needed it more than I do. That was the time I finally decided to send him a proper thank you message for everything he did. Not only did he supported me, but the rest of my family and my relatives.\n\nThat was a few weeks after the unfortunate news, I was having a break out of the internet loop, and so I had to hear it from my brother. I was in denial for 3 days and heck even now. I felt so regretful that I might not have thanked him soon enough. And yet I can't help myself but admire how despite what he had been through, he remained the cool, witty and funny person that he had always been even to the end. And the impact he left with everyone is now louder than ever. He had helped so many of his audience even if those actions can't be seen by many, he still helped so much anyways.\n\nSo with all that, let me say this again:\n\nTechnoblade, Thank you so so much. For the laughs. For the wits. For the skill. For the content. For the inspiration. For the community. For the friends we made. For the kindness. For everything.\n\nIf he ever read this, I bet he'd cringe. Good.\n\nFarewell. Live on.","title":"Technoblade","duration":67,"channel_id":"UCv3Kk__aFcKKx_o2686uQcw","author":"SAD-ist","date":"20220706","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8pf2jmkRZo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/g8pf2jmkRZo/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4192983}}

He is doing this becuase it is rumored that the US mint is planning to stop making the penny starting in 2023. Once I saw his series titled ‚ÄúI Survived On $0.01 For 30 Days‚Äù I knew there was only one thing I needed to do. You see I have a habit of building the most insane builds on YouTube like transforming my bedroom into a cereal bowl, building Squid Game doll for MrBeast, and building giant boxing gloves for Jake Paul. That‚Äôs why I built Ryan Trahan the worlds largest penny to celebrate the completion of Ryan‚Äôs penny series which culminated with him delivering a penny to MrBeast. This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one! \nComment ‚ÄúSave the Penny!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Delivered a Penny to MrBeast, But I Survived On $0.01 For 30 Days, But How Ryan Trahan‚Äôs $0.01 Series Broke YouTube, But I Built Ryan Trahan The MrBeast Penny, But I Gave $100,111 To Ryan Trahan You Pick His Tattoo, But How Ryan Trahan changed YouTube with $0.01 or any other video like Ryan Trahan, MrBeast, Colin and Samir, Airrack, Paddy Galloway, Tyler Blanchard, Doctor Mike, Unspeakable or Preston would make.

Instead, the drill can plunge directly into the earth‚Äôs surface. From there, horizontal directional drilling is pretty straightforward, but it‚Äôs not necessarily straight. In fact, HDD necessarily uses a curved alignment to enter the earth, travel below a roadway or river, and exit at the surface on the other side.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
