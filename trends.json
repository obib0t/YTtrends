This was Morocco's first ever knockout stage goal. Cristiano Ronaldo would enter the game in the second half. The second half was even more of a defensive battle by both teams. Portugal was able to get a few shots on net including one in extra time by Cristiano Ronaldo but nothing went through. Walid Cheddira got a red card in extra time.

{"description":"All Money made from this video will be donated to Make-A-Wish: https://wish.org/\nSo many kids are going through a lot worse stuff than I am and Make-a-Wish does a really great job in making their dreams come true and creating positive memories.\n\nFor the last year and a half I have not been able to be physical, jump around, or do much martial arts in my videos,. This video explains why. The biggest of the eight tumors is near my tailbone and it causes a lot of pain whenever I'm standing or walking. If I try running or doing a jump it feels like a knife is being stabbed deep into my tailbone. Sitting or standing for more than 10 minutes also causes a lot of nerve pain shooting from my glutes, all the way down my hamstrings and into my calves. \n\nDuring the last year, we incorrectly worked under the diagnosis I had only a cyst in my tailbone. We tried five different smaller medical procedures (injections: epidurals, caudals). I also saw many different physical therapists three times per week over the course of eight months. After none of this was affective, we went to THE tailbone cyst expert down in Dallas, TX. He looked at the MRI scans and right away said \"That is not a cyst.\" I then saw other experts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and another in Dallas. \n\nAt USC Medical in Los Angeles we learned I had a total of eight tumors. The surgeon performed a spinal tap (not fun) to see if we could learn more about what these mysterious growths were. The results were inconclusive and now the last thing to do is to remove one of the tumors, do a biopsy on it, and learn exactly what is going on. We hope by removing the largest tumor that I'll have some pain relief as well.:","title":"I Have 8 Tumors","duration":408,"channel_id":"UCwaNuezahYT3BOjfXsne2mg","author":"Chad Wild Clay","date":"20221210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbCAu5t25m8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SbCAu5t25m8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1310086}}

{"description":"It's Episode 123 of Mike Finnegan's Garage and that means it's time to get back to work on my favorite new project and the one you've been asking for an update on...The Caddy! This 1961 Cadillac Coupe De Ville is a high strung, low slung, badass land yacht that is destined for glory both on the street and the dragstrip. The goal is to run 8 second quarter mile. passes while still  being completely streetable. \nI found the car in an airplane hangar and bought it with 46,000 miles on the odometer. It's clean, rust free, and now sports a mandrel bent pro-touring style chassis from MRC Fab. It rolls on Mickey Thompson drag radials and Weld double bead lock wheels. The engine is going to be a twin-turbo big-block Chevy with AC and power steering.

OH another cool tune i used is a SNES super mario styled remix of MF DOOM- Rapp Snitch Knishes. it was so awesome and so funny and i love DOOM so i thought itd be perfect to use.  ALSO! in the middle of the video i used an instrumental of Tyler, The Creator's- DOMO23 from the Wolf album. another classic from an album i love, the horn sections especially go so hard. \nbut yeah all in all i LOVED making this vid. something about the rawness of me and the boys coming together and stomping on the minecraft community had a fun vibe to it. OH ALSO:\n\nALL POVS USED and CREDIT!!

{"description":"Netherlands and Argentina faced off in the Quarterfinals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The first half was slow until Lionel Messi found Nahuel Molina with a beautiful lead pass and Molina put it into the back of the net for a goal. Messi had another chance later in the half but it didn’t go in and Argentina would go ahead 1-0 into the half. Messi would score by way of PK in the 73rd minute. The Netherlands wouldn’t go away quietly as Wout Weghorst scored in 83’ then he scored the equalizer in 90’ + 11’ off a genius free kick. Both teams would have great chances in extra time but none would go through and we would go to PKs. Argentina would win in PKs and would advance.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Argentina #Netherlands\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

{"description":"Back in July when I officially became sponsorless, I started thinking about exactly the bike I wanted for the first time in years. I knew I wanted a titanium hardtail, but nobody made the exact geometry I really preferred. The reach was always too long, or the size small had some bend in the seat tube that would prevent my dropper post from being inserted the whole way.\n\nThat’s when I realized that “zero-compromise” would mean having a custom frame built. So I started my conversation with Sage, who makes built to order titanium frames out of Oregon.  Not only did I get the exact geometry that I wanted, but also a custom paint job. I was against painting the titanium at all from the start, but they won me over with a custom Cerakote scheme that covers only the rear of the bike. \n\nI also picked out all the parts for this bike. Some companies I had contacts at, and I was able to get a discount or even a free part. But back when I started my orders, many companies were fresh out of stock, and so I needed to pay full retail sideways to get the parts in time.

His rep said in a statement to Inside Edition that the 68-year-old announcer \"briefly lost consciousness on the court.\" “Emergency medical professionals on-site quickly treated Rathbun for dehydration,” the statement continued.","title":"Atlanta Hawks Announcer Suffers On-Air Medical Emergency","duration":65,"channel_id":"UC9k-yiEpRHMNVOnOi_aQK8w","author":"Inside Edition","date":"20221206","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ea97RiY_6A","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ea97RiY_6A/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":10654060}}

{"description":"M3GAN - official trailer 2\nonly in theaters january 6\n\nshe's more than a toy. she's family. \n\nFrom the most prolific minds in horror—James Wan, the filmmaker behind the Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring franchises, and Blumhouse, the producer of the Halloween films, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man—comes a fresh new face in terror. \nM3GAN is a marvel of artificial intelligence, a life-like doll programmed to be a child’s greatest companion and a parent’s greatest ally. Designed by brilliant toy-company roboticist Gemma (Get Out’s Allison Williams), M3GAN can listen and watch and learn as she becomes friend and teacher, playmate and protector, for the child she is bonded to. \n\nWhen Gemma suddenly becomes the caretaker of her orphaned 8-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw, The Haunting of Hill House), Gemma’s unsure and unprepared to be a parent. Under intense pressure at work, Gemma decides to pair her M3GAN prototype with Cady in an attempt to resolve both problems—a decision that will have unimaginable consequences. \n\nProduced by Jason Blum and James Wan, M3GAN is directed by award-winning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone (Housebound), from a screenplay by Akela Cooper (Malignant, The Nun 2) based on a story by Akela Cooper and James Wan. \n\nThe film also stars Ronny Chieng (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings), Brian Jordan Alvarez (Will & Grace), Jen Van Epps (Cowboy Bebop), Lori Dungey (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, extended edition) and Stephane Garneau-Monten (Straight Forward).\n\nUniversal Pictures and Blumhouse present an Atomic Monster production in association with Divide/Conquer. The film’s executive producers are Allison Williams, Mark Katchur, Ryan Turek, Michael Clear, Judson Scott, Adam Hendricks and Greg Gilreath.\n\nWebsite: https://www.m3ganmovie.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/meetm3gan/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/meetM3GAN\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meetM3GAN\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@meetm3gan?lang=en\n#M3GAN","title":"M3GAN - official trailer 2","duration":139,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20221207","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoDHM_A1axc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OoDHM_A1axc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4241966}}

I’ve gone to great lengths to find out what it is like – from hiring 50 Spider-Man to training like Spiderman for 24 hours and spending 100 days as Spiderman in VR. Unfortunately, I just didn’t have the skills to cut it in any of these worlds so I went back to what I’m good at: building giant things! So in this video I built with world’s largest Spider-Man statue based off of a Spiderman Funko Pop and surprised @BaylenLevine with it!  This was insane and super intense to make, but I had lots of laughs along the way and it turned out incredible!!!

{"description":"A summary of the challenges with starting a grid back up from total collapse.\n🥑 For 18 FREE meals with HelloFresh plus free shipping, use code PRACTICAL18 at https://bit.ly/3UQECxk!\n\nThe grid is a little bit of a house of cards. It’s not necessarily flimsy, but if the whole thing gets knocked down, you have to rebuild it one card at a time and from the ground up. Restoring power after a major blackout is one of the most high stakes operations you can imagine. The consequences of messing it up are enormous, but there’s no way to practice a real-life scenario. It seems as simple as flipping a switch, but restoring power is more complicated than you might think.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
