{"description":"The beginning of the episode started with a recap of the prequels, ending with yoda’s line to him at the end of revenge of the sith where he tells Obi-Wan he has training for him, to teach him to commune with his old master qui-gon. So I think for sure we’ll see or hear Qui-Gon Jinn’s force ghost once again.\n\nWe start on coruscant, at the jedi temple where the younglings are being trained by a jedi master, as two 501st clones rush in to execute order 66. As she does her best to protect the younglings, she gets defeated and we see one of the younglings centred. I believe this could be a young Reva. She was a Jedi as the grand inquisitor states. We hear palpatine continuously say execute order 66 as see them running away while the temple is under attack as we saw in revenge of the sith.\n\nTransitioning to Tatooine, we see the Inquisitors land down and interrogate a cantina for the location of a Jedi hiding there. Reva uses tactics to snuff him out \nthat are very heaty in the eyes of the Grand Inquisitor, we have to remember that the senate is still a thing at this time, and isn’t disbanded quite yet. So Palpatine still doesn’t has as much free reign as he does in the original trilogy with blowing up alderaan and doing whatever he pleases whenever. The Jedi gets away and the Grand Inquisitor tells Reva he’s had enough of her wreckless behaviour and her fixation on Kenobi, that he’s not hers to find. He’s Vader’s, are my thoughts. I think she hates Kenobi so much for failing Anakin, but I could be wrong. \nWe finally meet up with Kenobi cutting sushi in the middle of the desert, making a living for himself as a regular man. Getting back to his Eopie, which could be the same one from revenge of the sith, he feeds it and heads back home. Heading to his cave, makes himself at home when he’s visited by a Jawa named TEEKA who hands Kenobi a toy ship, a lambda t4a imperial shuttle for Luke. \nWhen Teeka shows him a belt of the Jedi we just saw, telling Obi-Wan that a Jedi ran through the dune sea inquisitors after him and all and Obi-Wan says the Jedi are all extinct, now he knows that a jedi is here and the inquisitors are aware. This makes his job more difficult to protect Luke. He has to be on a higher alert now and keep watch of the boy more than usual.\n\nAs he goes to sleep, he has ptsd of Anakin and what happened to him. This is 10 years after the events of revenge of the sith, which means his ptsd was probably even worse in the years prior. He tries to reach out to qui-gon, and this isn’t the first time. The beginning of the episode started with a recap of the prequels, ending with yoda’s line to him at the end of revenge of the sith where he tells Obi-Wan he has training for him, to teach him to commune with his old master qui-gon. So to me, I think obi-wan hasn’t spoken to qui-gon yet. He;s trying, but he isn’t connecting himself to the force, he can’t. If he does, the empire will detect him. and Sniff him out like a dog to food.\n\nObi-Wan watches over Luke as he runs from Owen, much like Anakin, playful and rebellious.\n\nThrough the desert, Obi-Wan is found by Navi, the Jedi the inquisitors were after. He has a short interaction with Obi-Wan who pretends he’s not the famous Jedi Master. He finally breaks and tells the boy to forget the Jedi and let it go. To bury his lightsaber in the sand. Kenobi is a broken man. He’s hurting and he’s no longer the same hopeful man he used to be. I believe the point is to show a broken obi-wan turning into the hopeful alec guiness obi-wan we see later.\n\nOn Alderaan we meet with Leia. This is the best casting of a young Leia I’ve ever seen. I think she played the role so well. She portrays Leia’s rebellious, know it all personality while being adorable at the same time. Playing tricks on her mother and running off into the forest to explore.\n\nObi-Wan’s mundane life repeats itself and it seems like it’s really taken the wind from his sails. Heading back to his Eopie, Uncle Owen throws the toy he left for Luke onto the ground and tells Kenobi to leave them alone. Owen doesn’t like Obi-Wan for many reasons. One being that he blames Kenobi for the fall of Anakin and turn into Darth Vader, and the overall state of the galaxy. He also doesn’t like how Obi-Wan is always watching over Luke, he thinks it’ll eventually tip someone off and it’ll get them hurt all because of obi-wan snooping around and keeping watch.\n\nObi-Wan asks if Luke is ok, and owen says you don’t care if he’s ok you care if he’s showing. He means showing signs of the force. Meaning Owen thinks Kenobi only uses Luke to push him to be a Jedi like Anakin, and that didn’t turn out well.\n\nContinued in video...\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join\n\nContinue the conversation on the Theory forums!\nhttps://starwarstheory.com/THEORY/posts\n\nBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory","title":"Obi-Wan Kenobi Episode 1 BREAKDOWN","duration":857,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20220527","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScLHffxXkkE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ScLHffxXkkE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":419404}}

{"description":"Hermitcraft season 9 episode 12! We start out big with our Minecraft let's play ep 12 on the Hermitcraft 9 server with a massive starter treehouse base. The design of the survival base will be elven-themed. Once we complete the treehouse, I'll build my dream Minecraft build. \n\nToday's episode starts out adding my head to the Ravager and we team up with Grain and Pearl to win the diamond block pillar / tower to world height challenge. Also, I start on my first mega shop build. The new Hermitcraft shop is a Redstone shop built in an old historic Parisian-designed building. We will finish the interior and open the shop in the next episode! Hope you are excited about my mega base reveal soon!\n----------------------------------------------------------\nMy Links and stuff:\n\n* Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=21298347\n* Twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/GTWScar\n* Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/goodtimeswithscar\n* Instagram: http://instagram.com/goodtimeswithscar\n*TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@goodtokswithscar\n---------------------------------------------------------\nHermitcraft SMP - season 9 info and seed coming soon.\n\nFor more information and links to all things Hermitcraft, follow the link to the Hermitcraft website: https://hermitcraft.com/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Hermitcraft9 #HermitcraftSeason9 #GoodTimesWithScar","title":"Hermitcraft 9 Episode 12: New MEGA SHOP!","duration":1545,"channel_id":"UCodkNmk9oWRTIYZdr_HuSlg","author":"GoodTimesWithScar","date":"20220526","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjKJki_H7E4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KjKJki_H7E4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":496240}}

{"description":"Beast - Only In Theaters August 19\n\nSometimes the rustle in the bushes actually is a monster.\n\nIdris Elba (Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, The Suicide Squad) stars in a pulse-pounding new thriller about a father and his two teenage daughters who find themselves hunted by a massive rogue lion intent on proving that the savannah has but one apex predator.  \n\nElba plays Dr. Nate Daniels, a recently widowed husband who returns to South Africa, where he first met his wife, on a long-planned trip with their daughters to a game reserve managed by Martin Battles (Sharlto Copley, Russian Doll series, Maleficent), an old family friend and wildlife biologist. But what begins as a journey of healing jolts into a fearsome fight for survival when a lion, a survivor of blood-thirsty poachers who now sees all humans as the enemy, begins stalking them. \n\nIyana Halley (The Hate U Give, This is Us series) plays Daniels’ 18-year-old daughter, Meredith, and Leah Sava Jeffries (Rel series, Empire series) plays his 13-year-old, Norah.  \n\nFrom visceral, experiential filmmaker Baltasar Kormákur, the director of Everest and Universal Pictures’ 2 Guns and Contraband, Beast is produced by Will Packer, the blockbuster producer of Girls Trip, the Ride Along franchise, and ten movies that have opened No. 1 at the U.S. box office, including Night School, No Good Deed and Think Like a Man, by James Lopez, president of Will Packer Productions, and by Baltasar Kormákur.

{"description":"“I’m gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight.” Don’t miss Austin Butler and Tom Hanks in THE film of the summer. See Baz Luhrmann’s #ElvisMovie only in theaters June 24. ⚡️ #TCB \n\nhttps://elvis.warnerbros.com \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ElvisMovie \nhttps://www.instagram.com/ElvisMovie \nhttps://twitter.com/ElvisMovie \n\nELVIS is an epic, big-screen spectacle from Warner Bros. Pictures and visionary, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Baz Luhrmann that explores the life and music of Elvis Presley, starring Austin Butler and Oscar winner Tom Hanks. \n\nA thoroughly cinematic drama, Elvis’s (Butler) story is seen through the prism of his complicated relationship with his enigmatic manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Hanks). As told by Parker, the film delves into the complex dynamic between the two spanning over 20 years, from Presley’s rise to fame to his unprecedented stardom, against the backdrop of the evolving cultural landscape and loss of innocence in America. Central to that journey is one of the significant and influential people in Elvis’s life, Priscilla Presley (Olivia DeJonge). \n\nStarring alongside Butler and Hanks, award-winning theatre actress Helen Thomson (“Top of the Lake: China Girl,” “Rake”) plays Elvis’s mother, Gladys, Richard Roxburgh (“Moulin Rouge!” “Breath,” “Hacksaw Ridge”) portrays Elvis’s father, Vernon, and DeJonge (“The Visit,” “Stray Dolls”) plays Priscilla. Luke Bracey (“Hacksaw Ridge,” “Point Break”) plays Jerry Schilling, Natasha Bassett (“Hail, Caesar!”) plays Dixie Locke, David Wenham (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Lion,” “300”) plays Hank Snow, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (“The Trial of the Chicago 7,” “The High Note”) plays B.B.

{"description":"What if funk/fusion drummer Dennis Chambers was the drummer for Tool? \n\n(Don’t tell Danny Carey.)\n\nDennis is known for his legendary backbeat and funky style. So of course we felt mischievous and we dared him to try playing “Schism”, one of Tool’s biggest songs. It’s full of odd time signatures, quick, complex changes and unexpected accents, and Dennis had never heard it before.\n\nBut we didn’t ask him to learn the real drum parts: we wanted to see what he’d come up with on his own after hearing the song once. While you’ll hear the song with drums in this video, Dennis was actually listening to a drumless track.\n\n“This is not me,” he warned us as he listened through the track, but “in my younger days, this would’ve been up my alley!”\n\nHow will Dennis Chambers not only learn a song he’s never heard before, but in a style he’s unfamiliar with – and in odd time, at that?\n\nSince the song doesn’t have a drum track, he listens for two things: the style and the time signature. Watch Dennis’ playthrough where he gives it his own spin. It’s solid, it’s groovy, and there’s some unexpected footwork later on. It’s amazing how much a song can change with a different approach on the drums.\n\nYou’ve never heard Schism played like this before!\n\nIf you like Dennis Chambers, he has an entire 12-lesson course on funk drumming for Drumeo members.

{"description":"KEFIR WEBSITE HERE: https://www.happyherbalist.com\n\nFind out how this simple remedy can help you sleep better. \n\nDATA:\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146643#\nhttps://www.ffhdj.com/index.php/ffhd/article/view/572#:\nhttps://www.happyherbalist.com/kefir-live-grains-milk-kefir/\n\n0:00 Introduction: The best natural remedy for sleep \n0:20 What is kefir? \n1:27 Kefir benefits \n1:45 Kefir for better sleep \n3:55 The best type of kefir to consume \n4:30 How to make kefir \n5:40 Check out my video on other things that help promote sleep!\n\nSleep is so important, and I believe this remedy will help you get the sleep you need. The best natural remedy for sleep is kefir. Consume 1/2 cup of kefir before bed for better sleep. \n\nKefir is similar to yogurt, but it’s better. It has more healthy, diverse microbes than yogurt. Many of these friendly microbes also survive your stomach acids, whereas the microbes in yogurt don’t.\n\nKefir not only has friendly bacteria but friendly yeast, too. This combination is essential. People with lactose intolerance also have an easier time digesting kefir than yogurt. \n\nHealth benefits of kefir:\n • Decreased liver fat \n • Fewer allergy symptoms \n • Improved immune system \n • Decreased inflammation \n • Less constipation \n • Better blood sugar \n • Better blood pressure \n • Decreased pathogens \n\nCertain microbes make serotonin. The more of the right microbes you have, the more serotonin you’ll have. Serotonin is a hormone that can positively affect your mood and reduce stress. \n\nKefir provides microbes that make melatonin, which is a sleep hormone. Not only that, but kefir contains microbes that make the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan turns into serotonin and then melatonin. \n\nKefir is a good source of bioavailable calcium, which can help you get to sleep and stay asleep. The microbes in kefir also make certain B vitamins, which can greatly help with stress and calm a busy mind. The lactobacillus in kefir helps reduce cortisol, which will also help you sleep better. \n\nI highly recommend making your own kefir. You need something called kefir live grains (there is no grain in it) to get started. \n\nI like using goat milk, but you can use cow milk. The website I use to buy my kefir grains (happyherbalist.com) explains exactly how to make kefir. \n\nBasically, you add 1 Tbsp of the kefir grains to 1 to 2 cups of milk. Then, you set it on the counter and cover it using a cloth or paper towel and a rubber band. After 24 hours, you’ll have kefir. \n\nADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:\nhttps://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description\n\nFREE COURSE➜ ➜ http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse\n\nTalk to a Product Advisor to find the best product for you!\nCall 1-540-299-1556 with your questions about Dr. Berg's products.

{"description":"This has been a long time coming. Anyone who watches this channel knows I love night riding, but until now I have never attempted to ride Berm Peak at night. This is due to a variety of reasons, most of which should be pretty obvious. Bike lights are designed for singletrack—not wallrides and whale tails. Tonight, we throw caution to the wind and give it a shot on my backyard mountain bike trails.\n\nAlso tonight, we’ll test out some new lights from Outbound Lighting. I met the owner of the company at Sedona Mountain Bike Festival, holding down the booth all by himself. Tom is not only an entrepreneur, but an engineer, so we can be sure Outbound’s marketing department isn’t getting in the way of the important stuff. These lights were remarkably simple, free of gimmicks, very well thought out, and very bright. They also turn on and off with simple taps of the power button instead of confounding combinations that so many other manufacturers insist on. Best of all, they’re really fairly priced for what you’re getting. So I’m going to run these long term and see how they work out!\n\nTrail Evo (flood light) https://www.outboundlighting.com/products/trail-evo-bike-light\nHangover (spot light) https://www.outboundlighting.com/products/hangover-bike-helmet-light\n\nBerm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts\nhttps://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nWant us to review your unique mountain bike or outdoor product? https://www.sethsbikehacks.com/product-review/\n\nCheck out our main channel https://youtube.com/c/sethsbikehacks\nFollow me on Instagram https://instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nBerm Peak Merch https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nMusic in this video is from \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg\nand https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20\n\nJoin my Patreon and 100% of the proceeds go towards projects in the mountain biking community.

{"description":"Today’s Roblox In a Nutshell will be on Bee Swarm Simulator.\n\nRoblox Bee Swarm simulator is a classic Roblox simulator game where you walk around with your bees to collect pollen and honey so you can get better equipment to get pollen and honey faster.\n\nLike all the other Roblox simulator games, the objective is to get STRONG and RICH. To get from noob to pro, the player needs to buy more bees, improve their bee hive, buy better equipment, complete quests, kill mobs, complete challenges, and use codes to get some items. The better stuff the player gets, the more honey and pollen they will gather. The game is very grindy, just like all other simulators, and most people would use macros or scripts to farm.\n\nThere are 45 types of bees, and they all have different stats and abilities. Since the maximum number of bees a player can have is 50, they need to find the best hive build (combination of bees) to get honey fast. Rarer bees are usually higher on the tier list, and some, like the windy bee, are hard to obtain.\n\nOn top of bees, people need to grind for equipment and items like Tide Popper, Dark Scythe, Gummyballer, translator, and The Planter Of Plenty to farm more efficiently. They let the player gather more pollen, unlock new quests and drop better stuff.\n\nThis video will show you everything there is to the game. It is not a complete guide, but there are some tips you can follow to get more honey. \n\nLike always, this video is filled with a crap ton of dead memes in the form of funny moments/montages. Bee Swarm Simulator used to have events like the Christmas 2021 event with snowflakes and gingerbread bears, but since then, there has been no update. I hope you enjoyed this Bee Swarm Simulator video. Don’t forget to subscribe and spam E.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis video contains a crap load of dead memes and bad jokes.

Meet friendly bears, complete their quests and get rewards! As your hive grows larger and larger, you can explore further up the mountain. Use your bees to defeat dangerous bugs and monsters. Look for treasures hidden around the map. Discover new types of bees, all with their own traits and personalities!\n\nWhat is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.","title":"Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator In A Nutshell","duration":871,"channel_id":"UCH6sNLmH-rsATLffdpGYscQ","author":"Tank Fish","date":"20220521","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsCPBinDLg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LLsCPBinDLg/hqdefault.jpg?v=62873151","content":{"View count":815254}}
