One of the many things that makes living off the grid so difficult, beyond the distance, isolation and logistics of surviving in -20 degree weather, is the psychological games your mind can play when you hear sounds in the woods. And as it turns out near the end of this episode, we weren't just imagining things! We were scared half to death, and we have @talandmads to confirm it. This will make much more sense after you watch this episode! And speaking of, we either did something very right, or very wrong with the drywall. We are bracing for the comments on this one, because things looked smooth and level when we went to sleep, but a little off the next day. Did our drywall catfish us?! We love all the helpful comments from our Patreon Pack, and we read all of them, thank you! After a long week of hard work and a few setbacks, nothing like seeing some friendly faces will lift your spirits. It's good to be reminded: if you fail, try again!

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

{"description":"Hey guys! today I am going to be unboxing a bunch of used, damaged squishies that have been sent to me from you guys! I plan on using some of these for my squishy makeover series, where I fix and redecorate  old squishies and create custom art creations. Let me know which squishies you think I should use in the next episode in the comments!\n\n\nFOR ANY NEW PEOPLE:\nToday I am going to be opening a bunch of boxes/packages from my subscribers. Basically \"fanmail\" or P.O. box unboxing, BUT most of these packages are used, dirty, old squishies sent to me from people who no longer want them. I like to fix them up, paint over them, customize them and decorate them to create new works of ART for my video series called \"Squishy Makeovers\". Soooooo every once in a while I like to do these videos, looking through all the candidates I've been sent. It's always very interesting seeing which squishies I get and how bad of condition they are. Plus there are some cute extra gifts thrown in from my very generous viewers that are fun to look through. My current P.O. box address is kept private because I have been overloaded with mail in the past, so I only give it out by request to a handful of people each week (email address to request it, bottom of description). The address you see on a lot of the old packages in this video is NOT my current address, I no longer have access to it. Let me know in the comments which squishies you would like to see in the next squishy makeover episode.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

The lady's brother-in-law, Diamond Platnumz, is having a broken-hearted telepathic conversation with his late brother about the new woman Zuwena has become, and all the hardships she has put them through, including spending all the money, not being there for her mother-in-law, becoming a hussy, and living an extravagant lifestyle.For your listening pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, we present Zuwena, exemplifying the kind of song delivery and performance that has kept Diamond as Platnumz for over a decade.\n\nVideo Shot by Directo Ivan\n\nDiamond Platnumz Booking Info:\nEmail:bookplatnumz@gmail.com | sallam.sharaff@gmail.com\n\nCatch Up With Diamond Platnumz On:\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/diamondplatnumz/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/DiamondPlatnumz255/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/diamondplatnumz/\n\n#Diamondplatnumz #wasafi #music","title":"Diamond Platnumz - Zuwena (Official Music Video)","duration":241,"channel_id":"UCev-b-xy-p5fHK8x3zJyn1Q","author":"Diamond Platnumz","date":"20230203","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOAjuAI0nJA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aOAjuAI0nJA/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3088539}}

Dillon Brooks missed a shot driving to the hoop and one of his arms hit Donovan Mitchell while Brooks was on the ground. Mitchell responded by throwing the ball at Brooks and a full scuffle ensued.

Cast iron is iron that has a very high carbon content. Its good properties are that it's very hard and has a low melting point. The drawback is that it's relatively brittle compared to regular iron. So I set about trying to find a method for reducing its carbon content.\n\n In this video I smelted local ore (iron bacteria) and obtained cast iron prills. I then tried melting it in a small crucible to obtain a solid ingot to begin the experiment. This gave a poor result though with an incomplete melt. \n\nNext I tried rusting the prills first with the intent of creating iron oxide (rust ) in the iron so that the next melt would combine the materials in an exothermic reaction that would burn the carbon out. In the past, rusty iron was added to cast iron to decarburize it (wet puddling/pig boiling). But this also gave poor results.\n\n Finally, I did away with the mold and simply melted the iron prills by dropping them into the forge in front of the hot air blast of the forge. The reasoning was that the high oxygen would burn out the carbon from the metal. This caused them to melt together to form an ingot. After a few attempts I took one of the ingots and hammered it while still white to yellow hot and hammered it with a stone. The ingot was able to be flattened as it had become malleable. This was the result I wanted.\n\nThis method of decarburization (melting cast iron in a open hearth to make it malleable) was used throughout history at different times. In ancient China it was known as \"stir fried steel/ ÁÇíÈí¢\" and in the west known as the \"Osmond process\". I also read that in India, cast iron ingots from the crucible were brought to a temperature just below melting point before becoming forgeable. \nIn future experiments I hope to use this technique to decarburize iron ingots to make into forged metal tools as opposed to the cast knife I made in a previous video. \n\nChapters: \n00:00 Overview of my standard smelting process\n00:50 Crucible ingot (failure)\n02:21 Decarburization via rusting (failure)\n04:22 Decarburization without crucible (inconclusive)\n05:45 Decarburization without crucible/forging  (success)\n07:01 Decarburized and forged iron result\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

That‚Äôs why I was stoked when Adin Ross reached out and asked if I could build him a custom Cristiano Ronaldo statue to surprise Speed with for his birthday livestream! You see, I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, Giant Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom, and a Real Life Squid Games Doll), but I've never built something made of triangles. The Beem Team and I decided to take things over the top for this by making the statue life size and wearing the uniform from the 2022 World Cup. To top things off, we only had 7 days to build it because everything is always last minute. After doing 20 hour days, we got barely got it done in time and had to deliver it accross the country to California. Both iShowSpeed and Adin Ross were AMAZED at how good the statue turned out turned out! This build was a real struggle to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one! \nComment ‚ÄúSpeed Loves Ronaldo!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot i seen Ronaldo Vs Messi for the last time, But Adin Gifts IShowSpeed A RONALDO STATUE, But IShowSpeed - World Cup (Official Music Video), But Adin Gives iShowSpeed His DREAM Birthday Gift, But iShowSpeed Meets Ronaldo In Person, But KSI Facetimes Adin Ross & iShowSpeed on Stream, But Speed Reacts To Ronaldo's Saddest Moments, But iShowSpeed FINALLY Packs Ronaldo, But Packgod vs IShowSpeed, But iShowSpeed Reacts To Ronaldo Shouting Him Out, But Ronaldo Sent Me This, But MY BIRTHDAY STREM, or any other video like PACKGOD, Live Speedy, Speedy Boykins, IShowSpeed, Adin Ross, Adin Live, MrBeast, Airrack, Unspeakable, Stokes Twins, Ben Azelart, or Brent Rivera.

{"description":"In 2005, Resident Evil 4 changed the face of survival horror. The game‚Äôs phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer‚Äôs cover this month.\n \nWe visited Capcom‚Äôs headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil 4 and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. Viewers can also look forward to never-before-seen gameplay and a new Rapid Fire interview.\n \nBeginning today, digital magazine subscribers can read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley‚Äôs gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.\n \nTo keep up with all our coverage, bookmark GameInformer.com/ResidentEvil4 and subscribe to our YouTube channel.
