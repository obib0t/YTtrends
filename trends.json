But recently, a new name has become synonymous with indie film culture and appeal, and it’s not an individual, but a studio.\n\nYou have to admit, their logo is pretty cool.\n\nA24 swept the 2022 Oscars. They’ve made some of the most distinct and interesting movies and TV shows of the past 10 years. But most importantly, they’ve garnered a reputation for quality — and their brand loyalty so strong that hipster film bros everywhere are wearing A24 t-shirts and caps right now.\n\nBut unlike Universal or Paramount, studios that have been around for over a century, A24 has done this in just over a decade. How did this independent film distributor transform into a major player in the entertainment industry in such a short time?\n\nIn this Vox Video, Nate Jones (senior writer at Vulture, and A24 obsessor) breaks down their history, and stratospheric rise to the top.

{"description":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom reviewed by Tom Marks on Nintendo Switch.\n\nThis is an unfathomable sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas with an alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds.\n\n#IGN #LegendOfZelda","title":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review","duration":876,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdVO_fYoF5g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZdVO_fYoF5g/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1547082}}

It will demand your creativity and ingenuity in a way that few games would dare demand. It pays tribute to the things that have made this series so timeless, while also innovating so relentlessly that it will be the better part of a decade before any game is able to follow in its wake. Nearly four decades after The Legend of Zelda series made its debut, its latest instalment is a breathtaking high-point for the Zelda franchise, for Nintendo and for videogames.\n\nFor those that prefer write-ups, I've published a written version of this review over at Wellplayed.com.au.

But their mission is complicated by the beginning of a geopolitical firestorm: The American Revolution has arrived. In the seventh season of OUTLANDER, Jamie, Claire, and their family are caught in the violent birth pains of an emerging nation as armies march to war and British institutions crumble in the face of armed rebellion.\nThe land the Frasers call home is changing – and they must change with it. In order to protect what they’ve built, the Frasers have to navigate the perils of the Revolutionary War. They learn that sometimes to defend what you love, you have to leave it behind. As the conflict draws them out of North Carolina and into the heart of this fight for independence, Jamie, Claire, Brianna, and Roger are faced with impossible decisions that have the potential to tear their family apart.","title":"Outlander | Season 7 Official Trailer | STARZ","duration":162,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxurD9SYbog","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gxurD9SYbog/hqdefault.jpg?v=645d26e3","content":{"View count":4201590}}

Maybe you’ve seen it as glowing green goop in The Simpsons, or as a  radioactive threat on the news. Either way, you likely know it has been a major block to the use and improvement of nuclear power. Over the last few decades, experts, politicians and the public have had heated debates over what to do with this radioactive material created by nuclear power plants.\n\nBut what if there were a way to not just store nuclear waste, but actually USE it? \n\nThis video is about the effort to make electricity out of nuclear waste. Really. It turns out, we developed the tools to do this decades ago. This story is about a technology we left behind and the people who want to bring it back.\n\nFor this video, I had the privilege of visiting one of the largest and oldest research centers in the US, the Argonne National Laboratory. I’m incredibly grateful to the researchers and staff I met there, and for their time in showing me their work. I also had the opportunity to speak with representatives from Oklo, a company working on new forms of nuclear power, including recycling nuclear waste as fuel. One of the best parts of making Huge If True is meeting and learning from people pushing what we can do in the hopes of improving the world for everyone else.\n\nChapters: \n00:00 Nuclear waste isn’t what I thought\n02:21 How I got obsessed\n03:27 How much energy is in nuclear waste?\n05:31 Thank you Storyblocks!\n06:20 How do you get electricity?\n06:50 What is uranium?\n07:28 How does a nuclear reaction work?\n08:05 Why is nuclear waste dangerous?\n08:40 What do we do with nuclear waste?\n09:35 How do you make electricity from nuclear waste?\n11:21 Why doesn’t the US reuse nuclear fuel?\n12:20 Is recycling waste feasible?\n13:41 What is Huge If True?\n\nCorrections:\n07:09 The number refers to the total number of nucleons (either a proton or a neutron) in the atom, not the neutrons alone. A U-235 atom contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons (an atomic mass of 235). The U-238 atom also has 92 protons but has 146 neutrons (an atomic mass of 238). I should have said these *differ* by the number of neutrons in the atom.

{"description":"Oppenheimer - Only In Theaters 7 21 23\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. \n \nThe film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. Oscar® winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award® nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar® winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar® nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\nOppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography. \n\nNolan’s films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations. \n\nSocial Handles:\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/oppenheimermovie    \nTW: https://www.twitter.com/@oppenheimerfilm  \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OppenheimerMovie \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/OppenheimerMovie/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/oppenheimermovie\nWebsite: https://www.OppenheimerMovie.com   \n#Oppenheimer","title":"Oppenheimer | New Trailer","duration":187,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230508","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYPbbksJxIg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uYPbbksJxIg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":20017897}}

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to our next installment of our nordic/Scandinavian travel trip! After taking a warm bath in the Blue Lagoon in Iceland - I thought - let’s chill out a bit - literally - and head to the original Ice Hotel in Northern Sweden! Yes, this hotel is made completely out of ice and snow, and it melts and gets rebuilt every year - and yes, people actually sleep in here!! I'm very interested by **strange hotels** and after our trip to the Underwater Hotel last year, when I heard of the ICEHOTEL - I figured, we better check it out. So, after a brief moment being stuck in Iceland, we headed to the ICEHOTEL to investigate & spend the night - and hopefully not get cryogenically frozen like Walt Disney's head.

Steph Curry had a 31-point triple-double and two looks at the end of the game to make a go-ahead basket but couldn’t connect with AD playing defense on him.

Thanks to AG1 for sponsoring Click here: https://athleticgreens.com/tylerandtodd to get up to a year's supply of immune supporting Vitamin D + 5 individual travel packs, both FREE with your first purchase! \n\nThe idea to build a shipping container home was definitely one of the wildest ones we've had and if you've been joining our weekly videos for any amount of time you know that's saying something. It feels absolutely incredible that the container home FINALLY has a consistent and reliable source of heat...just in time for the holidays!

Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01SSGRLDNS2I5","title":"Build a Shipping Container Home they said...","duration":1526,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20230507","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksDaL45rsQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uksDaL45rsQ/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":165754}}
