I first built the frame which was made of two tripods set close together. They were of wood and lashed together with cane. Then I made a basket from cane to hold the large rocks that would act as the counterweight. For the sling I used bark fiber from dead branches of a certain type of tree. The bark was stripped and the inner bark woven into rope. The rope was then made into a sling using 2 knots and thinner rope was used to weave the sling pouch. A simple toggle release was used hold the throwing arm in position and act as the trigger. The counter weight was then filled with rocks and pulled into position to be held by the toggle. A shot-put sized stone was then placed into the sling pouch. When the toggle was released the stone would be launched 18- 20 meters (the length of the clearing) but could undoubtedly shoot further if more weight was added. Targets were set up and destroyed. Range can be adjusted by adding or subtracting weight from the basket, while shooting to the left or right is done by turning the whole catapult while the basket is empty. The whole build took 5 weeks, the hardest part being collecting the bark fiber to make the rope. The trebuchet is a simple but effective way to deliver payloads to a target destination.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Chocolate covered ice cream bars are similar to gold bars, except they are made of different materials. The materials are ice cream and chocolate, as opposed to gold.\n\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nBook http://yousuckatcooking.com\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\n\nRecipe\n\nLike most ice cream bar recipes, we're taking two well known recipes and combinating them: no churn ice cream, and home made magic shell, both of which have been around since the dawn of time. \n\nThe Ice Cream\n2 cups of heavy cream or whipping cream \nWhip it or don't whip it  \n1 can of sweetened condensed milk (small can, 300-400ml/14oz)\n1 teaspoon of vanilla extract \n\nCombine those things together. A lot of recipes say you should mix the vanilla with the condensed milk first but I'm skeptical that it makes a difference. Even more skeptical as I am of Sasquatch because I'm not skeptical of Sasquatch at all because they're real. \n\nSo pour your non-iced cream into ice cream moulds and freeze them overnight. Don't dick around and try to freeze them for just a few hours. You need the ice cream to be mega cold for this to work. \n\nMagic Shell\n\nMelt two bags of chocolate chips or another kind of chocolate \nAdd 1 or 2 tablespoon of coconut oil but don't over do it \n\nMelt that stuff in a double boiler then wait for it to cool all the way down \n\nI'm gonna be honest with you...even as I thought I got the hang of this I was still messing it up when I was trying to make more. The weird thing was the first couple came out fine then the one after that slipped off. WHY? I don't know.  But one thing I know is you gotta refreeze those bars after you take them out if there is any meltitude on the outside. If you have molds that let you pull them out without them melting, then congratulations. \n\nBut yeah, if you figure out which chocolate works best lemme know. \n\nAnyway, cold ice cream, not hot chocolate, give it a dip, let a lot of the chocolate drip off, then hold it in the hair until it sets before you lay it back in a container for freezing. \n\nI could have gotten into all these details in the video but, you know, I got distracted. \n\nEmma explains it better and I got the no-whipping tip from her: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es1XDaX0n3g","title":"Easy Chocolate Covered Ice Cream Bars Recipe","duration":270,"channel_id":"UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w","author":"You Suck At Cooking","date":"20220804","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3d0zQRPk4U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/T3d0zQRPk4U/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":227611}}

{"description":"Machine Gun Kelly, iann dior - fake love don‚Äôt last (Official Live Performance) \n\nWhether rapping, as he did in the early part of his career, or rocking, as he's doing these days, Machine Gun Kelly is one of those artists who starts fierce and gets fiercer. That impact comes from the punch of emotion at the core of his tunes - the guy comes on strong from the get-go. You can hear it on 2012's \"Wild Boy\" from his 'Lace Up' debut, and it's there on both the 'BINGE' and 'bloom' albums from a few years ago. In May, Billboard said \"there‚Äôs no one on the charts serving balls-to-the-wall rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll decadence like the 31-year-old musician.\" It's hard to disagree. Since he turned a punk-pop corner with blistering guitar tracks such as \"bloody valentine\" - a blitzkrieg bop if there ever was one - the Halsey duet \"forget me too,\" and his blackbear romp \"my ex's best friend,\" he's moved from respected cool guy to flat-out superstar. And he takes the success in stride; the name of his latest album is 'mainstream sellout.' If you caught the Billboard Awards in May, you know he poured it all out in his performance of \"Twin Flame.\" So much so that his sweetie Megan Fox tweeted her approval in a gushing example of PDA. \"Baby ‚Äì so proud of you for giving such a vulnerable and emotional performance. You are magic.\" We also know that MGK has a cheeky side too, especially when talking about ex‚Äôs. ‚ÄúMood‚Äù singer iann dior joined the show for ‚Äúfake love don‚Äôt last,‚Äù a pop punk bop that sticks in your head regardless of relationship status. \n\nWatch the official video of \"more than life\": https://youtu.be/BokDch3_g-Y\nWatch music videos by Machine Gun Kelly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUs8sGiP4avNaYNVO22INhQ\n\nMachine Gun Kelly \nhttps://tiktok.com/@machinegunkelly\nhttp://twitter.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://instagram.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://facebook.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://machinegunkelly.com\n\nVevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\nDirector: Kyle Goldberg\nDirector of Photography: Skyler Brown\nSenior Line Producer: Jen Bates\nLine Producer: Maddy Schmidt\nProducer: Averi Smith\nProducer, Contrast Films: Haley Sliger\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nArt Director: Daniel Erb\n1st AD: Evan Coniglio\nProduction Coordinator: Cole Emery\n2nd AD: Aris Ray\n1st AC: Adam Marquez\n1st AC: Ben Steen\n2nd AC: Melissa Kirchho\n2nd AC: Keith Hudson\nJib/Crane Op: Christian Hurley\nCrane Tech: Harrison Reilly\nCrane Tech: Lucas Reilly\nDIT: Benjamin Crump\nProduction Assistant: Jordan Dominguez\nProduction Assistant: Mario Arita\nProduction Assistant: Dilllon Weidler\nProduction Assistant: Johnny Baez\nProduction Assistant: Matt Callahan\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nOn Set Dresser: Eric Moore\nOn Set Dresser: Tim Miller\nOn Set Dresser: Sydney Weinberger\nLighting Designer: Josh Beard\nKey Grip: Julien Janigo\nBest Boy Grip: Darrin Stuckwisch\nVFX Supervisor: Sydney Emery\nVFX: Austin Prahl\nMotion Design: Sydney Emery\nMotion Design: Jakub Blank\nDesign: Nick Resnicow\nPhotography: Brandon Bowen\nAudio: Casey Graham\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nColor: Company 3\nColorist: Joseph Bicknell\nPost Production Supervisor: Michael Colman\nProject Manager, Post Production: Dominic Siri\nMusic + Talent: Gabriela Prisciandaro + David McTiernan\n\n#MachineGunKelly  #fakelovedontlast  #mainstreamsellout  \n\nMusic video by Machine Gun Kelly, iann dior performing fake love don‚Äôt last (Official Live Performance). ¬© 2022 Bad Boy/Interscope Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/pYnx2p","title":"Machine Gun Kelly, iann dior - fake love don‚Äôt last (Official Live Performance) | Vevo","duration":145,"channel_id":"UC2a9zmrdjvLsrRgi4G4blWw","author":"MGKVEVO","date":"20220803","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs39Lj_LvWU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hs39Lj_LvWU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":836756}}

{"description":"Two-division world champion Danny ‚ÄúSwift Garcia dominated in his super welterweight debut Saturday night, cruising to a majority decision victory over exciting contender Jose Benavidez Jr. in the SHOWTIME main event from Barclays Center in Brooklyn headlining a Premier Boxing Champions event. He saved perhaps his most expressive moment post-fight when he broke down in the ring discussing his struggles with mental health with SHOWTIME reporter Jim Gray, showing the authenticity that has made him such a fan-favorite in Brooklyn. \n \n‚ÄúI did take a break going through mental things, things went dark, I went through anxiety, deep depression, just trying to be strong,‚Äù said a visibly emotional Garcia. ‚ÄúIt was the pressure of life, being a good dad, just letting it out right now, because it was all stuck inside. It rained on me for a year and a half and the only way to do better was to fight again. I‚Äôm a fighter. If you battle anxiety and depression, you can get out of it, that‚Äôs what I did today. I fought.‚Äù\n \nPhiladelphia‚Äôs Garcia (37-3, 21 KOs) has become a staple at Barclays Center ever since headlining the arena‚Äôs first boxing event in 2012, and his return on Saturday night against Benavidez (27-2-1, 18 KOs), saw him pick up his seventh victory in Brooklyn.\n\n#DannyGarcia #JoseBenavidez #GarciaBenavidez\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Garcia vs Benavidez HIGHLIGHTS: July 30, 2022 | PBC on Showtime","duration":84,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20220731","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1vtJsi8KY8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G1vtJsi8KY8/hqdefault.jpg?v=62e7faf4","content":{"View count":718212}}

{"description":"We finished our pre-season campaign in fine style by thrashing Sevilla 6-0 to claim the Emirates Cup, with Gabriel Jesus making an instant impression on his new supporters by grabbing a hat-trick.\n\nA capacity crowd were treated to four goals in the opening 20 minutes, courtesy of braces from Bukayo Saka and Jesus, with the Brazilian striker completing his treble on 77 minutes before Eddie Nketiah got in on the act in the final minute.\n\nThe performance, clinical finishing and clean sheet ensured it was a wonderful afternoon‚Äôs work for Mikel Arteta‚Äôs men, who look well-prepared for the Premier League starting in six days‚Äô time.\n\nThe atmosphere was buoyant at Emirates Stadium before kick-off, which only increased during the opening 20 minutes as we ran riot and found the net four times to stun our opponents.\n\nThe scoring began in the 10th minute when Martin Odegaard clipped a ball over the top for Saka to chase, who was inexplicably pushed over by Karim Rekik, leaving referee Andy Madley no option but to award a penalty, which Saka stroked home.\n\nThe lead was swiftly doubled two minutes later when Ben White‚Äôs crossfield pass picked out Jesus on the left touchline, who then found Granit Xhaka. After edging his way into the box, his low cross was parried by Bono into the path of the onrushing Jesus, who had the simple task of tucking the chance away.\n\nAnd after giving the majority of supporters their first glimpse of his famous telephone celebration in Arsenal colours, he was at it again two minutes later. Again the threat came down the left but this time through Gabriel Martinelli, and with the Sevilla defence sleeping, a teasing cross allowed Jesus to race in behind and dispatch the delivery into the net.\n\nSevilla had completely lost their heads, and that was typified by our fourth goal. A routine pass back to Bono saw the goalkeeper fluff a weak clearance straight to Saka, whose first-time effort trickled through the shot-stopper‚Äôs legs to cap off an incredible start.\n\nGlee was spreading around the stadium, and none more so than on the pitch, with Arteta‚Äôs team producing plenty of slick passing and looking threatening every time they entered the final third.\n\nDuring a couple of rare forays forward for the visitors in the first half, Youssef En-Nesyri flashed a shot just wide before heading straight at Aaron Ramsdale - a feat Thomas Partey repeated following a corner, before a remarkable half ended with Bono clawing back some redemption by making a double save to deny both Jesus and Odegaard, and then denying Martinelli one-on-one.\n\nIt was a much tighter affair immediately after the break, with Rekik heading a corner just wide 10 minutes after the restart, but we were working through the gears again and after Jesus dragged an attempt from 25 yards wide, Oleksandr Zinchenko picked out Odegaard in the box but he blasted over.\n\nMidway through the second half there was almost a delightful goal to cheer when Partey chipped a ball over the backline for Xhaka, and his side-footed volley narrowly missed the top corner, but on 77 minutes the long wait for another goal ended.\n\nA Martinelli corner caused havoc as Gabriel forced Bono into a close-range save, but Jesus was on hand to drive home the rebound, complete his treble and register his seventh goal in just five pre-season outings.\n\nWhite almost put the cap on the result when a clever free-kick routine saw him attempt to lob Bono but it drifted wide, but in the final minute a sixth was added when Xhaka showed good skill to play in Martinelli, and after carrying the ball 40 yards the Brazilian unselfishly squared to Nketiah to complete the rout.\n\nThe final whistle was greeted with rapturous applause by those in attendance, who stayed to watch Odegaard get his hands on the Emirates Cup trophy to mark our sixth triumph in the competition‚Äôs history.\n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Jesus, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Nikita Parris, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White, Thomas Partey and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok","title":"HIGHLIGHTS | Arsenal vs Sevilla (6-0) | Gabriel Jesus scores a hat-trick on Emirates Stadium debut!","duration":334,"channel_id":"UCpryVRk_VDudG8SHXgWcG0w","author":"Arsenal","date":"20220731","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edAcHy1_95w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/edAcHy1_95w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4316857}}
