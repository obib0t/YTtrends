{"description":"All Money made from this video will be donated to Make-A-Wish: https://wish.org/\nSo many kids are going through a lot worse stuff than I am and Make-a-Wish does a really great job in making their dreams come true and creating positive memories.\n\nFor the last year and a half I have not been able to be physical, jump around, or do much martial arts in my videos,. This video explains why. The biggest of the eight tumors is near my tailbone and it causes a lot of pain whenever I'm standing or walking. If I try running or doing a jump it feels like a knife is being stabbed deep into my tailbone. Sitting or standing for more than 10 minutes also causes a lot of nerve pain shooting from my glutes, all the way down my hamstrings and into my calves. \n\nDuring the last year, we incorrectly worked under the diagnosis I had only a cyst in my tailbone. We tried five different smaller medical procedures (injections: epidurals, caudals). I also saw many different physical therapists three times per week over the course of eight months. After none of this was affective, we went to THE tailbone cyst expert down in Dallas, TX. He looked at the MRI scans and right away said \"That is not a cyst.\" I then saw other experts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and another in Dallas. \n\nAt USC Medical in Los Angeles we learned I had a total of eight tumors. The surgeon performed a spinal tap (not fun) to see if we could learn more about what these mysterious growths were. The results were inconclusive and now the last thing to do is to remove one of the tumors, do a biopsy on it, and learn exactly what is going on. We hope by removing the largest tumor that I'll have some pain relief as well.:","title":"I Have 8 Tumors","duration":408,"channel_id":"UCwaNuezahYT3BOjfXsne2mg","author":"Chad Wild Clay","date":"20221210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbCAu5t25m8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SbCAu5t25m8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":930814}}

\nThis the game plan \nSit back and pay attention  \nThis is how the games ran \n\nI had to switch up the pace  \nI had to build up my name  \nYuh  \nI had to make up a way  \nNow they all ridin‚Äô my wave  \nHuh  \n\nHooked top of my class \nHidden gems among treasures \nAccumulated these plaques \nWe wrote a million letters  \n\nDon‚Äôt you worry about a thing  \nCome follow our lead now  \n\nWe got you, we got you \n\nMake a faulty move started losing out  \n\nTogether the more we get done  \nQuicker the outcome the sum  \nObstacles hang in the way of the prize together we all going to rise\nPeaking now  \nSo close to the top  \nI can almost see and reach the clouds  \nThis the beginning let ‚Äòem all find out\n\nHolding onto distant recollections \nI‚Äôve been waiting for this day to play this  \n\nBeen making some changes had to get it all aligned \nuh uh \nHad to sacrifice my nights to get up on ahead \nuh uh \n\nJust hold it in to the end  \nIt makes a difference when you started from the bottom and just barely hit the ceiling  \n\n321 \n\nHold it down  \nSit back and watch the team  \nHold it down  \nThis isn‚Äôt on the screens\nWorld in my palms feel the bass \nThis the contrary  \n\nWere weary  \nWe‚Äôre ready  \n\nI‚Äôm solo \nAin‚Äôt no secrets now \nBeen on my own  \nOn the brink of geeking out \nThis is the pinnacle  \nNo contradiction though  \nWe‚Äôre not ordinary  \n\nSo divine  \nI had to check if it was real \nOverdue in time \nCatching up with a future self  \n\nFull throttle, full throttle  \nGotta make this last forever  \nThe motto, this the motto  \nWork hard to make your future better \n\nMy heart is bleeding from the pain that I put my own self through  \nThere‚Äôs no need for introductions or greetings it‚Äôs old news  \n\nI‚Äôll admit it, I‚Äôll admit it, it was kind of scary  \nI had to bury all my demons like the mortuary  \n\nHolding onto distant recollections \nI‚Äôve been waiting for this day to play this  \n\nBeen making some changes had to get it all aligned \nuh uh \nHad to sacrifice my nights to get up on ahead \nuh uh \n\nJust hold it in to the end  \nIt makes a difference when you started from the bottom

{"description":"A summary of the challenges with starting a grid back up from total collapse.\nü•ë For 18 FREE meals with HelloFresh plus free shipping, use code PRACTICAL18 at https://bit.ly/3UQECxk!\n\nThe grid is a little bit of a house of cards. It‚Äôs not necessarily flimsy, but if the whole thing gets knocked down, you have to rebuild it one card at a time and from the ground up. Restoring power after a major blackout is one of the most high stakes operations you can imagine. The consequences of messing it up are enormous, but there‚Äôs no way to practice a real-life scenario. It seems as simple as flipping a switch, but restoring power is more complicated than you might think.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

This video covers a massive showcase, optimal Wanderer build guide & my thoughts about him!\n\n In this video I cover almost everything you need to know in this Wanderer Showcase video - I went through many, MANY different Wanderer weapons and artifacts, tested about 10 different Wanderer builds, checked how good is Wanderer DPS and ultimately - I want to present you this video as one stop solution to decide if Wanderer is worth it.\n\nIn addition to this, I've tested about 6 different best Wanderer teams, examined what Wanderer skills can do and even dug deep into how much investment Wanderer needs. You'll also see things like popular Wanderer + Faruzan team showcased, popular variation of Hyper Wanderer, Wanderer damage going really well using Dodoco Tales weapon catalyst and MORE.\n\n0:00 What you can expect from this video\n0:10 Damage Potential & Skills Showcase \n5:50 Wandere Showcase, Teams & Builds\n10:07 Overall Thoughts, Should You Pull Wanderer?\n\nWanderer also known as Scaramouche was released during 3.3 Genshin Impact update.\n\nGenshin Impact is an open-world gacha game that's available on PC, PS4, PS5 and mobile devices (iOS & Android).

Get 10% off your first month of therapy with our sponsor BetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/cinematherapy\n\nHow do you find happiness and purpose in life after loss?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are both crying because they‚Äôre reacting to Pixar‚Äôs Up. They talk about Carl‚Äôs reluctance to move on and find a new life without Ellie, and they cry watching the montage about their life. They talk about Pixar‚Äôs perfect screenplay and physical comedy, and they cry about that. They discuss how life can continue after loss, finding new joys and purpose, and Jonathan almost leaves and lets Alan do the show by himself because Up is his kryptonite..

From vengeful ex-employees, to viruses that could brick your PC, to rival game websites hacking and deleting accounts to, of course, the legend of Dr. Quack, an evil NPC hellbent on maiming pets. Today let's take a look back at the 'Webkinz Killer' rumour!\n\n‚ù§Ô∏é‚ù§Ô∏é SOCIAL MEDIA ‚ù§Ô∏é‚ù§Ô∏é\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/Izzzyzzz\n\nMerch - https://www.izzzyzzz.com/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/IzzzyzzzArt\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/izzzyzzz/‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã\n‚Äã\nEmail [business inquiries only] - izzzyzzz@delkatalents.com\n\n‚ù§Ô∏é‚ù§Ô∏é MUSIC ‚ù§Ô∏é‚ù§Ô∏é\nPetz Catz 2 OST\n\n‚ù§Ô∏é‚ù§Ô∏é DISCLAIMER ‚ù§Ô∏é‚ù§Ô∏é\nAll credit goes to the musicians and composers!
