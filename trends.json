{"description":"Check out the best shots of the day from the final round and playoff of the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic, featuring Rickie Fowler, Collin Morikawa, Adam Hadwin, and Max Homa.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PGA TOUR heads to Detroit, Michigan, this week for the fifth installment of the Rocket Mortgage Classic at Detroit Golf Club. Last year‚Äôs champion Tony Finau returns to defend his record-setting title. Finau finished with a score of 26-under-par to break the tournament scoring record by three shots, posting just one bogey on the week. He‚Äôll be accompanied by an in-form Rickie Fowler in the field. He‚Äôs finished inside the top-13 in his last four events, including a T5 finish at the U.S. Open, setting the U.S. Open single-round scoring record in round one. Justin Thomas will also be teeing it up this week in Detroit. He snapped back into form at the Travelers Championship after achieving his first top-10 since mid-March at the Valspar Championship. Only winner Keegan Bradley made more birdies at the Travelers, as he closed with a 64-62-67 in his final three rounds. Tom Kim will also like his chances this week after he finished T8 at the U.S. Open in Los Angeles. Turning 21 years old last week in Connecticut, he posted rounds of 64 and 65 to finish T38. The Korean debuted here last summer and matched the course record (63) on Sunday to finish solo seventh. Max Homa, Hideki Matsuyama, Collin Morikawa and Keegan Bradley will also be shooting for top spot in Detroit. \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Highlights | Round 4 & Playoff | Rocket Mortgage | 2023","duration":751,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20230702","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWD4Y46_89U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OWD4Y46_89U/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":550324}}

Short and medium-haul jet travel offered unparalleled speed, while the automobile promised unmatched flexibility and convenience. In France, the fastest express trains (Le Mistral) only averaged speeds of just 120km/h.\n\nAlthough French engineers had set remarkable railway speed records during the decade, including reaching 331 km/h in 1955, few considered railways to have much of a future. To compete against newer forms of transport, trains would need faster service speeds. This would require engineering new locomotives, as well as rebuilding rail lines with greater precision, gentler curves, smaller grades and in-cab signaling. The effort and resources required seemed too great to be worthwhile.\n\nOpening in 1964, the Shinkansen was the world‚Äôs first true high-speed railway.  Connecting Japan‚Äôs two largest cities (in the 1960s), Tokyo and Osaka, and travelling at speeds in excess of 120 mph (200 km/h), the new specially-designed Shinkansen trains had the highest service speeds in the world. \n\nWhile the Shinkansen was viewed with admiration around the world, French railway engineers were still world leaders in areas of acceleration, braking, and electric pickup at high speeds. In fact, many of the technologies used on the Shinkansen were pioneered by French railway engineers. \n\nInspired by the Japanese experience, the SNCF began experimental work on a high-speed rail network for France. Called the TGV ( Train √† Grande Vitesse, or \"high-speed train\" in French), they focused on a more cost-effective approach that would leverage existing infrastructure as well as newly developed technologies like gas turbine propulsion. But the road to high-speed rail in France would be fraught with skepticism, opposition and competing visions for the future of transport. \n\nReferences:\n\nJacob Meunier, On the Fast Track.

{"description":"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nBobby Carter | June 30, 2023\n\"WTF is a Tiny Desk and no!\" are the words that led to one of the most publicized journeys any musician has taken to get to NPR headquarters. That was Juvenile's response to Twitter user @theylovemyke's request for him to play a Tiny Desk concert back in April. His response ignited Black Twitter, launching a barrage of tweets and reposts of favorite performances at the Desk, as fans implored the \"T.C. soldier\" to reconsider. His viral reconsideration led to a few DMs, which led to a few phone calls, and the date was set. Juve, like some rappers in his class, had never heard of our little nook in Washington, D.C., but he soon found out.\n\nThe pressure to deliver was palpable in the planning stages but as the band was assembled, my expectations were exceeded. Tiny Desk alumni and New Orleans natives Trombone Shorty and Alvin Ford were brought into the fold. Another Tiny Desk vet from New Orleans, Jon Batiste, flew in from London just to be a part of the set. Juvenile sourced The Amours from right here in D.C. to handle background vocals, along with string players from the Louisiana Philharmonic for the grand finale. The architect of the Juvenile/Cash Money Records sound, DJ Mannie Fresh, became the glue that pieced it all together. The result was one of the most rambunctious experiences at the Desk. The Hot Boy coasted through highlights from a decades-long, groundbreaking career, concluding with a performance of \"Back That Azz Up,\" so exuberant that the audience demanded an encore and the band obliged. A Tiny Desk first.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Intro (feat. Mannie Fresh)\"\n\"400 Degreez (feat. Mannie Fresh)\"\n\"Bling Bling (feat. Mannie Fresh)\"\n\"Ha\"\n\"Set It Off\"\n\"Slow Motion\"\n\"Rodeo (feat.

Thanks to this drone he can press buttons that allow him to open doors, so he finds a hallway with the head of one of the monsters of the school, it is Opila Bird, staring at him. After a puzzle, he finds himself in a room that artificially recreates the environment of an outdoor playground and must complete the most difficult mission, which is to feed eggs to Opila. Once the mission is completed, a door opens and after another puzzle, the father is forced to escape from Opila by doing professional parkour....\n\nGARTEN OF BANBAN 3\nThe game starts with an elevator crash that takes the player to the Ground Level, where Queen Bouncelia's hidden art is found. Banban, who has gone insane, isolates himself in a security room. Stinger Flynn breaches the room and reveals that he knows the whereabouts of the children. To access the cafeteria, the player must deposit oddities or crayons, granting further access. In the Aquatic sector, the player collects batteries to enter a hallway with various species. Flynn wakes up and shows the player his old home and the location of a cannon minigame. In a vision of the past, a hungry Banban searches for the player.\n\nAs Flynn, the player meets Slow Seline, who guides them down the hallway. The player wakes up in Toadster's Jail, containing puzzles and a videotape depicting Sheriff Toadster's donor. In the Medical Sector, Banban explains the creation of Nabnaleena as a solution to mass slaughter. Solving a puzzle correctly grants access to the sound area, while failure results in Nabnaleena attacking. Nabnab and Nabnaleena have a romantic scene interrupted by Jumbo Josh or Stinger Flynn, causing Nabnaleena to flee.\n\nThe player awakens in a room with Banbaleena and Nabnab. The objective is to escape without alerting Jumbo Josh. Unlocking a door leads Banbaleena to follow until the Arboreal Sector. Flynn takes the player to a puzzle area with Chamataki and Tamataki.

{"description":"The 2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S ($ not yet announced) may look quite familiar, but it has seen some significant changes over the outgoing model. Gone is the V8, and in its stead is the most powerful production four-cylinder engine in the world - aided further by electric power. This pumps up the new AMG C63 S to a massive 671 horsepower and 752 lb ft of torque. However it has some serious weight it needs to handle along with all of that power. \n\nThomas and James are eager to share their thoughts after spending over a thousand miles behind the wheel in Europe.

{"description":"Subscribe Now! - https://bit.ly/RenYTSub\nListen to Suic*de: https://found.ee/ren-suic-de\n\nAfter Joe died the visits I paid to North Wales were fleeting. By being somewhere new I could be someone new. Brighton didn't just offer me a new chapter, it offered me a new book, and a whole new character. \n\nOn Monday  I would make the difficult journey home because of music and the fund raising efforts of my incredible following. We managed to raise an incredible ¬£21,000 for the RNLI, an incredible team of volunteers, who risk their lives without pay to aid calls of distress from British shores. The night Joe went missing they were out on the choppy stretch of water between Anglesey and the Mainland, until 5am, looking for Joe, without pay, from the goodness of their hearts. They continued the search efforts for the entire following week until hope dwindled. They owed us nothing, and gave us everything.\n\nYesterday I decided to pay a visit to Joe's mum and dad. I was asked to play them the new live session I recorded in Calgary. It was probably the most nervous I've been playing someone a video that I'd made. The topic isn't an easy one, especially for parents who have lost an incredible son. I nervously hit play, and the gravity of what I was showing sunk in and I began to cry. In the end we sat in silence, silently sobbing. Joes mum turned to me and smiled and we hugged, and I felt much lighter.\n\n It made me really realise I guess what I've always known. Music is far more than music. It's a channel of communication for the things that are impossible to say. It's a bridge between the living and the dead. It's a way to stay immortal. It's a way to resurrect the dead. It's a universal language. It cuts down barriers of the parts of you which are encapsulated in steel cast iron. It allows frozen rivers to thaw and become un-stagnant. I owe myself, my life, everything I am to music. Music is the closest thing to god I know. I am so grateful to be doing what I do and to tap into this mystic force. My life, my energy, myself, I eternally devote to it.\n\nFilmed by Samuel Perry Falvey","title":"Ren - For Joe","duration":290,"channel_id":"UCqq3VcwPGseErHUa0-xLInQ","author":"Ren","date":"20230629","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebX5ZvrT6-o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ebX5ZvrT6-o/hqdefault.webp?v=649d9c1c","content":{"View count":514717}}
