Enjoy the highlights of a magical night at the Santiago Bernab√©u. Carlo Ancelotti's team came from behind to win the derby after falling behind early at the Santiago Bernab√©u and won the match in extra time. √Ålvaro Morata gave Atl√©tico the lead in the first half before Rodrygo's equalizer in the second half caused an eruption of celebrations at the Bernab√©u with a solo goal. Captain Karim Benzema then scored to make it 2-1 at the very end of the first period of extra time, before Vini Jr. added a goal of his own to make it 3-1 and seal the win.\n#CopaDelRey\n\nüé•  SUBSCRIBE \nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\nüì± FOLLOW US \nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\nüí≥ BECOME A MADRIDISTA: https://www.madridistas.com","title":"Real Madrid 3-1 Atl√©tico de Madrid | HIGHLIGHTS | Copa del Rey","duration":104,"channel_id":"UCWV3obpZVGgJ3j9FVhEjF2Q","author":"Real Madrid","date":"20230126","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlPnxmoGnns","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GlPnxmoGnns/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2841085}}

{"description":"Dead Space reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.\n\n\"With its stunningly redesigned spaceship, smartly and subtly enhanced story, and spectacularly reimagined action scenes, Motive Studio has managed to successfully breathe new life into the seminal sci-fi horror universe of Dead Space. Despite the fact I‚Äôve returned to the 2008 original several times over the years and found it to hold up fairly well, my latest journey through the darkened hallways of the USG Ishimura still managed to consistently surprise me and pull me into Isaac‚Äôs plight far more than ever before, while still satisfying my desire to butcher undead astronauts with an enjoyable arsenal of wildly unsafe mining tools. It‚Äôs clear that this superb Dead Space remake has been a labour of love for the team at Motive Studios, who‚Äôve very carefully balanced innovation and renovation with preservation, and to their credit the end result is undoubtedly the definitive way to experience ‚Äì or re-experience ‚Äì one of the best survival horror shooters that Capcom never made.\"","title":"Dead Space Remake Review","duration":630,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230126","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT882yrfSEc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/yT882yrfSEc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":725395}}

{"description":"Nick Wright joins Colin Cowherd after his Kansas City Chiefs successfully secured their spot in yet another AFC Championship. But with Patrick Mahomes suffering with a high ankle sprain, Colin and Nick weigh their chances against the rival Cincinnati Bengals, lead by a quarterback, Joe Burrow, who is 3-0 against Mahomes. Plus, Nick lays out why Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills have been exposed in their loss to Cincinnati in the Divisional round, and lost their right to be considered the Chiefs' rivals. Nick and Colin also talk the future of Dak Prescott, who was eliminated when the Dallas Cowboys lost to Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n#TheHerd #NFL #NFLPlayoffs\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb \n \n‚ñ∫Watch the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/LatestOnTheHerd \n\n‚ñ∂The Carton Show's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n‚ñ∂First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n‚ñ∫UNDISPUTED‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED \n‚ñ∫Speak‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n‚ñ∫FOX Bet Live‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n‚ñ∫Club Shay Shay‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n‚ñ∫The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n‚ñ∫What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from THE HERD: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFoxSports \nLike THE HERD on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFacebook \nFollow THE HERD on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDTwitter \nFollow THE HERD on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDInstagram \n\nFollow Colin Cowherd on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ColinCowherdTwitter \n \nAbout The Herd with Colin Cowherd:\nThe Herd with Colin Cowherd is a three-hour sports television and radio show on FS1 and iHeartRadio.

The series has had two really good episodes back to back and as a big fan of the game I've loved watching these first two entries. They do change some things up though and throughout the video we're gonna be going over the easter eggs, game differences and also giving our thoughts on the series so far.\n\nHuge thank you to everyone who checked out our video last week and like that one we're gonna be saving the more spoilery easter eggs until the end so that people who haven't played the game can enjoy all the twists and turns that come up in the show. I'll give you a heads up before we hit that and we start the episode off in Jakarta all the way back in 2003.\n\nIf you cast your mind back to last week then you may remember that they did an announcement over the radio that talked about the city and how something strange was going on there. Here we see it playing out with the outbreak of the infection being studied by a doctor. This wasn't in the game and I like how the series is slowly filling in the backstory of the virus. Both the beginning of last episode and this one had completely new bits in them and it's possible that we might even get a new story slotted in at the opening of each entry that gives us way more details on the infection than what we ever got in the game.\n\nWhen the title cards first shown we can see this is taking place on September 24th 2003 dating it two days before the outbreak. This of course shows how fast the virus spread and in the game we learned it was through products contain flour and yeast which we'll talk more about in just a bit. Huge shoutouts to Dyanmic Smurf on our last video for pointing out that 2003 was potentially chosen because it was one of the hottest years on record which a record breaking heat wave happening that killed 20,000 people.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 2 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":1737,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230123","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crDFaekrmLE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/crDFaekrmLE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":552841}}
