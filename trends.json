Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! \n\nOn this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. \n\nIf you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.","title":"Rick Shiels Vs Bubbie (Good Good matchplay)","duration":2890,"channel_id":"UCFHZHhZaH7Rc_FOMIzUziJA","author":"Rick Shiels Golf","date":"20220810","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is_gG6cFfQI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Is_gG6cFfQI/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":620258}}

{"description":"Welcome Back ladies and gents to the worst skyrim build ever created! It is perfectly balanced because today we have done todd howard proud by playing skyrim the true way Bethesda intended!  Say hello to the worst underpowered and overpowered character build the world has ever seen. Gone are the days of OP stealth archer Skyrim characters. Say hello to the new negative Armor rating heavy builds that can deal infinite damage upon taking damage but usually can only take 1 hit before they are defeated by a level 1 wolf. We have built perfectly balanced skyrim forks that 1 hit dragons and gods. Whilst building skyrim necromancy characters that can raise an army of the dead. But today we build a noodle that whilst having infinite health will still receive infinite damage. A Perfect Counter. So let us break skyrim together! And provided this video does well I think its time the spiffing brit takes on skyrim multiplayer! \n\nso it's time for me to flex my exploit skills and break the game with infinite armor. My power is unstoppable and I will defeat this impossible challenge with all of my skyrim illegal experience to discover if this game is broken or can you beat perfectly balanced gameplay! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced game series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.

{"description":"Mac Jones is entering his second season in the NFL, after making the playoffs his rookie year. However, his growth may be at question. According to New England Patriots beat writer Mike Giraldi, the QB is 'struggling' more than last summer with changes to the team's offensive staff. Colin Cowherd explains why he is concerned for Jones, along with how Bill Belichick will continue to struggle in his second season without Tom Brady. Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa and New York Giants QB Daniel Jones are entering their first seasons under new head coaches. While both QBs are under pressure this season, which one will have the better year based off of practice footage across social media?
