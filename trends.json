{"description":"NASCAR continued its west coast travels with the Pala Casino 400 as Ross Chastain and Kyle Busch started stage one with a fury! Busch was a strong contender to win the first stage until he suffered a pit-stop penalty which played a role into Busch finishing 12th. Chastain cruised to a comfortable first-place finish. Chastain continued this theme in the second stage where he again finished in first place, followed by Kyle Busch and Joey Logano. However, in the final stage, Busch took it to another level and was able to win the Pala Casino 400. With the victory, Busch holds the all-time record for consecutive cup seasons with a victory at 19 and is now ninth in the all-time victories list.\n\n#NASCARonFOX #NASCAR #Fontana\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫FOX Sports YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n‚ñ∫PBC ON FOX‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n‚ñ∫WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n‚ñ∫FOX Soccer‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n‚ñ∫CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOX\nLike NASCAR on FOX on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXFacebook\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXTwitter\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXInstagram\n\nAbout NASCAR on FOX:\nYour home for NASCAR on FOX, from Raceday to Radioactive and all of the racing action in between.\n\n2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX\nhttps://youtu.be/ZXJyURa1Cww\n\nNASCAR on FOX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/NASCARonFOX","title":"2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX","duration":832,"channel_id":"UCWw4HqQcexuZfeFd4XLrNNg","author":"NASCAR on FOX","date":"20230227","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJyURa1Cww","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXJyURa1Cww/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":228289}}

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents.

He moves to Paris to follow his dream, and with the help of hapless garbage boy Linguini he puts his culinary skills to the test in the kitchen but he has to stay in hiding at the same time, with hilarious consequences. Remy eventually gets the chance to prove his culinary abilities to a great food critic but is the food good?

{"description":"Hey guys! Today I attempt to \"Fix The Unfixable\" squishies in my collection. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my \"hopeless bin\" and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!\n\nDON'T FORGET TO GET THE ME PLAYING CARDS:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/p/7422520721599\n\n*available only until March 20th*\n\n________FAQs_________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ‚ñ∫https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ‚ñ∫https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"1 Million Subscribers!

Pre-order or buy through April 27 and get the Outdoor Playtime Digital Content**! (This content will become available when the pack launches.) \n \nFamily is at the center of a lot of the choices and milestones your Sim will be faced with in the Growing Together Expansion Pack. For example ‚Äì will they let their parents move in with them? Saying ‚Äòno‚Äô will impact those relationships and saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô could make life at home a lot more complicated. What if your Sim‚Äôs parents don‚Äôt get along with their partner? For you, the choice might be whether you want to keep the peace or stir up some drama. \n \nNew relationships are getting more dynamic too. If your Sim goes out to meet new people, they might find someone they instantly like who they could be friends with for life. Or they could meet a lifelong enemy. Social chemistry will make some Sims click and some Sims clash, and how they navigate these feelings is up to you. \n \nAvailable March 16 at 10 a.m. PT on Origin PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation¬Æ4, and PlayStation¬Æ5 \n \nPre-order today and get ready to enjoy some family fun (with a side of disfunction): https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-growing-together \n \n*Requires The Sims 4 & all game updates.
