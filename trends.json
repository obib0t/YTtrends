{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to our next installment of our nordic/Scandinavian travel trip! After taking a warm bath in the Blue Lagoon in Iceland - I thought - let’s chill out a bit - literally - and head to the original Ice Hotel in Northern Sweden! Yes, this hotel is made completely out of ice and snow, and it melts and gets rebuilt every year - and yes, people actually sleep in here!! I'm very interested by **strange hotels** and after our trip to the Underwater Hotel last year, when I heard of the ICEHOTEL - I figured, we better check it out. So, after a brief moment being stuck in Iceland, we headed to the ICEHOTEL to investigate & spend the night - and hopefully not get cryogenically frozen like Walt Disney's head.

Thanks to AG1 for sponsoring Click here: https://athleticgreens.com/tylerandtodd to get up to a year's supply of immune supporting Vitamin D + 5 individual travel packs, both FREE with your first purchase! \n\nThe idea to build a shipping container home was definitely one of the wildest ones we've had and if you've been joining our weekly videos for any amount of time you know that's saying something. It feels absolutely incredible that the container home FINALLY has a consistent and reliable source of heat...just in time for the holidays!

Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01SSGRLDNS2I5","title":"Build a Shipping Container Home they said...","duration":1526,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20230507","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksDaL45rsQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uksDaL45rsQ/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":151275}}

{"description":"Long Live the Fighters. #DunePartTwo only in theaters November 3.\n\n-----------------\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dune\nhttps://twitter.com/dunemovie \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@dunemovie \n-----------------\nThe saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast.  The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).\n“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. \nVilleneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel.  The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick.  The executive producers are Josh Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.\nVilleneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West.  Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.\n“Dune: Part Two” was filmed on location in Budapest, Abu Dhabi, Jordan and Italy.  The film is slated for a November 3, 2023 worldwide release from Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Dune: Part Two | Official Trailer","duration":144,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

Then finally I recycled old slag to see if it would produce any more iron.\n\nThe first way was to roast the ore before smelting. This drove off the moisture and volatiles in the ore as well as burning off any sulfur present. The resulting ore produced a higher yield of iron than normal (33g iron as opposed to about 15g iron as usual for the same volume of ore, charcoal and time). \n\nNext lime was added to the smelt as a flux in the form of snail shells. The theory was that the lime would lower the melting point of any silica in the ore to make a runnier slag and help the iron come together more. The result was very bad, no iron was produced apart from 1 or 2 prills. I suspect the ore is already basic in chemistry and adding a basic flux in the form of lime made it so basic that the slag was too viscous. The ore probably won't benefit from a basic flux but might benefit from an acid flux such as sand or slag from previous smelts.\n\nNext I tried smelting slag from previous smelts to see if anymore iron would come out. It did surprisingly, less than fresh ore but still worth doing. For this reason it might be useful to add old slag as a flux to future smelts to help the slag form more easily, while contributing some more iron to the smelt.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

The TNT was unforgiving. Grian and I tried our best to fix it and give him a gift. I can't believe this happened!!

{"description":"The 2023 MET Gala has come and gone, and well I wish it had gone rather faster, considering the lack of care or interest most of the celebrities put into it. The MET Gala exhibit “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” was celebrated with a red carpet attended by the world of celebrity and fashion’s elite. But the theme of the red carpet “In honor of Karl” was certainly followed loosely. Celebrities arrived wearing poor imitations of Karl Lagerfeld’s work at Chanel, while neglecting his work at Fendi, Patou, Balmain, and Chloé so severely it was almost sickening. What was supposed to be an exciting and easy theme to follow, was obviously just too hard. \n\nMET Gala 2023 Karl Lagerfeld Theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrFvY8KczIM\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:09 Anna Wintour & Bill Nighy - Chanel\n2:25 Anne Hathaway - Versace\n3:49 Bad Bunny - Jacquemus\n5:13 Billie Eilish - Simone Rocha\n6:55 Cardi B - Chen Peng\n8:26 Doja Cat - Oscar de la Renta\n10:36 Dua Lipa - Chanel\n12:42 Emma Chamberlain - Miu Miu\n14:03 Gigi Hadid - Givenchy\n15:10 Ice Spice - Balmain \n17:00 Janelle Monae - Thom Browne\n18:49 Jared Leto\n18:55 Jenna Ortega - Thom Browne\n20:43 Jennie Kim - Chanel\n22:34 Kendall Jenner - Marc Jacobs\n23:39 Kim Kardashian - Schiaparelli\n25:13 Kylie Jenner - Jean Paul Gaultier by Haider Ackermann\n26:13 Lil Nas X - Pat McGrath\n27:45 Lizzo - Chanel\n28:51 Margot Robbie - Chanel\n29:50 Michaela Coel - Schiaparelli\n32:02 Nicole Kidman - Chanel\n33:16 Rihanna & A$AP Rocky\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join\n\nSocial Media:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/\nPersonal Style: https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hautelemode\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess\n\nFor business inquiries please contact: hautelemode@whalartalent.com\n\nVideo Edited by:\nRachel Fritz: https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/","title":"THE MET GALA SUCKED (2023 Met Gala Fashion Roast)","duration":2178,"channel_id":"UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw","author":"HauteLeMode","date":"20230502","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WcvAiKQfI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E_WcvAiKQfI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGGUgZShlMA8=&rs=AOn4CLAlFshG7dMAZ4UJVyLKa8hKzbNxsA","content":{"View count":661744}}
