{"description":"The Sanibel Causeway was rendered completely impassable to vehicles. Less than a month later, it was open to traffic.\nCheck out the Practical Engineering store: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nWatch on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-how-this-bridge-was-rebuilt-in-15-days-after-hurricane-ian\n\nErrata: (None yet)\n\nBoth Florida DOT and Superior Construction were contacted for comment on this story. FDOT declined to comment, and Superior Construction did not respond to multiple emails.\n\nBarrier islands are critical to protecting mainland coasts by absorbing wave energy and bearing the brunt of storms. But development on the islands negates that critical purpose. That doesn’t mean the community doesn’t belong there. But it does obligate the planners and engineers involved in rebuilding to be thoughtful about the impacts hurricanes can have and how infrastructure can be made more resilient to them in the future.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"A major winter storm is expected to develop in the days leading up to Christmas. Behind the storm a massive chunk of Arctic air will plunge into the lower 48 giving some the coldest air they have felt in years. Travel could be significantly impacted for the holiday.\n\nThe highest impacts when it comes to the snow will be in the Great Lakes Region and Midwest.\n\nSome places, especially along and around the Great Lakes could pick up more than a foot. Areas in parts of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin could see near-blizzard conditions as the storm gets stronger Thursday night into Friday.\n\nThings quiet down for Christmas Eve, but the chill settles in all the way down to Florida. Miami could fall into the 30s and Orlando could dip below freezing.\n\nThe only place to escape the Arctic chill is the Desert Southwest and Southern California. Or The Caribbean :)\n\nSubscribe to @News6WKMG for more updates!","title":"UPDATE!

{"description":"Argentines celebrate on Sunday that their hero Lionel Messi’s once-in-a-generation career is complete. The Argentina superstar is finally a World Cup champion.\n\nMessi scored two goals and then another in a shootout as Argentina beat France 4-2 on penalties Sunday to claim a third World Cup title despite Kylian Mbappé scoring the first hat trick in a final in 56 years.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, fans cheered, cried, hugged and waved the Argentina flag as they gathered to watch the match.\n\nMessi is definitively in the pantheon of soccer’s greatest ever players, alongside Pelé — a record three-time World Cup champion from Brazil — and Diego Maradona, the late Argentina great with whom Messi was so often compared.\n\nMessi has achieved what Maradona did in 1986, dominate a World Cup for Argentina.\n\nMessi put Argentina ahead from the penalty spot and played a part in Angel Di Maria’s goal that made it 2-0 after 36 minutes.\n\nMbappé scored two goals in a 97-second span to take the game to extra time, and then Messi tapped in his second goal in the 109th minute. But there was still time for another penalty from Mbappé to take the thrilling game to a shootout.\n\nPlease subscribe, like the video and share wherever you can!\n\nHelp support the channel from only £0.99p a month!!\nGet special loyalty badges next to your name in the comments and live chat!

{"description":"Today, I'm getting back surgery to remove a large tumor near my tailbone. It'll be a difficult procedure as the tumor is inside the spinal column and is surrounded by many nerves. Surgeons will have to make it through multiple bones to get in there and remove as much of it as possible. We then have to wait for biopsy results to figure out how to handle all the remaining tumors (I have a total of eight in my spine). It is looking most like I'll be needing radiation therapy as well as chemotherapy. \n\nThey believe what I have is something called Myxopapillary Ependymoma (MEPN). From what I'm researching online, it seems about one in a million people get this. It seems to be growing from the central nervous system out of the spinal cord rather than the brain, in my case. \n\nOver the last 18 months or longer, I've been experiencing an incredible amount of pain in my tailbone, hamstrings, calve muscles, lower back, and gluteus muscles. It is particularly painful when trying to do physical activity such as jumping, running, jogging, and even walking. It feels like a knife is being stabbed up into my tailbone area. So, it's been pretty painful filming my YouTube videos for a while now. This is why I haven't been doing as many martial arts and other fun and crazy physical challenges lately. Hopefully, after this surgery I'll be able to get back to normal life and doing all the fun things I used to do.\n\nThanks to all of you who have been super supportive and positive throughout this. I really appreciate it. Also, thank you to everybody at Keck Medicine at USC in Los Angeles, CA. Every single person I spent time with, surgeons, nurses, physical therapists, doctors, MRI technicians, etc... everybody was super positive and just had a really good attitude despite having a very difficult job. \n\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.

It's also scary on TikTok because it's not obvious when videos are ads here. That TikTok featuring a \"real\" person in their bedroom talking about how great a product is for their medical condition might not be \"real\" at all, but a careful crafted advertisement designed to trick you into thinking these products work. Today we talk about EMF shields, double chin sucking devices, alkaline water machines, ear cleaners, posture correctors,  mastic chewing gum, coffee enemas, ionic foot detox, and more! Let me know down below if there are more products you've seen that you'd like me to review.\n\n00:00 - EMF Shield\n02:12 - Double Chin Remover\n03:38 - Alkaline Water Machine\n05:12 - Ear Cleaners\n06:46 - Posture Correctors\n07:49 - Mastic Chewing Gum\n09:28 - Coffee Enemas\n11:04 - Ionic Food Detox\n\nHelp us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!

After finishing in second place at last year’s championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods will return for a third consecutive year, hoping to earn their first win. 2021 winners John Daly and his son, University of Arkansas sophomore John Daly II, will be back in action after securing a two-shot win last time out and will be looking to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. Four-time winners Bernhard Langer and his son, Jason, return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, for the first time since 2020, while Justin Thomas and his dad, Mike, will be eager to continue their good run of form at the event which saw them claim victory in 2020 and a third-place finish in 2021. LPGA Tour star and Olympic gold medallist Nelly Korda will once again be partnering with her father, Petr, a former professional tennis player who claimed a Grand Slam victory at the 1998 Australian Open.  \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Tiger and Charlie Woods shoot 13-under 59 | Round 1 | PNC Championship | 2022","duration":394,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20221218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIKatrlcA0g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/bIKatrlcA0g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":689445}}

Be wary when traveling on foot, or switching the track's direction; Charles might be waiting for you.\nUpgrade your train to fit your needs.\n\nGo looting or complete missions to find \"Scraps\", which can be used to turn your train into a death machine on wheels.\nGet help from the townspeople.\n\nHelp out the settlers in return for high powered weapons, and other items vital to Charles' destruction.\nFight Charles to the death.\n\nComplete the main questline, and summon Charles to a mortal duel. If you’ve gained enough strength, firepower, and skill, Charles may finally meet his match.\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain.

{"description":"Amy and Sonic, Sonic and Amy, Sonamy: Amy Rose doesn’t care what you call them, as long as you recognise that the Blue Blur and her are destined to be together. Although, somebody should probably tell Sonic the Hedgehog, because he doesn’t seem interested in giving Ms Rose a new surname (which I guess would make her Amy the Hedgehog… or Mrs. Sonic Hedgehog?... ANYWAY…). Looking to make her dream a reality, Amy turns to Tails for help. That was her first mistake. It was supposed to be Sonic and Amy Rose, not Sonic vs Amy Rose. That’s what everybody wanted… except for Miles Prower, of course. \n\nWhy rewatch the Sonic movie, when you’ve got a perfectly good Amy Rose movie right here.

LPGA Tour star and Olympic gold medallist Nelly Korda will once again be partnering with her father, Petr, a former professional tennis player who claimed a Grand Slam victory at the 1998 Australian Open. \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Tiger Woods gives son Charlie INSTANT feedback on his swing","duration":141,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20221216","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lfEJyxDwYk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6lfEJyxDwYk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":543714}}

{"description":"Jason Cammisa got the exclusive first test, strapped on his equipment, and broke the record: the Lucid Air Sapphire is the world's quickest-accelerating production car.\n\nWith a staggering quarter-mile performance of 9.1 seconds at 156 mph, this 1200+ horsepower 3-motor Air beat out the reigning champion, the triple-motor, 1020-hp Tesla Model S Plaid, which runs the 1/4-mile in 9.3 seconds at 152 mph.\n\nThe cars are \"tied\" at 2.1 seconds 0-60, though some trivia: the Lucid Air Sapphire gets to 60 mph 0.03 seconds before the Tesla Model S Plaid.\n\nWe weren't satisfied with just that race, so we also brought along the fastest-accelerating gas-powered production car, the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport. This is the 1479-hp (1500-PS) Chiron with shortened gear ratios, grippy Michelin Cup 2R tires, a fixed rear wing, and weight-reduction measures. \n\nEven despite these hyper-aggressive Michelins' distaste for cold tarmac, the Chiron ripped off a 2.3-second, four-wheel-burnout launch from 0-to-60 mph, and then continued on to a 9.3-second, 156-mph quarter-mile performance. That is a tenth quicker to 60 mph than the \"regular\" Chiron has managed, and a tenth quicker through the quarter, too. That's an internal-combustion production-car 1/4-mile record for the Chiron Pur Sport — and we suspect that, in warmer conditions, this Pur Sport would be even quicker! \n\nThat's not the case with the 210-hp Ducati Panigale V4 SP2, one of the quickest superbikes in the world. It had no traction issues as MotoAmerica Supersport champion rider Josh Herrin cracked the throttle wide open, dumped the dry clutch, and ripped off a stupefying 9.3-second, 157-mph run through the quarter-mile.\n\nThis beat our last outing with the same Panigale, when it handily dusted a 2023 C8 Corvette Z06. This time, Ducati softened the suspension and dropped the fork; Josh sacrificed the clutch and kept the wheelie at bay. It's safe to say this is the limit for the SP2 — except that Ducati offers a factory Akrapovic exhaust and tune that boost horsepower. We'd love to come back and try that again!\n\nBut for the moment, it's clear: among production cars with four wheels, the Lucid Air Sapphire is now the acceleration king, with the Chiron Pur Sport in second place. In one video, Tesla went from first to third.\n\nMay the fight continue.\n\nThis episode of Ultimate Drag Race Replay is brought to you by WeatherTech: https://www.weathertech.com/?utm_source=hagerty&utm_medium=web_visit&utm_campaign=Ultimate_Drag_Race_Replay\n\n\n===\n\n0:00 Introducing Lucid Air Sapphire, Tesla Model S Plaid, Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport, and the Ducati Panigale V4 SP2\n0:56 German 155-mph Autobahn Gentleman's Agreement - within 1/4 mile\n1:29 Tesla Model S Plaid vs E39 M5\n2:04 Lucid Air Sapphire Prototype\n2:30 Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport\n3:13 Main Event: Drag Race Sapphire vs Plaid vs Chiron!\n3:55 Walkback: Sapphire Drag Race explanation\n4:18 Why is Sapphire so much quicker than Air Dream Edition?\n5:05 Tesla Plaid in Last Place\n5:49 Bugatti Chiron Launch Control is violent\n6:00 EV vs ICE traction control: The 1000-Hz advantage\n7:07 Josh Herrin in the Ducati Panigale V4 SP2\n7:35 Bonus Race: Ducati Panigale V4 SP2 vs Lucid Air Sapphire\n8:24 The Ducati's quarter-mile-long wheelie\n9:03 Overall Drag Race Results — Rimac & Bugatti join forces\n\n==\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

{"description":"Welcome to what could be our most exciting review EVER! \n\nMat’s got his hands on the McMurtry Spéirling, and he’s about to find out if it can back up its claim of being the quickest accelerating road car ever made! \n\nNow before he even gets behind the wheel, you need to know that the McMurtry comes with a reputation! It's claimed the record as being the fastest car to complete the Goodwood Festival of Speed Hillclimb - beating an F1 car to the title by two whole seconds!\n\nBut what makes this lightning-fast single-seater so special? Well, it comes with an incredible fan system that helps to generate 2,000kg of downforce! This means the McMurtry is not only super quick off the line, but it can take corners at speed with ease. \n\nIn terms of power output, it has two electric motors that produce 1,000hp. Now you may not think that’s too impressive, given EVs such as the Rimac Nevera come with almost 2,000hp. However, whereas the Nevera weighs over 2 tonnes, the McMurtry Spéirling weighs less than one tonne!! \n\nNow, of course, all that power and performance doesn’t come cheap, costing just under £2,000,000. But if the car can break records as it claims, then it’s got to be worth it, right? \n\nAll we know is, this is one review you don’t want to miss! Will Mat go faster than he’s ever been before? And more importantly, will he break some records?! There’s only one way to find out… Join us for this ultra-in-depth review and see for yourself!\n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n00:44 McMurtry Overview\n03:03 Exterior Design\n04:12 Fan System\n06:26 Interior\n13:11 Annoying Features\n14:21 Cool Features\n16:26 0-60mph & 1/4-mile: Attempt #1\n1945 0-60mph & 1/4-mile: Attempt #2","title":"I broke the 1/4-mile world record in this new HYPERCAR!","duration":1575,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20221215","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TptzkkbC1vE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/TptzkkbC1vE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3668327}}
