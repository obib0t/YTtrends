{"description":"üößThings are getting messyüöß\n\nDisney and Pixar's #InsideOut2 is coming to theaters June 2024 with brand new emotions!\n\nThe little voices inside Riley‚Äôs head know her inside and out‚Äîbut next summer, everything changes when Disney and Pixar‚Äôs ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù introduces a new Emotion: Anxiety. According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. ‚ÄúAnxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she‚Äôs not really the type to take a back seat,‚Äù said Mann. ‚ÄúThat makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.‚Äù A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar‚Äôs ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who‚Äôve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren‚Äôt sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she‚Äôs not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù releases only in theaters Summer 2024.","title":"Inside Out 2 | Teaser Trailer","duration":90,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20231109","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWavstJydZU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VWavstJydZU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":6147898}}

We also now know how this sets up the future of the MCu and a rough idea of where it could all be going for the upcoming films. I won't be covering The Marvels ending incase you haven't seen it but later on we might give some theories for Deadpool 3 and Avengers Secret Wars.\n\nThat will all be at the end of the video though and last week saw Loki getting the band back together to travel back to the loom in order to stop it from self destructing.\n\nThat takes us into this episode in which we get a lot of major revelations. For that final time I'm gonna need you to hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe because we still have a lot of comic content coming soon. With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into The Loki Season 2 Finale.\n\n-\n\nNow as always we begin with the marvel studios logo however here somethings different.

Craft the everyday food, fuel, weapons, ammo and space suit upgrades you‚Äôll need to survive out here in the vastness of the cosmos.\n\nIn space there is no up or down! Expand your base in any direction for the most efficient layout. Once you are equipped with the necessary fuel and a warp drive, you‚Äôll be free to explore other sectors and continue your mission.\n\nCircumnavigate tiny asteroids, fly between abandoned outposts, and board derelict spaceships as they orbit the system. Take caution, however, and remember to keep your jetpack fuel topped up‚Äìyou‚Äôll need it to get back to your Space Rig safe and sound!\n\nEach salvage zone is a procedurally generated, dynamic, and ever-changing open world.\n\nYou are an employee for the galaxy‚Äôs number one waste disposal firm, stranded far away from home with a mission to clean the galaxy from the remains of a galactic war.Space trash is your main resource. Whether it is salvaged debris floating in space, advanced and rare tech from wrecked ships, or scavenged goods from asteroid surfaces, you‚Äôll want to snatch it all up!\n\nRecycle and refine it to produce valuable goods that will net a tidy sum on the Trash Exchange, and spend it to upgrade your kit.\n\nYou‚Äôre not alone amid the wreckage. Alien bots patrol most sectors of space nowadays and they‚Äôll be drawn to you as your operation expands.\n\nYou‚Äôll need a steady aim, impeccable defenses, and an upgraded armory to protect your Space Rig from the dangers of these foes. Survival depends on your ability to defend yourself!\n\n...and more!\nWe'll be adding more and more to Space Trash Scavenger, so be sure to wishlist and follow for updates!

{"description":"128 seconds of Masters of the Air. The 9-part series event premieres January 26. https://apple.co/_MastersOfTheAir\n\nFrom Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman - the producers of Band of Brothers and The Pacific. During World War II, airmen risk their lives with the 100th Bomb Group, a brotherhood forged by courage, loss, and triumph.\n\nBased on Donald L. Miller‚Äôs book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff, ‚ÄúMasters of the Air‚Äù follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the ‚ÄúBloody Hundredth‚Äù) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler‚Äôs Third Reich, is at the heart of ‚ÄúMasters of the Air.‚Äù Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.\n\nThe series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle and Nate Mann, who are joined by Raff Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, \"Masters of the Air\" is executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Television, and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman for Playtone. Amblin Television‚Äôs Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey co-executive produce alongside Playtone‚Äôs Steven Shareshian. In addition to writing, Orloff co-executive produces. Graham Yost also serves as co-executive producer. Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees and Tim Van Patten serve as directors.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

Can narcissistic people change?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright react to a Disney experimental era classic, The Emperor's New Groove.

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 Biking Across America\n01:14 day 8: girls‚Äô first flat\n10:53 day 9: guys‚Äô leotards\n25:26 day 11: Nate‚Äôs knee..\n32:04 day 12: 1,000 miles in!\n40:58 bloops","title":"Biking Across America (part 3)","duration":2531,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20231105","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiWJ30qS-Ug","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZiWJ30qS-Ug/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":811038}}

{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John‚Äôs vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles‚Äô endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Peter Jackson\nVideo Producers: Peter Jackson, Clare Olssen, Jonathan Clyde\nAudio Producers: Paul McCartney and Giles Martin\nProduction Company: WingNut Films Productions Ltd\n\nOrder/Listen to Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nOrder/Listen to Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists \nSubscribe to The Beatles‚Äô YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup \nSign up for The Beatles‚Äô Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   \n\nStream The Beatles: \nüéôÔ∏è Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic \nüéôÔ∏è Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify \nüéôÔ∏è Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic \nüéôÔ∏è Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora \nüéôÔ∏è Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal \nüéôÔ∏è Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer \nüéôÔ∏è YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   \n\nFollow The Beatles:  \n‚≠ê https://www.thebeatles.com \n‚≠ê https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"The Beatles - Now And Then (Official Music Video)","duration":275,"channel_id":"UC4dqLAF7yT-_DqeYisQ001w","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231103","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opxhh9Oh3rg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Opxhh9Oh3rg/hqdefault.jpg?v=6544f101","content":{"View count":25642265}}
