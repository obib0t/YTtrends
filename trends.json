To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMB01F5ZJCRFJBFO","title":"We Left for a Cabin in the Woods","duration":1325,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQGWIkKB8l8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JQGWIkKB8l8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":124438}}

Witness water roaring into basements, stranded vehicles, and impassable roads that brought the Big Apple to a standstill.\n\nThis video dives deep into the heart of the devastation, spotlighting the worst affected regions like Brooklyn and Long Island. From shattered rainfall records to streets that became rivers, experience the magnitude of NYC's epic flood crisis.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 $8k per night villa!\n01:27 Royal Villa tour\n02:00 how did we get here?\n03:04 full resort tour: Conrad Bora Bora\n09:00 Kardashian’s stayed here!\n12:18 swimming with manta rays\n16:30 Presidential Villa tour!!🙌🏻\n25:00 Nate attempts to win 5 free nights😍\n27:45 Bloops","title":"We Stayed in Bora Bora's Most Expensive Overwater Villa","duration":1738,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDIp0Vu9iII","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NDIp0Vu9iII/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":760858}}

{"description":"Stephen Thompson | September 29, 2023\nWhat you've got here is a perfect 20-minute distillation of The Sam Smith Experience: The Grammy-winning 2014 ballad that kicked off the singer's career (\"Stay With Me\"), a sleek dance-pop banger (\"How Do You Sleep\") and a chart-topping dollop of debauched hedonism (\"Unholy\") bundled together with \"Lay Me Down,\" in which Smith performed a gorgeous duet with LaDonna Harley-Peters. From the stately to the louche and bawdy — Smith even introduced \"Unholy\" with a perfect summation of their recent artistic direction: \"Let's get saucy!\" — it's all here.\n\nPerforming with an 11-person choir and two instrumentalists — sadly, Kim Petras wasn't there to emerge from between Smith's legs as if she were being birthed — Smith brought an overflowing bag of tricks to the proceedings. But what really shone through was a sense of movement: Each song swayed and played effervescently, centering Smith while also elevating every other magnificent voice in support. This set may not serve as anyone's introduction to the music of Sam Smith, but it's still a hell of a gateway — and a joy to behold.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Stay With Me\"\n\"How Do You Sleep\"\n\"Lay Me Down (feat.

I'm praying this reaches everyone who need it and uplifts those who feel the weight of the world crushing them. I believe in this one.

{"description":"Don’t let the cat out of the bag. #ArgylleMovie, in theaters February 2, 2024.\n\nArgylle\nOnly In Theaters February 2\nhttps://www.argyllemovie.com/\n\n---\nThe greater the spy, the bigger the lie.\n \nFrom the twisted mind of Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman franchise, Kick-Ass) comes Argylle, a razor-witted, reality-bending, globe-encircling spy thriller.\n \nBryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World franchise) is Elly Conway, the reclusive author of a series of best-selling espionage novels, whose idea of bliss is a night at home with her computer and her cat, Alfie. But when the plots of Elly’s fictional books—which center on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate—begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.\n \nAccompanied by Aiden (Oscar® winner Sam Rockwell), a cat-allergic spy, Elly (carrying Alfie in her backpack) races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between Elly’s fictional world and her real one begins to blur.\n \nThe top-flight ensemble cast features Henry Cavill (The Witcher), John Cena (Fast X), Oscar® winner Ariana DeBose (West Side Story), Grammy winning pop superstar Dua Lipa (Barbie), Emmy winner and Oscar® nominee Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Emmy winner and comedy icon Catherine O’Hara (Schitt’s Creek), Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service), and the legendary Samuel L. Jackson. Alfie is played by Chip, the real-life cat of supermodel Claudia Vaughn (née Schiffer).\n \nArgylle is directed and produced by Matthew Vaughn, from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs (Wonder Woman). The film is produced by Matthew Vaughn, Adam Bohling (Kingsman franchise), Jason Fuchs, and David Reid (Kingsman franchise). The executive producers are Adam Fishbach, Zygi Kamasa, Carlos Peres and Claudia Vaughn.\n \nApple Original Films presents, in association with MARV, a Cloudy production. Argylle is distributed by Universal Pictures.","title":"Argylle | Official Trailer","duration":159,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230928","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mgu9mNZ8Hk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7mgu9mNZ8Hk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":13032001}}

{"description":"92 %ers, and probably a lot of you entering your “football era”, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Accelerator Active Energy! \n\nIn this episode, we break down the Eagles' dominant win on Monday Night Football, how much better this Eagles D-line might be than last year and the right time to go for the hurdle. \n\nWe also recap the most talked about 30-point win in the history of the NFL, the Chiefs' big win against the Bears. We’ll get to why the Chiefs offense is finally clicking, Big Red’s career milestone, and we finally talk about it, Taylor Swift paid a visit to the Chiefs Kingdom. \n\nAlso, we answer some not-dumb football questions from the Swifties, try and figure out just how the Dolphins dropped 70 on the Broncos, and let you know if we would have kicked the record-breaking field goal. \n\nThis Friday we will be dropping our incredible episode with The Chiefs Chris “Stone Cold” Jones! The guys talk about everything from his new contract, his wardrobe malfunction at the combines, what he likes least about offensive linemen, and why he wants to get lined up against Tyreek Hill. \n\nMake sure you’re subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don’t miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nACCELERATOR ACTIVE ENERGY: Available nationwide at Target or visit https://ashoc.com/ to find the store nearest you.  \n\nSTATE FARM: https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/multiline or talk to a State Farm agent today to learn how you can bundle and save with the Personal Price Plan.

{"description":"Walkers, \n\nEarlier this year, @Vikkstar123 and I decided to go to the studio together – we started on a new version of the 90s hit \"Better Off Alone\" by @alicedj Little did I know what awaited me when we decided to release this track just a few weeks ago.\n\nIn recent weeks, we've not only worked on giving a new life into this iconic melody but also had the opportunity to collaborate with the original producers of \"Better Off Alone,\" Seb & Eelke, who are also the masterminds behind theTrance project @dashberlin They've introduced us to their new frontman, Ryan, and together, we've recorded the track, filmed a music video, and had some fantastic days of planning and promotion in Oslo. Along the way, I've even been hunted by a crazy cat smurf who seemed to be following me around, but now we're finally ready to share the song and music video with all of you.\n\nYou all know how much I value collaboration and the magic that happens when people come together to make music and share experiences. Being a part of this journey has been an absolute honor. I've learned a lot from the legends behind Dash Berlin and watched Vikk as he released his first official song.I want to say a big thank you for being a part of my journey.

{"description":"Be careful what you wish for ⭐️ Watch the NEW trailer for Disney's #Wish, coming only to theaters this Thanksgiving. \n\nRevealed today are additional members of the film’s voice cast, who join previously announced cast members Ariana DeBose, who voices 17-year-old heroine Asha; Chris Pine, who lends his voice to the formidable King Magnifico; and Alan Tudyk, who provides the memorable voice of Asha’s pet goat, Valentino. \n\nCast members include:\nAngelique Cabral as Queen Amaya, the wife and sounding board of King Magnifico; Victor Garber as Asha’s grandfather, Sabino, who—at 100 years old—is patiently waiting for his wish to be granted; and Natasha Rothwell as Asha’s loving and supportive mom, Sakina.\n \nPlus, Asha’s tight-knit group of confidants, protectors and forever friends: Jennifer Kumiyama as Asha’s dearest friend, Dahlia, who’s an accomplished baker and unofficial leader of their group; Evan Peters as the strong guy with a big heart and bigger yawn, Simon; Harvey Guillén as Gabo, who may be cynical, but he has a heart of gold; Ramy Youssef as Safi, who’s plagued by allergies; Niko Vargas as Asha’s joyful, always smiling buddy, Hal; Della Saba as the seemingly shy teenager, Bazeema, who’s full of surprises; and Jon Rudnitsky as Asha’s rosy-cheeked, wiggly-eared pal, Dario.\n \nABOUT THE MOVIE\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios’ “Wish” is an all-new musical-comedy welcoming audiences to the magical kingdom of Rosas, where Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe—the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico—to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Featuring the voices of Academy Award®-winning actor Ariana DeBose as Asha, Chris Pine as Magnifico, and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino, the film is helmed by Oscar®-winning director Chris Buck (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), and produced by Peter Del Vecho (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Juan Pablo Reyes Lancaster Jones (“Encanto”). Jennifer Lee (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) executive produces—Lee and Allison Moore (“Night Sky,” “Manhunt”) are writers on the project. With original songs by Grammy®-nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer/songwriter/musician Benjamin Rice, plus score by composer Dave Metzger, “Wish” opens only in theaters on Nov. 22, 2023. \n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneywishmovie/ / https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\n\nHashtag: #Wish","title":"Wish | Official Trailer","duration":142,"channel_id":"UC_976xMxPgzIa290Hqtk-9g","author":"Walt Disney Animation Studios","date":"20230927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyRxxpD3yNw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oyRxxpD3yNw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5327799}}
