{"description":"Ferrari once said it would never build an SUV. So what does that make this four-wheel drive newcomer: the Purosangue? In Ferrari‚Äôs words, it‚Äôs not an SUV or a crossover ‚Äì it‚Äôs a sports car. The first four-door four-seater in Maranello‚Äôs history, standing 1,589mm tall. A Range Rover will tower over this like an oak tree.\n \nThanks to a 6.5-litre naturally aspirated V12 mounted behind the front axle under that enormous clamshell bonnet, you‚Äôve got a titanic 715bhp and 528lb ft to enjoy on your way to 8,250rpm. Ferrari says the definitely-not-an-SUV can hit 62mph from rest in 3.3 seconds, scorch from 0-124mph in just 10.6 seconds and top out beyond 192mph. Performance-wise, it‚Äôs a supercar.\n \nSo, is the ‚Äòthoroughbred‚Äô another cash-grab-SUV, or the next smash-hit in Ferrari‚Äôs recent form of sensational road cars? Join Top Gear magazine‚Äôs Ollie Kew for a detailed tour around the looks, under the bonnet and inside the most controversial prancing horse ever made‚Ä¶\n\nMORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:\nWant to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?

{"description":"Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nShe became Queen in 1952 at the age of 25 and spent 70 years on the throne. She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \"it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \"rock\".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign.","title":"Queen Elizabeth II dies aged 96","duration":1369,"channel_id":"UCTrQ7HXWRRxr7OsOtodr2_w","author":"Channel 4 News","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYGByWrjyFw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mYGByWrjyFw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5978592}}

{"description":"Out of the sea, wish I could be... part of that world.\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall‚Äôs live-action reimagining of the studio‚Äôs Oscar¬Æ-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton‚Äôs daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life ‚Äì and her father‚Äôs crown ‚Äì in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (‚Äúgrown-ish‚Äù) as Ariel; Tony Award¬Æ winner Daveed Diggs (‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù ‚ÄúSnowpiercer‚Äù) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (‚ÄúLuca,‚Äù ‚ÄúRoom‚Äù) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (‚ÄúRaya and the Last Dragon‚Äù) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (‚ÄúA Dog‚Äôs Way Home‚Äù) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (‚ÄúHomeland‚Äù) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù) as Queen Selina; with Oscar¬Æ winner Javier Bardem (‚ÄúNo Country for Old Men,‚Äù ‚ÄúBeing the Ricardos‚Äù) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award¬Æ nominee Melissa McCarthy (‚ÄúCan You Ever Forgive Me?‚Äù ‚ÄúBridesmaids‚Äù) as Ursula.      \n\n‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù is directed by Oscar¬Æ nominee Rob Marshall (‚ÄúChicago,‚Äù ‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (‚ÄúLife of Pi,‚Äù ‚ÄúFinding Neverland‚Äù), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (‚ÄúTony Bennett: An American Classic‚Äù), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy¬Æ winner Marc Platt (‚ÄúJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,‚Äù ‚ÄúGrease Live!‚Äù), three-time Tony Award¬Æ winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award¬Æ winner Alan Menken (‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin‚Äù), who won two Oscars¬Æ for the music in the animated version of ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns,‚Äù ‚ÄúInto the Woods‚Äù).

{"description":"The magical teaser trailer for the all-new live-action musical comedy ‚ÄúDisenchanted,‚Äù which premiered at the D23 Expo 2022 in the Anaheim Convention Center moments ago, is here! The eagerly-anticipated sequel to ‚ÄúEnchanted,‚Äù which reunites original cast members Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel, and James Marsden and also stars Maya Rudolph, Gabriella Baldacchino, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Jayma Mays, is directed by Adam Shankman and features new songs from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. ‚ÄúDisenchanted‚Äù begins streaming November 24, exclusively on Disney+‚Ä¶just in time to brighten up the holiday season.\n \n\nIt has been 15 years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) wed, but Giselle has grown disillusioned with life in the city, so they move their growing family to the sleepy suburban community of Monroeville in search of a more fairy tale life. Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn‚Äôt been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family‚Äôs future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.\n\n\n‚ÄúDisenchanted stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Gabriella Baldacchino, with Idina Menzel and James Marsden. Directed by Adam Shankman from a screenplay by Brigitte Hales and a story by J. David Stem & David N. Weiss and Richard LaGravenese, ‚ÄúDisenchanted‚Äù is produced by Barry Josephson, Barry Sonnenfeld, and Amy Adams, with Jo Burn, Sunil Perkash, and Adam Shankman serving as executive producers. The movie features songs with music by 8-time Oscar¬Æ-winning composer Alan Menken and lyrics by three-time Oscar-winning lyricist Stephen Schwartz, whose work on ‚ÄúEnchanted‚Äù garnered three Academy Award¬Æ nominations and a score by Alan Menken.\n\n\nDisney‚Äôs ‚ÄúDisenchanted‚Äù begins streaming November 24, 2022, only on Disney+.","title":"Disenchanted | Official Trailer | Disney+","duration":124,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20220909","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRuwjZJ-DQw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dRuwjZJ-DQw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":6618625}}

{"description":"Please consider supporting me at https://www.patreon.com/LindsayHoliday\n\nThe United Kingdom has a new King. On September 8th, 2022, at the moment of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs death, Charles, as her eldest son and heir apparent, acceded the throne and became King. Within hours it was announced that he would reign under the regnal name of Charles III, ending years of speculation that he might choose a different moniker, possible that hos his Grandfather, George. Another matter of contention was the title his wife, Camilla would use. That too was cleared up when it was confirmed that she will be Queen Consort. In fact she is England‚Äôs first commoner queen consort in 475 years, since Henry VIII died in 1547 and his final wife, Catherine Parr was downgraded to Queen dowager. \rOn the September 10th the accession council meet at St. James‚Äôs Palace, as they have since the 1603 to declare Charles King. More about that later. However you may feel about Charles personally or the Monarchy in general, he is the modern link in a chain going back a thousand years. Let‚Äôs take a look at the fascinating, often controversial lives of the new King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms. \n\nCheck out the History Tea Time Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7iW8gOI5wb5TNFAIhBd9Om?si=46aeeacd64214ac0\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/history-tea-time/id1619978406\nGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy84Yzg1ZWU5MC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw\n\nMusic: Brandenburg Concerto No4-1 BWV1049 - Classical Whimsical by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100303\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nFor business inquiries, please contact LindsayHoliday@ellify.com","title":"King Charles III & Queen Camilla","duration":1227,"channel_id":"UCUsJAAPcT5T_hoSXdNfOP4Q","author":"History Tea Time with Lindsay Holiday","date":"20220910","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHm5duwNPHs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aHm5duwNPHs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2229155}}

Then there‚Äôs Brexiteer Boris Johnson - this film illuminates the very different relationships Queen Elizabeth has had with the many prime ministers who have served during her long reign. \n\nFilmmakers Katharina Wolff and Larissa Klinker examine Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs role as the symbol of a centuries-old power structure in the United Kingdom. Although the British monarch has no direct political power, the prime minister travels from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace every week for a private audience. \n\nIn this film, personal secretaries, political experts and Buckingham Palace insiders reveal what is discussed at these private meetings and how much impact personalities have on the relationship between royalty and the government.\n\nUsing archival footage and personal accounts, the film shows how the queen accompanied her prime ministers through their time in office. On September 6, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Liz Truss as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #QueenElizabeth \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

{"description":"Last year I made the decision to mostly use an iPhone 13 Pro Max. It was a compromise of moving over from the 12 and 13 mini iPhone because I fell in love with the 13 pro's improved camera system, and it was a compromise I was willing to make to gain those camera features. So why after my great year using the iPhone 13 Pro did I decide to get the bigger iPhone 14 Pro Max?
