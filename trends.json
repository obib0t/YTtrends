A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe‚Äôve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we‚Äôre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 We have COVID & Other News\n01:55 Hike - Nature‚Äôs Not Cooperating \n03:40 What's Next\n07:05 All Our Stuff\n09:07 Repair the Line Driver\n16:08 COVID RAT Test \n18:09 Largest Marina in the Southern Hemisphere \n22:33 Replace the Traveler Line\n26:45 The Last Boat Project Complete \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n¬© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"Last Boat Project As Owners","duration":1681,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220612","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyEeq0yzfXM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UyEeq0yzfXM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":129871}}

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n #travel #travelvlog #sailing\n\n00:00 moving onto a sailboat!\n01:17 who are Riley and Elayna?\n02:15 taking over their boat for 24 hours!\n03:47 world‚Äôs best toothpaste üòÅ\n04:42 FULL TOUR of La Vagabonde ‚õµÔ∏è\n09:42 Van life vs boat life?\n10:25 Can we sail alone?!üò±\n14:40 Lifting the anchor!\n16:29 hoisting the SAILS\n25:31 sunset beach bonfire üî•\n26:27 learning to free dive and spearfish\n27:19 driving the dingy in the dark ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","title":"MOVING ONTO A SAIL BOAT (living with La Vagabonde)","duration":1762,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220611","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIY4PSilhb4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uIY4PSilhb4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":559045}}

We waited about 40 minutes to get into the hotel because of delays. Once you are there, there's really no leaving (but you can if you absolutely 100% need to.  There is no pool in space lol. On the day of the Disney's Hollywood Studios visit, it took us about 1 hour to get to the park because of shuttle delays and we could not take our own transportation but they did end up \"making it right\".  After being home for about 1 week, Chase did say he actually liked the place and wanted to go back.  Shawn wonders if the show is always the same and he wants to check it out again but us other 4 would not need to ever go back to this hotel although it is cool and I think worth doing it once if you 1. like cosplay 2. like Starwars 3. like roleplay and 4. don't mind subjecting your digestive system to LOADS nd LOADS of food coloring. :)  but definitely watch our RECAP review at the end of the vid.\n\n\nüìöFGTeeV NY Times Best Selling Books:\n#1 FGTeev Into the Game ‚û° https://amzn.to/3lBoPnB\n#2 FGTeeV Saves the World ‚û° https://amzn.to/3laHoyA\n& FGTeeV Game Break‚û° https://amzn.to/2T5QmRX\n\nüéÆFGTeeV Games/Apps:\nü¶çAPE CHASE ‚û° http://smarturl.it/ApeChase\nüîäSOUND BOARD ‚û° http://smarturl.it/soundboard\nüßÅGOOZY ‚û° http://smarturl.it/goozy","title":"We Slept in Outer Space & Betrayed the Space People!

The Mandalorian was the first big streaming hit for Disney Plus and is now paving the way for a TON of other Star Wars projects, as well as serving as a launching pad for some of them. \n\nThe Mandalorian definitely raises a few questions though. Like how many side quests is Mando trying to complete? Is anything a serious threat when his armor makes him practically invincible? Why did Moff Gideon kill his own men and give up his advantage? Why do the bad guys have a sensitive info terminal that lets you use it if you just have a face? Is everything about the Skywalkers, in the end?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to The Mandalorian!

{"description":"I pride myself on combatting medical misinformation wherever it pops up, and unfortunately, it appears to have popped up in my own videos! That's right, over the course of the 500+ videos on my channel, I've been misinformed or mispoke a number of times. Today, I'm setting the record straight! I discuss popcorn lung and vaping, caffeine in Dayquil, methamphetamine in adderall, sneezing from bright light, OnlyJayus' thoughts on inhaling alcohol to ease nausea, caffeine in 7up and Mountain Dew, Post Traumatic Growth with Gabbi Hanna, cabbage leaves curing mastitis in your breasts, pesticides on produce, trypophobia, the staff of House MD, and my failed knockout of iDubbbz at Creator Clash!  \n\nI LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there‚Äôs a subject you want me to discuss or something you‚Äôd like for me to react to, leave a comment down below.

We are in a window of opportunity right now that we have not been in before. A window where it seems like real change, real change can happen. Uvalde, Texas is where I was born.\"\n\nWhile discussing the victims of the recent school shooting, McConaughey's wife Camilla holds green high-top Converse shoes of the one of the Uvalde, TX victims. \"These are the same green Converse on her feet that turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting.\"\n\nHe also says, \"Can both sides rise above?

These debilitating symptoms blur the line between what is real and what isn't, making it difficult for the person to lead a typical life.\n\nWe believe that Dedrick's schizophrenia is what led him to accidentally drive his car into Winston Lake 16-years earlier. \n\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to Dedrick's family during this difficult time.\n\nHug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è..
