{"description":"A jury has convicted a Wisconsin man of killing six people and injuring dozens of others when he drove his SUV into a Christmas parade last year. Darrell Brooks was found guilty Wednesday of all 76 charges, including six counts of first-degree intentional homicide. He drove into the parade in Waukesha on Nov. 21 after fleeing a domestic disturbance with an ex-girlfriend. Dozens of other people were hurt. Brooks dismissed his public defenders days before his trial began in early October and defended himself throughout the proceedings. He was removed from the courtroom at times for his erratic outbursts and confrontational exchanges with the judge.\n\nSubscribe to FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClwddNv0Cr6SIEGkzVK886w?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch FOX 9 Live: https://www.fox9.com/live\n\nFOX 9 is your source for breaking news, live events, investigations, politics, entertainment, business news and local stories from Minneapolis-St. Paul, the greater Twin Cities metro, Greater Minnesota, western Wisconsin and across the nation.

He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right‚Äîwithin two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he‚Äôs only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #CreamSoda #OfficialMusicVideo","title":"Quando Rondo - Cream Soda","duration":218,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20221026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJykscfd3-o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/IJykscfd3-o/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":636223}}

{"description":"Watch the Censored Version here: https://youtu.be/e-nO5DBMQDc\nIt felt wrong to write a whole script in Carmilla‚Äôs voice and not use some‚Ä¶ colorful adult language!! It‚Äôs too in character!! Anyway if you haven‚Äôt seen Castlevania, it‚Äôs a Netflix Original animation that‚Äôs (kind of, anyway haha) based off of the Castlevania video game series! I thought it was perrrrrfect to do for Halloween!!! Classic vampires :‚Äô) \nHopefully if you haven‚Äôt seen it, this video should be self-explanatory enough! I based it off of Season 2 (season 1 only has 4 episodes) - so you won‚Äôt get too many major spoilers, just setting up some stuff Carmilla wants to do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Listen I just really wanted an excuse to put up my Dracula portrait in the background (-: (BUT ITS BLURRED ANYWAY SO YOU CAN‚ÄôT EVEN SEE IT ARGH)\n\nALSO the video is so zoomed in; check out my instagram to see the whole dress!!

I know there are some Castlevania fans lurking in my community! :) \n\nPS - Carmilla is literally so evil, like just a very very bad person (vampire) - I tried to show off her more manipulative side in this video hehehehe. But she does touch your face and stuff WITHOUT ASKING..!!!! !!  but that‚Äôs it; shouldn‚Äôt be anything else bad in this video! \n\nHmmm what else!?\n-IM MAD ABOUT MY WIG, IF YOU NOTICE IT, NO YOU DIDN‚ÄôT \n-Also my accent.....

{"description":"The 2023 Honda Civic Type R (50,050$ in Canada, $42,895 starting in the US) is the newest rendition of the beloved hot hatchback from Japan. Now with more horsepower and more torque, along with a fresh new look, the new Civic Type R aims to please. 315 horsepower and 310 lb ft of torque are pushed out of a turbo four-cylinder engine, and a limited-slip differential up front helps ensure the power gets put down. Thomas takes the helm for his first drive in the new FL5 generation. Will it be able to live up to the previous generations and be a worthy successor?

A decade after their unforgettable eight-season run, comedy's most fabulous foursome is back. Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally reprise their celebrated roles as Will, Grace, Jack and Karen. The 11th and final season of Will & Grace will feature 18 episodes. Behold once again, from the minds of Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, TV's wittiest ensemble ever. The legendary James Burrows, director of every original Will & Grace episode, has returned with a slew of razor-sharp jabs and dirty martinis. Will & Grace stands as NBC's most watched comedy in seven years. Originally debuting in 1998, Will & Grace has been nominated for 91 Emmy Awards, winning 18 of them, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The series has also earned seven SAG Awards and the show is one of the few in TV history where each member of the cast has won an Emmy.\n\nWill & Grace\nhttps://www.youtube.com/WillandGrace\n\nGoogle Play, Just Watch & iTunes links\nhttps://play.google.com/store/tv/show/Will_Grace?id=NhiqWDfkmbrmj1fLIJpicA&hl=en_US&gl=US\nhttps://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/will-and-grace\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/tv-season/will-grace-series-1-8/id1291098172","title":"The Legend: Beverly Leslie ü§ç  | Will & Grace","duration":486,"channel_id":"UCLem9J0NkphqGbIYX5_uZBw","author":"Will & Grace","date":"20221025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00nuImDfnjA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/00nuImDfnjA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":451446}}

{"description":"Speculation has been swirling since former Chinese President Hu Jintao was escorted out from the closing session of China‚Äôs twice a decade Communist Party‚Äôs Congress on Saturday (Oct 22), which saw Mr Hu's successor, Xi Jinping secure an unprecedented third term at the helm. \n\nCNA‚Äôs cameras captured the moments just prior to Mr Hu's departure, which took place soon after local and foreign media were allowed to enter the auditorium to cover proceedings around 11.15am. It came shortly after Chinese state media announced that delegates had elected a new Central Committee and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which media were not allowed into the hall to witness. \n\nCurrent chairman of China's legislature Li Zhanshu is seen taking papers out of Mr Hu's hand, before a man comes to speak to him and escorts him out. READ: https://cna.asia/3TwGKK7\n\nFollowing Mr Hu‚Äôs departure, proceedings continued with delegates voting on other items on the agenda including an amendment to the party‚Äôs constitution. Addressing the incident later that night, Chinese state media attributed the incident to health reasons. In a tweet written in English, Xinhua said that Mr Hu was ‚Äúnot feeling well‚Äù during the session and for his health, staff had accompanied to a room next to the meeting venue ‚Äúfor a rest‚Äù. Mr Hu's name was censored from Chinese social media.\n\nREAD MORE: https://cna.asia/3z7jDNS\n\nSubscribe to our channel here: https://cna.asia/youtubesub \n\nSubscribe to our news service on Telegram: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\nFollow us:\nCNA: https://cna.asia\nCNA Lifestyle: http://www.cnalifestyle.com \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@channelnewsasia","title":"Exclusive: What happened before former Chinese President Hu Jintao was escorted out of Congress?","duration":176,"channel_id":"UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg","author":"CNA","date":"20221024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBG2bD-TE9g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZBG2bD-TE9g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2733720}}
