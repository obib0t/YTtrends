{"description":"I built The MOST SECURE BASE on this Minecraft SMP, and rigged it with tons of Deadly Traps. This is the SAFEST Base Ever!\n\nLike ParrotX2 videos and the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server Not like Dream SMP or Tommyinnit or Technoblade or any other Dream SMP members. This SMP is like LifeStealSMP and OneTrySMP, this is the hardest Minecraft Sever ever! and it is also a lore-based server in the MCYT community. I hope you enjoy this video, a true Minecraft hardcore server. Not only that, this server has the elements of school SMP and lifesteal SMP, but everything is Hardcore. This is a Hardcore SMP server.\n\nThis series is inspired by Wadzee, sandiction and Luke TheNoteable Series, as well as Mumbo Jumbo and Grian on the Hermitcraft server. However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo, Grian, sandiction, it's actually just Wenzo.

{"description":"All Money made from this video will be donated to Make-A-Wish: https://wish.org/\nSo many kids are going through a lot worse stuff than I am and Make-a-Wish does a really great job in making their dreams come true and creating positive memories.\n\nFor the last year and a half I have not been able to be physical, jump around, or do much martial arts in my videos,. This video explains why. The biggest of the eight tumors is near my tailbone and it causes a lot of pain whenever I'm standing or walking. If I try running or doing a jump it feels like a knife is being stabbed deep into my tailbone. Sitting or standing for more than 10 minutes also causes a lot of nerve pain shooting from my glutes, all the way down my hamstrings and into my calves. \n\nDuring the last year, we incorrectly worked under the diagnosis I had only a cyst in my tailbone. We tried five different smaller medical procedures (injections: epidurals, caudals). I also saw many different physical therapists three times per week over the course of eight months. After none of this was affective, we went to THE tailbone cyst expert down in Dallas, TX. He looked at the MRI scans and right away said \"That is not a cyst.\" I then saw other experts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and another in Dallas. \n\nAt USC Medical in Los Angeles we learned I had a total of eight tumors. The surgeon performed a spinal tap (not fun) to see if we could learn more about what these mysterious growths were. The results were inconclusive and now the last thing to do is to remove one of the tumors, do a biopsy on it, and learn exactly what is going on. We hope by removing the largest tumor that I'll have some pain relief as well.:","title":"I Have 8 Tumors","duration":408,"channel_id":"UCwaNuezahYT3BOjfXsne2mg","author":"Chad Wild Clay","date":"20221210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbCAu5t25m8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SbCAu5t25m8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1666606}}

The goal is to run 8 second quarter mile. passes while still  being completely streetable. \nI found the car in an airplane hangar and bought it with 46,000 miles on the odometer. It's clean, rust free, and now sports a mandrel bent pro-touring style chassis from MRC Fab. It rolls on Mickey Thompson drag radials and Weld double bead lock wheels. The engine is going to be a twin-turbo big-block Chevy with AC and power steering.

{"description":"Back in July when I officially became sponsorless, I started thinking about exactly the bike I wanted for the first time in years. I knew I wanted a titanium hardtail, but nobody made the exact geometry I really preferred. The reach was always too long, or the size small had some bend in the seat tube that would prevent my dropper post from being inserted the whole way.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I realized that ‚Äúzero-compromise‚Äù would mean having a custom frame built. So I started my conversation with Sage, who makes built to order titanium frames out of Oregon.  Not only did I get the exact geometry that I wanted, but also a custom paint job. I was against painting the titanium at all from the start, but they won me over with a custom Cerakote scheme that covers only the rear of the bike. \n\nI also picked out all the parts for this bike. Some companies I had contacts at, and I was able to get a discount or even a free part. But back when I started my orders, many companies were fresh out of stock, and so I needed to pay full retail sideways to get the parts in time. Had I compromised and taken parts that were available, or parts I could get for free, it would have been just that‚Äîa compromise. \n\nNow that the bike is finished, I‚Äôm really wondering how it rides! I took it down a dirt road while lugging around a bunch of cameras to get the finished shots, and then promptly got sick. Next week I‚Äôll ride the bike in all sorts of different conditions, and then go into more detail about the geometry!\n\nBlue Ridge Jerseys & Berm Peak Merch https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nSage Titanium https://sagetitanium.com/\nCustom knives https://www.instagram.com/oegedc\n\nThe Main Parts\nBerd Hawk 27 Wheels https://berdspokes.com/products/berd-hawk27-carbon-wheels\nFox 34 Factory https://amzn.to/3FfRk25\nCane Creek eeWings https://amzn.to/3iVknAr\nOneUp Carbon Bars https://amzn.to/3PoPr7Z\nTRP Evo Trail Brakes https://trpcycling.com/product/trail-evo/\nSram AXS XX1 Upgrade kit https://bit.ly/3VPc08n\nSram XX1 Cassette https://bit.ly/3FEfPHM\nOneUp EDC https://amzn.to/3iRnWIa\nOneUp Threadless Carrier https://amzn.to/3YaRcd0\nMaxxis Minion DHF https://amzn.to/3uKh8OU\nMaxxis Rekon https://amzn.to/3Yoho42\nRev Grips https://revgrips.com/collections/pro-series-grip-system/products/pro-series-ergonomic-grip-system\n\nBerm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts\nhttps://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nCheck out our second channel for more of the same https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpP5PqrzODWpFU961acUbg\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nMusic in this video is from \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg\n\nJoin my Patreon and 100% of the proceeds go towards projects in the mountain biking community.
