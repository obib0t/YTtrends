Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You'll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories- or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you're low on funds. Jobs and missions pay well, but you'll need to use that money to maintain your truck. When you think your truck is powerful enough, and you have enough bankroll for major repairs, use your truck to complete some of the map's challenges, such as races, rock crawls, hill climbs, and very destructive long jumps.\n\nIf you're not good with mechanics, don't worry. Your truck comes with a fully illustrated service manual. The town also has a mechanic who can give inspections, or even make repairs if you have the cash.\n\n- Fully integrated stock engine and drivetrain with over 60 stock parts, a swappable V8 engine with even more parts, and lots of aftermarket parts.\n- Upgradeable parts such as EFI conversion, headers, drive gears, turbochargers, several off road tire options, and accessories.\n- Fully responsive engine and drivetrain which exhibits true-to-life performance and auditory feedback on part failure, temperature, or fluid issues.\n- Miles of off road trails and roadways.\n- Open world game with freedom to play how you want to play.\n- Off road challenges; some which are difficult, others which are nearly impossible.\n- Make money with heavy delivery missions, rescue missions, collecting junk around the map and recycling it at the junkyard. Or work for yourself by brewing moonshine, logging, mining, or pressing your luck at the pub playing Texas Hold'em.\n- Day and night cycle, requiring you maintain your food, hydration, and sleep.\n- Softbody physics.","title":"How to Be the Worst Neighbor In Existence","duration":1058,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220930","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8KmRw8610","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/J_8KmRw8610/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1484778}}

Go to http://casetify.com/safiya today to save 15% off your order! \n\nAlso, if you would like to enter the franken lip gloss giveaway to win one of these semi-plumping bad boys, make sure you're subscribed, leave a comment down below, and then fill out the google form right here:! https://forms.gle/YvMtUnZ6bZcJpCKH8\n\nHELLO FRIENDS! So we were itching to whip up another batch of franken makeup, and we realized lip glosses had escaped our grasp up until this point – but not anymore! So yet again, we raided Sephora, buying one of each lip gloss they had in stock and then mixing them all together into one franken-batch to rule them all. What did you think of our final color? \n\nAlso also, if you’d like to learn more about the makeup recycling service that we used at Nordstrom, you can read about it on their site here: https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/get-involved/nordstrom-beauty-cycle \n\nOn top of all of that, if you’d like to buy yourself some of our Fiendish Behavior merchandise, you can check out our shop here: https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nPS - in case you want some more from us, we did just post ANOTHER franken video today over on Tyler’s channel. It features us testing out our own separate approaches towards frankening together one of every oreo flavor we could find. We’re calling it the Frank-Off! So be sure to check it out as well.

Allegedly released in 1989, the creepy game could only be played once and no copies of it remain, spurring on a desperate and frenzied search for the lost media.

{"description":"Halloween Ends - The Final Trailer\nIn theaters and streaming only on Peacock October 14\n\nThis is Laurie Strode’s last stand. \n\nAfter 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive. \n\nIcon Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the last time as Laurie Strode, horror’s first “final girl” and the role that launched Curtis’ career. Curtis has portrayed Laurie for more than four decades now, one of the longest actor-character pairings in cinema history. When the franchise relaunched in 2018, Halloween shattered box office records, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing chapter and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a horror film starring a woman. \n\nFour years after the events of last year’s Halloween Kills, Laurie is living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and is finishing writing her memoir. Michael Myers hasn’t been seen since. Laurie, after allowing the specter of Michael to determine and drive her reality for decades, has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell; The Hardy Boys, Virgin River), is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can’t control, once and for all. \n\nHalloween Ends co-stars returning cast Will Patton as Officer Frank Hawkins, Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and James Jude Courtney as The Shape.  \n\nFrom the creative team that relaunched the franchise with 2018’s Halloween and Halloween Kills, the film is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Paul Brad Logan (Manglehorn), Chris Bernier (The Driver series), Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Halloween Ends is produced by Malek Akkad, Jason Blum and Bill Block. The executive producers are John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Ryan Freimann, Ryan Turek, Andrew Golov, Thom Zadra and Christopher H. Warner. \n\nUniversal Pictures, Miramax and Blumhouse present a Malek Akkad production, in association with Rough House Pictures. \n\nhttps://www.halloweenmovie.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/halloweenmovie/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/halloweenmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HalloweenMovie/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics?lang=en","title":"Halloween Ends - The Final Trailer","duration":128,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20220927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0vtbxLa-N8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/s0vtbxLa-N8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":5509738}}

After seeing \"Slave For You,\" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, \"Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.\"\n\nProd Co: UnderWonder Content\nProducers: Robert Katz, Frank Borin, Ivana Borin \nDirector: Tanu Muino\n\nWatch more Elton videos: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WatchMore\nSubscribe to Elton channel: http://bit.ly/EltonYTSubscribe \n\nFollow Elton John on...\nFacebook: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/facebookYT \nTwitter: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/twitterYT \nInstagram: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/instaYT \nOfficial Website: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WebsiteOfficial \nJoin the Rocket Club newsletter: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/RocketClub \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/EltonJohn","title":"Elton John, Britney Spears - Hold Me Closer (Official Video)","duration":205,"channel_id":"UCI8Ry7NdFNLel-S8dWU7mDA","author":"EltonJohnVEVO","date":"20220927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qExVlz3zb0k","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/hqdefault.jpg?v=6332f93b","content":{"View count":1295749}}

They're taking a look at 5 more classic Disney couples to see what's good, what's bad, and what's ugly. This time we've got The Aristocats (Duchess and O'Malley), Hercules (Hercules and Meg), Mulan (Mulan and Shang), The Princess and the Frog (Tiana and Naveen), and Tarzan (Tarzan and Jane) to see which couples might be headed for tough times ahead, and which seem to be on pretty good footing to get to happily ever after. From lying about their identity or goals, to facing preconceived notions about people or life, to literally dying, there's some pretty big hurdles for some of these couples to overcome.\n\nJoin our Patreon: https://patreon.com/CinemaTherapy \n\nWatch the first round of Ranking Disney Romances: https://youtu.be/qnLklLumhqY\n\nCinema Therapy is:\nWritten by: Megan Seawright, Jonathan Decker, and Alan Seawright\nProduced by: Jonathan Decker, Megan Seawright, Alan Seawright, and Sophie Tellez\nEdited by: Sophie Téllez\nDirector of Photography: Bradley Olsen\nEnglish Transcription by: Anna Preis","title":"Relationship Therapist Ranks Disney Romances 2","duration":1795,"channel_id":"UCCYX4s1DCn51Hpf1peHS30Q","author":"Cinema Therapy","date":"20220927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA6rt50o8Tg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/tA6rt50o8Tg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":495595}}
