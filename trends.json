{"description":"Go to https://squarespace.com/vanwives to get a free trial and 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain \n\nWelcome back, Pack! With our never-ending renovations, improvements and gardening we've been doing this spring, we've decided to give our tired and sore backs some help by tag-teaming in a legend in the world of gardening: THE TRACTOR! A 2012 Kubota B26, bright orange tractor with 1800 hours on it to be precise ü§† That's right, through a twist of fate and a bit of good fortune, we were able to get one recently and it's beautiful. And we need YOUR help in naming it! Please comment your names below! üëá But first we have to learn how to drive it, use the bucket, backhoe and forklift. This thing turns on a dime, lifts giant payloads with ease, and is generally so much fun to drive that maybe we're going to become the TractorWives?! Okay maybe not just yet, but we're in love with this tractor. Maybe we can even start a new landscaping side-hustle: C&J's Landscaping! Has a nice ring to it, eh? No more walking on sharp rocks, breaking our backs lifting for hours a day. The backhoe mode is kind of the opposite of the lifter mode, and after some trial and error, we were able to plant our first cedar tree with it. For anyone who's never operated a tractor before, it's almost like playing a video game like Smash Brothers, where your button inputs suddenly become backwards. We're so happy! We also checked in on our little seedlings in our green house and are so excited to show you how much they've grown already üåû And we're finally creating a pathway for our fruit garden. We can't wait to see what new projects we can complete with our new tractor friend.

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

The area had a large fallen tree in it that I burnt into 3 pieces and rolled out of the way with logs as levers. I may build a hut in this area and so cleared it.\nNext, I dug a pit to mix clay in and collected the new source of clay. The old brick mold (made in a previous video) was used to make 50 bricks that were then allowed to dry. \nWhile this was happening I dismantled the old kiln and used its bricks to make a new one. The new configuration uses only 74 bricks instead of the previous 100, a significantly simpler design. Its firebox is formed by crisscrossing 2 layers of bricks so that air enters in the first layer channels and wood enters the 2nd layer channels at right angles to the first. The new kiln has 3 firing holes instead of the previous 2 of the last design. The new design also has all the bricks stacked on their sides so there is less chance of breakage.\nI fired the bricks and the kiln went ok. There were some cold spots at the top but this may be due to the fact I used less wood than usual, with the firing only taking 2.5 hours (ran out of wood). 3 hours would be better and more wood should be collected beforehand ( a 75x75x100cm pile as opposed to 75x75x75cm pile used this time). The bricks in the coldest area still passed a water test without dissolving though, so it was a success.\nAsh from the firring was made into bricks for storage as they can be used for mortar by calcining (firing in the kiln) later and mixing with sand and water.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #BrickKiln #Kiln","title":"Primitive Technology: New Brick Kiln Design","duration":835,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230602","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SH4irC_xMs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7SH4irC_xMs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1002542}}

{"description":"The Miami Heat managed to hold off the Boston Celtics from making a 3-0 comeback, securing their second trip to the NBA Finals in five years, their first appearance since the 2020 NBA Bubble Finals.\n\nThe Miami Heat have executed despite not having a star-studded roster outside of Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. Head Coach Erik Spoelstra is making a convincing case to be the best coach in the entire league, putting players like Caleb Martin and Gabe Vincent into positions where they can succeed. The Caleb Martin game 7 performance was what ultimately helped elevate them to the win. Erik Spoelstra managed to navigate the Gabe Vincent injury masterfully.\n\nThe success of guys like Caleb Martin highlights the importance of maximizing undrafted talent and knowing how to use guys in ways that maximizes their strengths. The Miami Heat do this arguably better than any other team in the NBA. It's what made Heat vs Celtics such a contentious matchup, and why the Celtics had such a hard time handling it.\n\nEven guys like Haywood Highsmith getting significant run, defending premiere players like Jayson Tatum, is a testament to how the Miami Heat keep a big toolbox of players for any given scenario. Even when Jimmy Butler was struggling, they had guys who could step up. Jayson Tatum's injury was certainly something that might've helped, but the Boston Celtics just didn't step up. This win officially made them the first 8th seed in NBA history to make the NBA Finals in a non-lockout season.\n\n‚û• ùôéùô™ùôóùô®ùôòùôßùôûùôóùôö: https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexHoops?sub_confirmation=1\n‚û• ùôèùô¨ùôûùô©ùô©ùôöùôß: https://twitter.com/AlexHoops_\n‚û• ùòΩùôöùôòùô§ùô¢ùôö ùôñ ùôãùôñùô©ùôßùô§ùô£: https://patreon.com/AlexHoops\n\n‚û• ùôñùôóùô§ùô™ùô© ùô¢ùôö\nProviding NBA analysis by making film digestible and using analytics thoughtfully to contextualize on-court production.
