A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Feeling Untethered \n02:13 Start the South Island Road Trip\n03:26 Flea Bay - Banks Peninsula\n04:26 NZ Fur Seal Encounter\n06:39 Surfshark.deals/WYNNS\n07:58 Akaroa Head - Banks Peninsula\n11:37 What's Next - Our Loose Travel Plan\n13:25 New Catamaran Update - WHEN & WHERE\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"WE’RE IN A WEIRD PLACE (+boat update & what's next)","duration":928,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220807","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YrJVpTtY6g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4YrJVpTtY6g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":99981}}

The kitchen has a farmhouse style with a deep sink, induction stove, and plenty of gear for outdoor cooking. The rooftop deck has a sturdy railing so the entire family can enjoy the views, including hammocks that can hang from the safety guards!

{"description":"BUY THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT AMY MERCH HERE: https://mashed.teemill.com/\n\nAmy Rose thought her transformation was going to be the catalyst for a whirlwind romance with Sonic the Hedgehog. But, she let her Sonic mania get the better of her, which resulted in a Sonic vs Amy showdown. So, it doesn’t look like Sonic and Amy will ever be a thing now. In lieu of the opportunity to now call herself Mrs. Sonic Hedgehog, Amy is turning to the one person she knows will help her in her time of need: Miles Tails Prower.\n\nAfter making Sonic boom, Tails is well aware that Amy needs some guidance… and a shovel. After all, what are friends for? So, off to the woods they go to try and salvage this Sonic exe situation. But, it’s here where Amy learns of the truth about this Sonic origins story. Or, truthfully, this Tails origin story. To the two-tailed fox, this has just been one big Sonic game. One big game with his best friends.\n\nProduced by Tom Jenkins and Ben Michael\nWritten by Jason Dewey and Ben Michael\n\nPre Production by Ben \"Wonchop\" Smallman\n\nRough Animation by Esau \"LDranzer\" A.

{"description":"yEAAHHH. So, after wasting 20 bucks on Clawee and other virtual claw machine apps, basically I went nuts and bought an ACTUAL claw machine. It's currently hanging out in my art room and I'm hoping to eventually fill it with cool prizes like squishies, plushies and other cute items that are fun to customize. However, there is oneeeee little problem. This claw machine is NOT my style at all. SOOO. I am going to spend a couple weeks customizing the claw machine itself first. I am actually going to paint this entire claw machine. Wish me luck.\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 27 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here.

{"description":"A day in the life of a Japanese Knife maker working in knife factory in Seki City Japan.  This is what a typical work day would be for a knife technician in the factory and outside of workplace.  The Japanese work culture can be seen in her everyday activities.  Also, this is how Japanese knives are made. Nene works as a knife technician at Zwilling J.A. Henckels Japan, originally a 291-year-old German Knife maker who eventually setup an office in Japan and later acquired their knife factory here in Seki city, also known in Japan as the city of blades, crafting flawless samurai swords and knives for more than 800 years and producing half of Japan’s total knives in this city alone.  Today, 90% of the company’s knives sold in Japan are actually made here at this factory.  Throughout her shift, she’s tasked with inspecting knives being crafted that day, to ensure that each knife meets the factory’s strict quality standards. Which also means that she’s responsible for knowing the details about each and every knife that’s crafted in the factory including the entire build process for that individual knife and the technical requirements each one must satisfy in order for her to fully perform the inspections. In fact, all the workers are required to undergo basic training when joining, and during the training period, each worker’s skills are assessed and based on their strengths, assigned a specific role such as sharpening knifes, welding, etc.  Apparently, sharpening the knives by hand is one of the most challenging parts when crafting a knife.  So much so, the factory itself only has 9 specialists who have mastered the skill, and at the moment only 2 who are skilled enough to perform Kiwami Honbazuke, the most extreme and technical knife sharpening possible.\n\nZwilling J.A.

I first built the frame which was made of two tripods set close together. They were of wood and lashed together with cane. Then I made a basket from cane to hold the large rocks that would act as the counterweight. For the sling I used bark fiber from dead branches of a certain type of tree. The bark was stripped and the inner bark woven into rope. The rope was then made into a sling using 2 knots and thinner rope was used to weave the sling pouch. A simple toggle release was used hold the throwing arm in position and act as the trigger. The counter weight was then filled with rocks and pulled into position to be held by the toggle. A shot-put sized stone was then placed into the sling pouch. When the toggle was released the stone would be launched 18- 20 meters (the length of the clearing) but could undoubtedly shoot further if more weight was added. Targets were set up and destroyed. Range can be adjusted by adding or subtracting weight from the basket, while shooting to the left or right is done by turning the whole catapult while the basket is empty. The whole build took 5 weeks, the hardest part being collecting the bark fiber to make the rope. The trebuchet is a simple but effective way to deliver payloads to a target destination.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Chocolate covered ice cream bars are similar to gold bars, except they are made of different materials. The materials are ice cream and chocolate, as opposed to gold.\n\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nBook http://yousuckatcooking.com\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\n\nRecipe\n\nLike most ice cream bar recipes, we're taking two well known recipes and combinating them: no churn ice cream, and home made magic shell, both of which have been around since the dawn of time. \n\nThe Ice Cream\n2 cups of heavy cream or whipping cream \nWhip it or don't whip it  \n1 can of sweetened condensed milk (small can, 300-400ml/14oz)\n1 teaspoon of vanilla extract \n\nCombine those things together. A lot of recipes say you should mix the vanilla with the condensed milk first but I'm skeptical that it makes a difference. Even more skeptical as I am of Sasquatch because I'm not skeptical of Sasquatch at all because they're real. \n\nSo pour your non-iced cream into ice cream moulds and freeze them overnight. Don't dick around and try to freeze them for just a few hours. You need the ice cream to be mega cold for this to work. \n\nMagic Shell\n\nMelt two bags of chocolate chips or another kind of chocolate \nAdd 1 or 2 tablespoon of coconut oil but don't over do it \n\nMelt that stuff in a double boiler then wait for it to cool all the way down \n\nI'm gonna be honest with you...even as I thought I got the hang of this I was still messing it up when I was trying to make more. The weird thing was the first couple came out fine then the one after that slipped off. WHY? I don't know.  But one thing I know is you gotta refreeze those bars after you take them out if there is any meltitude on the outside. If you have molds that let you pull them out without them melting, then congratulations. \n\nBut yeah, if you figure out which chocolate works best lemme know. \n\nAnyway, cold ice cream, not hot chocolate, give it a dip, let a lot of the chocolate drip off, then hold it in the hair until it sets before you lay it back in a container for freezing. \n\nI could have gotten into all these details in the video but, you know, I got distracted. \n\nEmma explains it better and I got the no-whipping tip from her: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es1XDaX0n3g","title":"Easy Chocolate Covered Ice Cream Bars Recipe","duration":270,"channel_id":"UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w","author":"You Suck At Cooking","date":"20220804","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3d0zQRPk4U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/T3d0zQRPk4U/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":329677}}

{"description":"Machine Gun Kelly, iann dior - fake love don’t last (Official Live Performance) \n\nWhether rapping, as he did in the early part of his career, or rocking, as he's doing these days, Machine Gun Kelly is one of those artists who starts fierce and gets fiercer. That impact comes from the punch of emotion at the core of his tunes - the guy comes on strong from the get-go. You can hear it on 2012's \"Wild Boy\" from his 'Lace Up' debut, and it's there on both the 'BINGE' and 'bloom' albums from a few years ago. In May, Billboard said \"there’s no one on the charts serving balls-to-the-wall rock’n’roll decadence like the 31-year-old musician.\" It's hard to disagree. Since he turned a punk-pop corner with blistering guitar tracks such as \"bloody valentine\" - a blitzkrieg bop if there ever was one - the Halsey duet \"forget me too,\" and his blackbear romp \"my ex's best friend,\" he's moved from respected cool guy to flat-out superstar. And he takes the success in stride; the name of his latest album is 'mainstream sellout.' If you caught the Billboard Awards in May, you know he poured it all out in his performance of \"Twin Flame.\" So much so that his sweetie Megan Fox tweeted her approval in a gushing example of PDA. \"Baby – so proud of you for giving such a vulnerable and emotional performance. You are magic.\" We also know that MGK has a cheeky side too, especially when talking about ex’s. “Mood” singer iann dior joined the show for “fake love don’t last,” a pop punk bop that sticks in your head regardless of relationship status. \n\nWatch the official video of \"more than life\": https://youtu.be/BokDch3_g-Y\nWatch music videos by Machine Gun Kelly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUs8sGiP4avNaYNVO22INhQ\n\nMachine Gun Kelly \nhttps://tiktok.com/@machinegunkelly\nhttp://twitter.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://instagram.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://facebook.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://machinegunkelly.com\n\nVevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\nDirector: Kyle Goldberg\nDirector of Photography: Skyler Brown\nSenior Line Producer: Jen Bates\nLine Producer: Maddy Schmidt\nProducer: Averi Smith\nProducer, Contrast Films: Haley Sliger\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nArt Director: Daniel Erb\n1st AD: Evan Coniglio\nProduction Coordinator: Cole Emery\n2nd AD: Aris Ray\n1st AC: Adam Marquez\n1st AC: Ben Steen\n2nd AC: Melissa Kirchho\n2nd AC: Keith Hudson\nJib/Crane Op: Christian Hurley\nCrane Tech: Harrison Reilly\nCrane Tech: Lucas Reilly\nDIT: Benjamin Crump\nProduction Assistant: Jordan Dominguez\nProduction Assistant: Mario Arita\nProduction Assistant: Dilllon Weidler\nProduction Assistant: Johnny Baez\nProduction Assistant: Matt Callahan\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nOn Set Dresser: Eric Moore\nOn Set Dresser: Tim Miller\nOn Set Dresser: Sydney Weinberger\nLighting Designer: Josh Beard\nKey Grip: Julien Janigo\nBest Boy Grip: Darrin Stuckwisch\nVFX Supervisor: Sydney Emery\nVFX: Austin Prahl\nMotion Design: Sydney Emery\nMotion Design: Jakub Blank\nDesign: Nick Resnicow\nPhotography: Brandon Bowen\nAudio: Casey Graham\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nColor: Company 3\nColorist: Joseph Bicknell\nPost Production Supervisor: Michael Colman\nProject Manager, Post Production: Dominic Siri\nMusic + Talent: Gabriela Prisciandaro + David McTiernan\n\n#MachineGunKelly  #fakelovedontlast  #mainstreamsellout  \n\nMusic video by Machine Gun Kelly, iann dior performing fake love don’t last (Official Live Performance). © 2022 Bad Boy/Interscope Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/pYnx2p","title":"Machine Gun Kelly, iann dior - fake love don’t last (Official Live Performance) | Vevo","duration":145,"channel_id":"UC2a9zmrdjvLsrRgi4G4blWw","author":"MGKVEVO","date":"20220803","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs39Lj_LvWU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hs39Lj_LvWU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":969734}}

MZ세대의 아이콘, YENA(최예나)의 두 번째 미니 앨범 ‘SMARTPHONE’\n- 시원+상큼+긍정 에너지로 가득 찬 YENA(최예나)표 청량 서머송 \n- 한여름 무더위에 지친 모두를 구할 ‘게임 히어로’ YENA(최예나)가 등장했다!\n\n지난 1월, 솔로 데뷔 앨범이자 첫 번째 미니 앨범 ‘ˣ‿ˣ (SMiLEY)’를 통해 여성 솔로 아티스트로서 성공적인 시작을 알린 YENA(최예나)가 약 7개월 만에 두 번째 미니 앨범 ‘SMARTPHONE’을 발매한다. YENA(최예나)는 이번 앨범을 통해 발라드, POP, ROCK 등 다양한 장르에 도전하며 보컬리스트로서의 역량도 유감없이 발휘할 예정이다.\n\n솔직하고 당당한 매력으로 MZ세대의 아이콘이 된 YENA(최예나)의 두 번째 미니 앨범의 타이틀곡 ‘SMARTPHONE’은 한여름 무더위를 날릴 시원하고 청량한 멜로디와 YENA(최예나)의 밝고 당찬 에너지가 돋보이는 곡이다. 스마트폰이 일상이자 친구가 되어버린 현시대를 노래하며, 누구나 공감할 수 있는 이야기와 흥겨운 포인트 안무로 팬들의 시선을 사로잡을 예정이다.\n\n여기에 감미로운 피아노 사운드가 인상적인 ‘Make U Smile’과 파워풀한 보컬로 귀를 사로잡는 ‘WithOrWithOut’, 듣기만 해도 자동으로 어깨가 들썩여지는 청량한 ‘Lemon-Aid’, 그리고 러블리 긍정 에너지가 가득 담긴 ‘U’까지 앨범의 모든 트랙을 ‘예나답게’ 구성한 점이 인상적이다.\n\n뿐만 아니라 YENA(최예나)는 이번 ‘SMARTPHONE’ 뮤직비디오에서 스마트폰 세상 속 ‘게임 히어로’로 변신했다. 전작 ‘스마일 히어로’에 이어 또다시 ‘히어로’가 된 YENA(최예나)! 변화와 성장을 거듭하며 YENA(최예나)가 만들어갈 음악적 세계관과 스펙트럼에 귀추가 주목된다.\n\nYENA(최예나) 특유의 상큼하고 긍정적인 에너지가 고스란히 담긴 두 번째 미니 앨범 ‘SMARTPHONE’을 통해 힙하고 레트로한 바이브와 청량하고 상큼한 매력으로 여름 가요계를 강타할 YENA(최예나)의 활약을 기대해본다.\n\n01 Make U Smile\n02 SMARTPHONE (*Title)\n03 WithOrWithOut\n04 Lemon-Aid\n05 U\n\n\nMake U Smile\n\n‘Make U Smile’ 은 아름다운 스트링을 담고 있는 hypnotic 피아노 발라드 곡이다. 감미로운 멜로디와 감성적인 보컬을 느낄 수 있다.  \n지구를 지키기 위해 여정을 떠난 스마일 히어로 예나를 기다리는 정원 앞 꽃들에게 전하는 예나의 메시지를 담은 가사에서 애틋함을 표현했다.\n\n\nSMARTPHONE (*Title)\n\n‘SMARTPHONE’ 은 전자기타 사운드가 돋보이는 Upbeat Pop/Rock 장르로, 에너제틱한 드럼 비트와 전자베이스 사운드가 매력적인 곡이다. 예나의 신나는 보컬과 함께 폭발하는 후렴구의 멜로디와 브라스는 리스너들을 자극하며 리듬감을 배가하기에 충분하다.\n스마트폰이 일상이자 친구가 되어버린 현시대를 예나의 시선으로 표현한 곡이다. \n\n\nWithOrWithOut\n\n‘WithOrWithOut’ 은 지난 수록곡인 ‘Lxxk 2 U’ 에 이어, 보다 강하고 파워풀한 예나의 음악을 들려주는 Rock 장르의 곡이다. 드럼과 일렉 기타, 그리고 Pop 요소들이 함께 어우러진 사운드가 인상적이다.\n항상 함께 했던 친구와 소원해지는 과정에서 느끼는 미묘하고 섬세한 감정을 표현했다. 내가 아닌 다른 사람과 더 가까워진 친구가 밉지만, 여전히 사랑하는 마음을 “너와 함께든 아니든 상관없어!” 라는 가사로 역설적으로 표현한 곡이다.\n\n\nLemon-Aid\n\n여름의 청량함을 담아낸 ‘Lemon-Aid’ 는 90년대 스타일의 업템포 곡이다. 마치 함께 춤을 추는 듯한 베이스와 보컬, 여기에 재미난 코드 진행과 피아노 사운드가 돋보인다.\n사랑하는 친구를 Lemon에 빗대어, 그 친구와 함께 있으면 치유(Aid)가 된다는 의미로 ‘Lemon-Aid’라는 새로운 단어를 만들었다.\n특히 후렴구의 ‘넌 내겐 La La Lemon Lemon! La La La Lemon-Aid’ 가사는 남녀노소 모두 따라 부를 수 있는 상큼함과 캐치함이 담겨 있어 눈길을 끈다.\n\n\nU\n\n신나는 Pop 곡인 ‘U’ 는 드럼 비트와 퍼커션 그리고 캐치한 브라스가 곡의 전체적인 흐름을 담당하고 있고, 마치 뮤지컬을 연상시키는 풍성한 멜로디가 인상적이다. 세상 모든 것이 아름답게 보이는 긍정 소녀의 사랑 이야기를 담은 가사가 돋보이는 곡이다.\n\n\n#YENA #최예나 #SMARTPHONE","title":"YENA (최예나) - SMARTPHONE MV","duration":208,"channel_id":"UC_pwIXKXNm5KGhdEVzmY60A","author":"Stone Music Entertainment","date":"20220803","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ncp-_GXBsU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5ncp-_GXBsU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":13178346}}
