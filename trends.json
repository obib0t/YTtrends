{"description":"Continuing the #Disney100 celebration with this new look at #TheLittleMermaid! Just 100 days until it arrives in theaters!\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton,” “Snowpiercer”) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca,” “Room”) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      \n\n“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton,” “In the Heights”), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”), who won two Oscars® for the music in the animated version of “The Little Mermaid,” with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (“Mary Poppins Returns,” “Into the Woods”). Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics are by Howard Ashman and new lyrics are by Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nFacebook: @DisneyTheLittleMermaid\nInstagram: @DisneyLittleMermaid\nTwitter: @LittleMermaid\nHashtag: #TheLittleMermaid","title":"The Little Mermaid | Wish","duration":30,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20230215","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQCfbmhIjzo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/VQCfbmhIjzo/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1535254}}

{"description":"Watch your future unfold. From the writer of Contagion comes Extrapolations, premiering March 17 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/_Extrapolations\n\nExtrapolations is a bracing drama from writer, director and executive producer Scott Z. Burns that introduces a near future where the chaotic effects of climate change have become embedded into our everyday lives. Eight interwoven stories about love, work, faith and family from across the globe will explore the intimate, life-altering choices that must be made when the planet is changing faster than the population. Every story is different, but the fight for our future is universal. And when the fate of humanity is up against a ticking clock, the battle between courage and complacency has never been more urgent. Are we brave enough to become the solution to our own undoing before it’s too late?\n\nThe series stars Meryl Streep, Sienna Miller, Kit Harington, Daveed Diggs, Edward Norton, Diane Lane, Tahar Rahim, Yara Shahidi, Matthew Rhys, Gemma Chan, David Schwimmer, Adarsh Gourav, Keri Russell, Marion Cotillard, Forest Whitaker, Eiza González, Murray Bartlett, Indira Varma, Tobey Maguire, MaameYaa Boafo, Hari Nef, Heather Graham, Michael Gandolfini, Cherry Jones, Gaz Choudhry, Ben Harper, Judd Hirsch and Neska Rose. \n\nExtrapolations is executive produced by Burns, Gregory Jacobs, Dorothy Fortenberry and Media Res’ Michael Ellenberg and Lindsey Springer.

{"description":"Richmond Till We Die. Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso\n\nIn this third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them as last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.\n\nSong: “I Still Believe” by Frank Turner https://apple.co/IStillBelieve_FrankTurner \n\nAudio Description Version available: https://apple.co/TedLasso-\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Ted Lasso:\nhttps://twitter.com/TedLasso\n\nFollow AFC Richmond:\nhttps://twitter.com/AFCRichmond\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple TV+\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTVPlus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTVPlus\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

{"description":"On June 16, worlds collide. Watch the official trailer now for The Flash – only in theaters. #TheFlashMovie \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n“The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).\n\n“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers \nare Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch \n(“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023.","title":"The Flash – Official Trailer","duration":176,"channel_id":"UCiifkYAs_bq1pt_zbNAzYGg","author":"DC","date":"20230212","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vwaD9cHLNw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vwaD9cHLNw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5253686}}

{"description":"The end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga\n\n#FASTX","title":"FAST X | Official Trailer","duration":222,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32RAq6JzY-w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32RAq6JzY-w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":32341974}}

It’s why in just one year’s time, he’s already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80’s hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song “Never Comin’ Home” amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, “Fall In Love”, “Rock and A Hard Place”, and “Where It Ends”. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n© 2023 Warner Music Nashville LLC / 2023 Elektra Records\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #FixnToBreak #TikTok","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Fix'n To Break (Lyric Video)","duration":231,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhxEO5I-BCQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lhxEO5I-BCQ/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":318123}}

{"description":"Turquía es un país de terremotos, pero Italia, Grecia y los Balcanes también. Solo desde el año 2000, en la península de Anatólia se han registrado 18 terremotos por encima del grado 5 de magnitud. En Italia central, entre 2009 y 2016, se han registrado tres terremotos que han arrasado sus respectivas comarcas.\n\n¿Pero por qué en la región del Mediterráneo hay tantos terremotos? La razón es que en esta zona se encuentran los bordes de contacto de tres placas tectónicas. La placa euroasiática, la arábiga y la africana. En este vídeo explicativo veremos como a placas africana y arábiga están empujando hacia la placa euroasiática. Estos movimientos de las capas profunda de la Tierra provocan que una placa se monte por encima de la otra, provocando los terremotos y la formación de los Alpes y los Pirineos.\n\nDesde el sur, la costa de África se mueve empujando las Baleares, Córcega y Cerdeña contra Italia. Al otro lado, la placa arábiga también se separa de África y empuja hacia norte, creando las montañas del Cáucaso. Este empuje no se acabará hasta que el Mediterráneo no se haya cerrado por el desplazamiento conjunto de la placa africana y arábiga.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:29 ¿Por qué hay tantos terremotos en el Mediterráneo?\n02:14 Así está hecho el interior de la Tierra\n04:50 El futuro del Mediterráneo\n06:14 El planeta en 50 millones de años\n07:10 La gramática de los terremotos\n\n#terremotos #turquia #mediterraneo","title":"El terremoto de Turquía es una montaña que está naciendo en el Mediterráneo","duration":494,"channel_id":"UCY2hu_NT5NDbBU-HGxgqMuA","author":"El Confidencial","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzdXgo2J_dc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/BzdXgo2J_dc/hqdefault.webp?v=63e67001","content":{"View count":2080113}}
