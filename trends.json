{"description":"In Loving Memory of Tom Smothers.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers\n\nThe Smothers Brothers, Tom and Dick, are one of the most iconic comedy duos in the history of television. Tom and Dick began performing as a duo in the late 1950s, playing in coffeehouses and clubs in San Francisco. Their act consisted of music, comedy, and witty banter, which quickly gained them a following.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers became a household name in the late 1960s with their variety show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The show was groundbreaking in its approach to comedy, pushing the boundaries with political satire and social commentary. The show also featured up-and-coming musical acts, including The Doors and The Who, and introduced the world to comedians like Steve Martin and George Carlin.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers' irreverent style has made them a beloved and enduring force in American comedy. \n\nFor clip licensing information, contact Retro Media: http://www.retrovideo.com/ \n\nClown Jewels: \nOfficial Website: https://clownjewels.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@clownjewels\nFacebook: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/InstagramID\nTwitter: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n800 Pound Gorilla: \nOfficial Website: https://800poundgorillamedia.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@800pgm\nFacebook: https://800PGR.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://800PGR.lnk.to/InstagramID\nTwitter: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n#smothersbrothers","title":"In Loving Memory | Tom Smothers | 1937 - 2023 | If I Had A Ship","duration":366,"channel_id":"UCA2QfK-lVdi2j3LCns0j7LQ","author":"The Smothers Brothers","date":"20231227","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqHqm6wuGTo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wqHqm6wuGTo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":728302}}

It wasn‚Äôt a bait-and-switch, this is a double feature.\n\nSome people think that gaming guides should teach the viewer how to use an item or a character in the most optimal, effective way possible. Some people think that guides have to be a serious, well-informed take on a technique or style of play. Some people are stupid. Why bother being optimal with a weapon when you can be a true Mann Co.

{"description":"Bobby Carter | December 18, 2023\nScarface's Tiny Desk concert radiates with his decadeslong passion as an emcee and producer. There's calculated intent behind every word and note of this 30-minute set and I learned that his love for golf also runs deep during our initial meeting. He was playing a round and had difficulty dividing his attention between the plan and the course. Three days before the show, amid rehearsals, I got a call from Facemob asking, \"What if I brought Mike Dean?\" My expectations were already high, but that final addition set the stage for something special.\n\nMike Dean provided unmatched authenticity, and their shared stories added sentimental value to this performance. After all, his signature keys and synths can be heard on most of Scarface's classics and countless Rap-A-Lot records. Here, we get a rare glimpse of Scarface the conductor, bouncing through multiple eras of his catalog including \"On My Block,\" \"Mary Jane\" and the bone-chilling \"I Seen a Man Die.\"\n\nScarface, along with Rakim, was recently awarded the inaugural Hip-Hop Grandmaster Award from the newly launched Paid in Full Foundation, which includes a sizable financial prize and healthcare. No matter how the never-ending hip-hop greats debate is sliced, the rapper's place is cemented as one of the most influential storytellers in the culture and his Tiny Desk is proof.\n\nSET LIST\n\"On My Block\"\n\"Mary Jane\"\n\"Smile\"\n\"I Seen a Man Die\"\n\"F**k Faces\"\n\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nScarface: lead vocals, guitar\nMike Dean: keys\nSteven \"Spud\" Howard: vocals\nTakai \"Cookie\" Hicks: vocals \nPeigh Jones: vocals, guitar \nCorey \"FunkaFingers\" Stoot: guitar \nJosh Henderson: keys\nJason \"The Bishop\" Allen: keys\nSavar Martin: drums \nAnthony \"Antboogie\" Nicholson: bass, musical direction \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Maia Stern\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Alant√© Serene, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Ted Mebane\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Kara Frame, Hazel Cills\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #scarface","title":"Scarface: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1887,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20231218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajNYTJcF6rE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ajNYTJcF6rE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2536113}}

{"description":"Get tickets now: https://www.thechosenriseup.com/\n\n\"Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" That was the theme of Season 3. Jesus said this to a crowd of thousands before also saying it to Simon while they stood on water. Season 4? Jesus is weary and heavy-laden, and He needs rest.\n\nWe're getting closer and closer to Jerusalem, to what we know is coming. Jesus is getting increasingly frustrated, and yes, sad. Not because he's getting closer to death, but because of the reasons He must die. From his faith's religious leaders, to the holy city of Jerusalem, to his own friends and followers, people are not understanding his mission. To that end, He must allow painful things, and even set in motion certain confusing or bittersweet events, to accelerate the outcomes that will lead to Holy Week. \n\nSeason 4 marks the midpoint of the most famous and influential story in human history. It will be painful, and it will be joyous. It will be bittersweet. But by all measures, Season 4 will also be our best.\n\n- Dallas Jenkins, Creator of The Chosen","title":"The Chosen: Season 4 Official Trailer","duration":150,"channel_id":"UCBXOFnNTULFaAnj24PAeblg","author":"The Chosen","date":"20231218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wisX-CEjoxc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/wisX-CEjoxc/hqdefault.webp?v=657c826e","content":{"View count":1454540}}
