{"description":"Funny Marco welcomes Orlando Brown, an American actor, rapper and singer. He is best known for his roles as Cadet Kevin 'Tiger' Dunne in Major Payne, 3J Winslow in “Family Matters,” Max in “Two of a Kind,” Damey Wayne \"Waynehead\" in Waynehead, Sticky Webb in “The Proud Family,” Cornelius Fillmore in “Fillmore!,” Eddie Thomas in “That's So Raven,” and Frankie in “Eddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off.” \n \nIn this episode the antics and tension are felt immediately as the crew is late setting up and Orlando blows in the mic seeming to frustrate Marco who in turns starts interrogating Orlando about his experience working with Will Smith, which Orlando denies. Not one to take one word answers, Marco goes deep and asks Orlando about his past and if he has fumbled the bag. Orlando responds by saying he is all about love. As the interview continues Marco asks Orlando about his drip. The random questions from Marco seem to baffle and frustrate Orlando. Marco then asks the question on how Orlando feels about going from Disney to TMZ. Orlando responds that is part of the lifestyle of growing up under the spotlight. Orlando also says Marco owns the Shade Room and the Shade Room plays him. An argument starts with the crew as Orlando speaks in the camera to speak directly to The Shade Room. Marco then asks Orlando about Raven-Symone. Orlando calls Marco Raven and starts to sing the theme song to “That’s So Raven.” Marco then gets into Orlando’s rap career playing one of Orlando’s songs. Marco asks about his lyrics and Orlando talks about how Debbie Allen inspired him. Marco then shows Orlando a publicity shot of Orlando at Disney next to a mugshot. Orlando points out on his mugshot that he has a tattoo of Raven on his neck. Marco then asks Orlando about Mariah Carey for which Orlando says that her real name is Danielle and he would never sleep with his buddy Nick Cannon’s girl. The antics continue as Marco asks about Orlando’s high speed chase. Orlando gives a message to 50 Cent about being down. The producer comments that Orlando has a lifetime contract with Disney. Orlando vehemently denies the claim. Orlando claims Bill Cosby owns Disney and says R Kelly is guilty and he saw the tapes. As usual chaos ensues as Orlando seems patient but confused as he eats a snack. Orlando talks about the Straight Outta Compton feature that he was cut out of. Marco asks a question about Lil Bow Wow and Orlando makes the claim that Lil Bow Wow has “bomb ass pussy.”  \nThe crew is shocked at the comment but Marco stays professional. The crew is having problems as the sound man gets fired. Orlando starts to petition Lil Wayne’s manager Cortez Bryant, a guest in the crowd, for representation, making for an awkward moment. The random questions continue as Marco seems to be fed up.  \n \nExecutive Producers: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries IG @TheRealDaveMays @IGoByBrettJ\n \nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @MattAblesPromotions\n \nDirector of Photography: Rashid “Cruz” Terry\n \nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco\n \nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Orlando Brown talks TMZ, Disney, Raven Simone, 50 Cent plea, DMs Mariah Carey, Lil Bow Wow + More","duration":1532,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH2yzHSliu0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YH2yzHSliu0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":403693}}

If you've ever wondered about something in space and couldn't find an answer online - you can ask me! My day job is to do research into how supermassive black holes can affect the galaxies that they live in. In particular, I look at whether the energy output from the disk of material orbiting around a growing supermassive black hole can stop a galaxy from forming stars.\n\nhttp://drbecky.uk.com\nhttps://rebeccasmethurst.co.uk","title":"An astrophysicist's live reaction to the first JWST science images","duration":553,"channel_id":"UCYNbYGl89UUowy8oXkipC-Q","author":"Dr. Becky","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeEhUCAeac","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uZeEhUCAeac/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":309761}}

Additionally, you can grab our toolkits, modmats, mouse mats, or other items on the store.\n\nThis video took us months of work to compile, document, and research. We had to coordinate with landlords, brokers, former employees, lawyers, and more to dig deep into the shady, scummy operation of Artesian Builds and its former CEO Noah Katz, whom we've heard has thrown around the word \"lawsuit\" when talking about us. We will never back down from sharing the full story with consumers, especially when so many have been hurt by one company's actions.\n\nThis deep dive gains exclusive access to the East Coast warehouse formerly used by Artesian Builds, dives into finances, and uncovers behavior we believe to be potentially fraudulent.\n\nGet a GN Tear-Down Toolkit: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gamersnexus-tear-down-toolkit\nGet a GN Modmat for PC building! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat-volt-large\nOr a GN Blue & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-wireframe-mouse-mat\n\n(Error correction: It's a triceratops skull, not a tyrannosaurus skull)\n\r\nWatch our first part of this story here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9NzY8TDCAY\n\nLike our content?

But during his remarks, the president was interrupted by Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquin was one of 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.  \n\n» Subscribe to USA TODAY: http://bit.ly/1xa3XAh\n» Watch more on this and other topics from USA TODAY: https://bit.ly/3uHprM5\n» USA TODAY delivers current local and national news, sports, entertainment,  finance, technology, and more through award-winning journalism, photos, videos and VR.\n\n#Biden #Parkland #Shooting","title":"Biden interrupted by father of Parkland victim | USA TODAY","duration":60,"channel_id":"UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g","author":"USA TODAY","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8P75mHo7p0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/l8P75mHo7p0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":312132}}

{"description":"CHUNG HA 청하 ‘Sparkling’ MV\n\nStream/ Download 'Sparkling' : https://ffm.to/chungha_barerare_pt1\nSubscribe CHUNG HA : https://www.youtube.com/c/CHUNGHA_OFFICIAL?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCHUNG HA The 2nd Studio Album [ Bare&Rare Pt.1 ] ‘Sparkling’\n\n“You make me sparkle, I’ll be your sparkle” is like the relationship between Byulharang and me, shining on each other. As much as you’ve been waiting, let’s enjoy the ever more sparkling summer together. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! \n\n\"You make me sparkle, I'll be your sparkle\" 서로를 비춰주는 별하랑과 저의 관계 같아요~ 오래 기다려 주신 만큼 더욱더 반짝반짝한 여름 함께 보내요 진심으로 늘 고맙습니다! \n\nThis fetching piece features sound like a refreshing soda pop, with its identity of hyper-vibe on top of a fast BPM around 160. Like the first sip of an ice cold drink on a hot summer day, the song expresses the clear and cool feeling of a cold and tangy pop. The fast mood could easily seem as light but by capturing the fast mood with Chung Ha’s strong voice, this cool and sparkle track was completed. The arpeggio of the analog synthesizer achieves harmony with the retro but trendy drumline, and by adding in the electric guitar, the chorus also realizes a tough but witty rich sound. And Chung Ha’s chameleonic changes in emotions corresponding with the lyrics can be a key point of this song. Like the lyrics, “You make me sparkle”, “I’ll be your sparkle”, Chung Ha’s ‘Sparkling’ will glitter up our summer moments. \n\n160대의 빠른 BPM 위에 하이퍼 바이브를 아이덴티티로, 탄산처럼 시원한 사운드가 매력적인 곡이다. 무더운 여름날 시원한 음료를 마시는 첫 모금처럼, 차갑고 알싸하게 톡 쏘는 청량한 감성을 표현했다. 또 자칫 가볍게 느껴질 수 있는 빠른 무드를 청하의 단단한 보컬이 잡아주어 쿨하면서도 Sparkle 한 트랙을 완성했다. 아날로그 신디사이저의 아르페지오가 레트로하면서도 트렌디한 드럼라인과 조화를 이루며, 코러스 역시 일렉 기타를 가미해 터프하면서도 재치 있는 다채로운 사운드를 구현했다. 또 노랫말에 맞게 카멜레온처럼 바뀌는 청하의 감성과 감정 표현도 이 곡의 Key point가 될 수 있다.  \"네가 나를 반짝거리게 해\", \"내가 너의 빛이 될게\"라는 Sparkling의 가사처럼, 청하의 ‘Sparkling’은 우리들의 여름 그 순간순간을 반짝반짝 빛나게 장식한다.\n\n\n[ CHUNG HA 'Sparkling' Credits ]\n\nLyrics by BXN, CHUNG HA\nComposed by BXN, Prime Time\nArranged by BXN\n\nDrums Performed by Hangsuk Jwa\nEP Performed by Gilbeom Lee\nGuitar Performed by Moohyuk Byun\nBackground Vocals by Ashley Alisha, CHUNG HA\nVocal Directed by BXN, Fuxxy\n\nRecorded by Jung Eunkyeng @ Ingrid Studio\nDigital Editing by Jung Eunkyeng, Yang Yung Eun @ Ingrid Studio\nMixed by DRK (Assist.

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! a bit of an experimental video here, but i hope you guys like it... \n\nHave you ever wondered why you always get lost in IKEA? Or why you can't leave Sephora without a hand full of lipstick swatches? Or why you just love hanging out at Target? I was curious... so I decided to do some research on how different retail stores manipulate you into spending more time at their stores, interacting with their products more, and therefore, spending more of you hard earned cash at their shops. We explored different tactics that Ikea, Target, Sephora, and Ulta use to lure customers in & keep them there until they make a purchase!

{"description":"The 2023 Acura Integra Elite A-Spec MT (~$46,280 in Canada as specced, $ in the US) is finally back after a long 15 year wait. To blend sportiness with comfortability, Acura have included a limited slip differential and adaptive dampers to compliment their 1.5L turbo four cylinder. However, for the price this trim commands, it’s put into some competitive territory among FWD cars. It also has to compete with its more affordable younger brother, the Civic SI - which comes very well specced here in Canada. Thomas and James spend some time with the new Integra to see how it stands out among the crowd, and if it is worth the jump up from the delightful Civic. We hope you enjoy the episode!
