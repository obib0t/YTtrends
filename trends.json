A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe‚Äôve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we‚Äôre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 We have COVID & Other News\n01:55 Hike - Nature‚Äôs Not Cooperating \n03:40 What's Next\n07:05 All Our Stuff\n09:07 Repair the Line Driver\n16:08 COVID RAT Test \n18:09 Largest Marina in the Southern Hemisphere \n22:33 Replace the Traveler Line\n26:45 The Last Boat Project Complete \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n¬© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"Last Boat Project As Owners","duration":1681,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220612","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyEeq0yzfXM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UyEeq0yzfXM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":175965}}

After being home for about 1 week, Chase did say he actually liked the place and wanted to go back.  Shawn wonders if the show is always the same and he wants to check it out again but us other 4 would not need to ever go back to this hotel although it is cool and I think worth doing it once if you 1. like cosplay 2. like Starwars 3. like roleplay and 4. don't mind subjecting your digestive system to LOADS nd LOADS of food coloring. :)  but definitely watch our RECAP review at the end of the vid.\n\n\nüìöFGTeeV NY Times Best Selling Books:\n#1 FGTeev Into the Game ‚û° https://amzn.to/3lBoPnB\n#2 FGTeeV Saves the World ‚û° https://amzn.to/3laHoyA\n& FGTeeV Game Break‚û° https://amzn.to/2T5QmRX\n\nüéÆFGTeeV Games/Apps:\nü¶çAPE CHASE ‚û° http://smarturl.it/ApeChase\nüîäSOUND BOARD ‚û° http://smarturl.it/soundboard\nüßÅGOOZY ‚û° http://smarturl.it/goozy","title":"We Slept in Outer Space & Betrayed the Space People!

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n #travel #travelvlog #sailing\n\n00:00 moving onto a sailboat!\n01:17 who are Riley and Elayna?\n02:15 taking over their boat for 24 hours!\n03:47 world‚Äôs best toothpaste üòÅ\n04:42 FULL TOUR of La Vagabonde ‚õµÔ∏è\n09:42 Van life vs boat life?\n10:25 Can we sail alone?!üò±\n14:40 Lifting the anchor!\n16:29 hoisting the SAILS\n25:31 sunset beach bonfire üî•\n26:27 learning to free dive and spearfish\n27:19 driving the dingy in the dark ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","title":"24 HOURS LIVING ON A SAIL BOAT (with sailing La Vagabonde)","duration":1762,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220611","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIY4PSilhb4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uIY4PSilhb4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":704842}}

The Mandalorian was the first big streaming hit for Disney Plus and is now paving the way for a TON of other Star Wars projects, as well as serving as a launching pad for some of them. \n\nThe Mandalorian definitely raises a few questions though. Like how many side quests is Mando trying to complete? Is anything a serious threat when his armor makes him practically invincible? Why did Moff Gideon kill his own men and give up his advantage? Why do the bad guys have a sensitive info terminal that lets you use it if you just have a face? Is everything about the Skywalkers, in the end?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to The Mandalorian!

{"description":"Hey guys, it‚Äôs time to get real for a moment. When I made the last video about the theoretical FNAF ARG, I did not expect the response it generated.

We need to talk about that video, ARGs, and making sure no one gets hurt for a YouTube video or video game mystery.
