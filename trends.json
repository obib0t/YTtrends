{"description":"[LYRICS BELOW] \"To Be a Man\" is making an IMPACT. I truly believe there are millions more to touch with this song. I travelled to Nashville to complete this and had the pleasure of working with the legend Darius Rucker. I'm still in shock. Share this with everyone and anyone and let's make an impact with music FOR THE PEOPLE spread BY THE PEOPLE. Somebody out there needs this. Love y'all...Thank you. \n\nClick here to listen:\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/tbam\n\n\nFollow DAX: @thatsdax\nDirected by: Logan Meis \nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#ToBeAMan #Dax #Dariusrucker #masculinity #manhood #manosphere #masculine #men #traditionalman #remix \n\n\nLyrics:\n\nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road, and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not about how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nBeing a man is what you make it\nyou can’t always live up to expectations\nYou try to please everybody while you struggle so you fake it and end up out of balance compromising situations \nAs a good man\nA do what he should man\nA give everything he has and do everything he could man\nYou might find yourself feeling all alone\nInside a house you built that you don’t recognize as home\nAnd that’s what my daddy told me\nAnd i’ll tell my son the same\nNow that I’m older I relate and I actually feel his pain\nHe never cried\nHe might of lied but he did not complain \nAnd he said son one day you’ll have to do the same\nI get emotional when I stop I think and I look around\nbeyond the county lines of my small town\nI think about all the men out there who feel like I do now \nWho are screaming on the inside but won’t ever make a sound\n \nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not bout how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nDon’t give up, keep fightin’\nAs a man our son(sun) is our horizon\nAnd our father’s actions play a role\nAnd we end up like ‘em\nSo they can’t let us see them hurt\n‘Cause we’ll embody what they do\nAnd start a generational curse\n No wonder most men are so depressed\nAll the things that they can’t express\nThey go to war \nget thrown on the shelf\nThen go back to war with their mental health\nThen grab that bottle and ask for help\nTry to pull themselves out of h*ll\nThen fall back down and then realize that they gon’ have to do it themselves\n \nIt’s the circle of life\nAs a man you provide\nThey don’t know what you’re worth ‘til the day that you die\nAnd that’s when they start cryin’\nThen move on to a man to confide in\n \nThat’s why we feel\nWe can’t hide ourselves\nWe don’t expect you to understand\nWe just hope we can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and you don’t care about what we know\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n \nThat home\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. This is the most excited I've ever felt about a collab. It was absolutely legendary to work with Darius Rucker.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread and create healthy conversation. 2023 IS NOT OVER!! SO MUCH MORE ON THE WAY!!! I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout life.

{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. \n\nAs a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history. \n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT \nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n \nVideo Director: Oliver Murray\nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton\nOriginal score: Paul Englishby\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists\nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup\nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter\n\nStream The Beatles:\n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Appl...\n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify\n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Amaz...\n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora\n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal\n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer\n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouT...\n \nFollow The Beatles:\n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com\n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"Now And Then – The Last Beatles Song (Short Film Trailer)","duration":35,"channel_id":"UCc4K7bAqpdBP8jh1j9XZAww","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgFTpwB_uII","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KgFTpwB_uII/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1366908}}

It's not just a dog house; it's a statement of the bond we share with our pets, blending comfort, luxury, and a dog's dream living space. But there's more! While we were immersed in this unique pet home construction, my sister took on a heartfelt task: giving our dog the most unforgettable day, filled with fun visits to his favorite spots like the local dog park and pet store, ensuring every moment was packed with happiness, play, and of course, his favorite treats. This is more than a typical 'building a dog house' scenario; it's a blend of creativity, luxury living for pets, and a celebration of the human-dog bond that viewers searching for dog care, luxury pet living, and epic DIY projects will not want to miss. We've tackled every challenge with determination, driven by the goal to see that wagging tail go into overdrive. Wait until you see the grand reveal at the end of this journey, capturing the priceless moment my dog sets paws into his luxury mansion for the first time. For anyone who loves dogs, enjoys creative pet care content, and believes in pampering their furry friends, this video is a must-watch. This was tricky to make, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I love dogs!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Take a Tour of The Most Luxurious Dog Houses Ever | The Dodo, But I Spent $3,000 Building a Doghouse with a POOL, But I Spent $20,000 Building a Dog House, But I BUILT My DOG Her DREAM House, But Building a HEATED DOG HOUSE for Canadian Winters, But Rescue Abandoned Puppies Build House Craft Jurassic world, But SURPRISING MY FRIENDS WITH MY NEW PUPPY, But I BUILT A $25,000 DREAM DOG HOUSE, But 15 Most Luxurious Dog Houses in The World or any other video like Drew Builds Stuff, The Dodo, House Technology, Alexa Rivera, The Finest, Keeley, Ben Azelart, Brent Rivera, Modustrial Maker, Unspeakable, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

Now you have the chance to make yourself at home in Africa’s finest futuristic masterpiece, where urban living blends with nature and time stands still.\n‍\nThis sculptural home captures the zeitgeist of Hollywood’s jet-set era, drawing every bit of allure and drama out of its 270-degree vistas of the Atlantic Seaboard.\nSpread over four levels (accessed via two elevators or a spiral staircase), this home in Cape Town’s most desirable address is perfect for gatherings of friends and families with teens. It has entertainment areas aplenty; an extensive home spa with an indoor heated swimming pool, sauna, steam room, and Jacuzzi; a home theatre; a home relaxation pavilion worthy of James Bond, with a sunken bar, barbecue areas, and rim-flow swimming pool; digital-games set-up; large open-plan living area with uninterrupted ocean views, long dining table, sleek kitchen-cum-bar area (plus a behind-the-scenes prep kitchen), all of which flow onto the lawn, outdoor barbecue area and the pavilion. The luxurious bedroom suites on the top floor are private sanctuaries, each with panoramic views and total privacy. Two separate bedroom pods above the entertainment pavilion are perfect for guests seeking extra independence.’’\n\nEnes: https://www.instagram.com/enesyilmazer/\nEnes on Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@enesyilmazerla\nMikey’s Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/ayersworld/\n\nCamera Gear used in the Video and Edit:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/enesyilmazer?listId=1OXA45Y91M6J7\n\nMy favorite books:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/enesyilmazer?listId=2XTUW13ZX2HL7\n\nRoyalty-free music we use in our videos:\nEpidemic (Free 30 day trial): https://bit.ly/3GRsjtl\nArtlist (2 Extra Months Free): https://bit.ly/3p2k9YZ\n\nStock Footage: https://bit.ly/3E1QxiB\nMotion Graphics: https://bit.ly/3skGrqX\n\nOnline course I used to get my Real Estate License:\nhttps://trk.realestateexpress.com/?a=13808&c=158&p=r&s1=\n\n#MansionTour #ModernMansion #LuxuryHomeTour #SouthAfrica #CapeTown #IronManHouse\n\nCreated by Enes Yilmazer - @EnesYilmazer\nFilmed by @AyersWorld , @Ermanalkis , Joe Russ\nEdited by @Create.james , @AyersWorld, @Jaysonk0312 , @Luis__f\n\nTime Codes:\n00:00 Introduction\n02:44 Main Floor & Great Room\n04:52 Specs & Kitchen \n06:57 Dining Room & Backyard\n09:31 The Design\n11:23 Backyard & Infinity Edge Pool\n14:08 Pool Deck & Bar\n15:33 Pool House\n18:02 Entry & Garage \n21:15 Bar & Screening Room\n22:13 Indoor Pool & Spa\n23:21 Glass Bridge & 2 Guest Suites\n25:12 Guest Living Room & Kitchen\n27:22 The Region\n29:00 Office & JR Primary Bedroom\n31:06 Primary Bedroom\n33:57 Sunset Tour\n35:05 - Night Tour\n36:44 Outro","title":"Touring the IRON MAN House!","duration":2240,"channel_id":"UCHWbZM3BIGgZksvXegx_h3w","author":"Enes Yilmazer","date":"20231023","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1t8Orjt7lk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1t8Orjt7lk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1083996}}

{"description":"Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton’s best weekend of 2023 ended in the worst possible outcome. Their strongest challenge against Red Bull and Max Verstappen yet ended in a disqualification for a rare breach of a near-30-year-old rule - with Ferrari falling foul of this as well. \nRed Bull was checked, hadn’t made the same mistake - and therefore Verstappen’s victory stood. Conversely Hamilton was stripped of his second place at the United States GP just a few hours after chasing Verstappen closely in his upgraded Mercedes in easily his and the team’s most competitive showing of the season, while Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc got excluded from sixth place at the same time. \nTheir cars breached the same technical regulation that refers to the thickness of the plank assembly under the car, with a minimum thickness of 9mm accepted after a competitive session due to wear.\nIt put a dampener on a much improved weekend for Mercedes even if there were a few factors behind dominant world champion Verstappen almost suffering a rare defeat. \n\n00:00 Exclusions\n01:57 How Ferrari and Mercedes got caught out\n03:26 Why only four cars were checked\n05:28 How Red Bull avoided trouble\n07:55 What about Mercedes' upgrade?\n\nSubscribe: http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe\nWebsite: http://the-race.com/\nTwitter: @wearetherace\nInstagram: @wearetherace\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/wearetherace\nPodcasts: http://the-race.com/podcasts\n\nThanks for watching - please like, share and comment, please also hit subscribe to show your support so we'll keep doing what we're doing.\n\nhttps://www.the-race.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/wearetherace\n\n#f1 #f1news #USGP #f12023 #mercedes #ferrari #redbull #lewishamilton #charlesleclerc #maxverstappen #hamilton #leclerc #verstappen #fia #rules #excluded #disqualified #disqualification #austin #texas #formula1 #formulaone #grandprix #therace","title":"How Red Bull avoided USGP error that got Hamilton and Leclerc excluded","duration":605,"channel_id":"UCaTxfj0BzL-MaCy-YUqPRoQ","author":"THE RACE","date":"20231023","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBAhkdSsVOQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wBAhkdSsVOQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGBMgVSh_MA8=&rs=AOn4CLBEu3Wzc6A1P1CsTlPTT3Y51Zv9gw","content":{"View count":660194}}
