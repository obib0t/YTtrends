Renowned since their inception for electrifying performances, The Rose quickly became one of Korea's most sought-after groups delivering a series of critically acclaimed albums that resonated with fans worldwide. In 2019, three of the band members temporarily went on hiatus to fulfill their mandatory military service obligations, during which WOOSUNG pursued a successful solo career, releasing captivating albums and embarking on sold-out world tours.\n\nIn a moment of sheer joy for their devoted fans, The Rose reunited during one of Woosung's performances in South Korea in 2022. This reunion paved the way for their first full-length album HEAL, which was inspired by the transformative power of music and the stories shared by both their fans and themselves. HEAL soared to #4 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, while their accompanying HEAL Together World Tour drew an overwhelming crowd of over 90,000 attendees.\n\nNow, with their highly anticipated second full-length album DUAL, The Rose takes their music to new heights. Building upon the emotional honesty and vulnerability showcased in HEAL, this latest offering explores the profound concept of 'balance.' Seamlessly merging light and dark elements, The Rose masterfully weaves emotions and sounds, capturing the dualistic essence that defines their music. \n\nDriven by unwavering dedication to their fans and the unbreakable bond of their friendship, The Rose continues to push artistic boundaries, captivating audiences worldwide with their soul-stirring music and unforgettable performances.\n\n더 로즈(The Rose)는 대한민국 인디 록 밴드이다. 보컬과 기타의 김우성(Woosung), 보컬 및 여러 악기를 다루는 박도준(Dojoon), 베이스의 이재형(Jaehyeong), 그리고 드럼의 이하준(Hajoon)으로 이루어진 이들은 2017년 데뷔, 화려한 라이브 실력으로 전세계 팬들에게 수많은 찬사를 받으며 대한민국에서 가장 인기 있는 밴드 중 하나로 떠올랐다. 2019년에 김우성은 솔로 앨범을 발매하고 성공적인 활동을 펼치며 솔로 월드 투어를 성황리에 마쳤다.\n\n2022년, 더 로즈는 3년 간의 공백기를 끝으로 첫 정규 앨범 ‘HEAL’로 컴백했다. 팬들과 함께 만들었던 이야기들과 음악의 힘에서 영감을 받아 제작된 'HEAL'은 빌보드의 히트시커스 차트에서 4위를 기록하였고, 'HEAL Together World Tour’는 9만 명이 넘는 관객들과 함께했다.\n\n이어서 두 번째 정규 앨범 'DUAL'로 돌아온 더 로즈는 한층 더 성장된 더 로즈의 음악적 스펙트럼을 보여준다. 'HEAL'에서 보여준 감정의 정직함을 이번 앨범에서 '균형'이라는 개념으로 탐구한다. 빛과 어둠의 사이에서, 더 로즈는 여러 사운드를 섞어내며 그들의 음악을 정의하는 이중성을 포착했다. 더 로즈는 예술적 경계를 끊임없이 넓혀가며 영혼을 뒤흔드는 음악과 잊지 못할 라이브 공연으로 전세계 음악 팬들을 사로잡고 있다.\n\n#TheRose #더로즈 #backtome","title":"The Rose (더로즈) – Back To Me | Official Video","duration":233,"channel_id":"UClcbcYLmTpDeuK1EFeqh5uA","author":"The Rose","date":"20230721","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuzLp9gDcwY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fuzLp9gDcwY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3811707}}

{"description":"Step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Interstellar!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g\n\nChristopher Nolan has made a name for himself making intellectual mind-bendy movies with films like Memento, Inception and Tenet. Let’s just say it, the dude is a little obsessed with time. He’s one of the few filmmakers making truly “epic” movies, and it’s really cool when you can understand them.\n\nInterstellar definitely raises some questions though. Like why doesn’t anyone seem to care about Tom? Why did they decide to go down to that time dilation planet first? Why did they try to collect that worthless data? Why was there a Matt Damon jumpscare on the second planet? Why did Tom name his kid Coop Cooper? Why did Cooper send the same “stay” message that he knew did not get him to stay?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Interstellar!\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N5nQPNCNkg\n\nThe Flash Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzlSBBVpbS4\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PitchMeeting\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/","title":"Interstellar Pitch Meeting","duration":366,"channel_id":"UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g","author":"Pitch Meeting","date":"20230720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhHjhdwD8gk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/xhHjhdwD8gk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":898586}}

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.\n\n---","title":"Chelsea 5-0 Wrexham | Extended Highlights | Chelsea FC USA Tour 2023","duration":608,"channel_id":"UCU2PacFf99vhb3hNiYDmxww","author":"Chelsea Football Club","date":"20230720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg8rrb2IxlM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dg8rrb2IxlM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2419835}}
