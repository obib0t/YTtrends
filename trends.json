We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n #travel #travelvlog #firstclass #jetblue \n\n0:00 2 reasons we‚Äôre excited about today!‚úàÔ∏è\n1:25 why we‚Äôre flying first class\n2:30 how we have airport lounge accessü™™\n3:35 boarding our first class flight!ü•Ç\n4:52 first class plane layout\n5:24 AG1 is the BEST\n6:50 first class seat review!\n9:48 meal serviceüç¥\n14:50 Boston to Nassau, Bahamas\n16:00 Our ‚Äúhistory‚Äù with Riley and Elayna‚Ä¶\n17:13 Nassau to Marsh Harbor, Bahamas\n18:08 moving onto La Vagabond!\n19:07 our awkward first impression‚õµÔ∏èüòÇ","title":"FLYING FIRST CLASS ACROSS AMERICA (6 Hours in JetBlue Mint)","duration":1264,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220606","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxYHX3hXU_4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/pxYHX3hXU_4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":526516}}

{"description":"Season 4 of Stranger Things has really upped the ante, and proved itself as one of the show's best seasons. Creating a show as big as Stranger Things is no easy task. There was a lot of work going on behind the scenes to bring the show to life. Between recreating Southern California in another state, to coordinating massive scenes with crazy stunts, everyone gave a hundred and ten percent to help create this season. That being said, there was also a lot of goofing off and shenanigans between the cast members. Millie Bobby Brown and Noah Schnaap in particular had a lot of hilarious stories about their on set experiences while filming. Can you guess which one of them got pelted by water balloons?\n\nCreating the right look and aesthetic was extremely important for the Stranger Things team. Vecna is one of the coolest monsters we have seen on the show, and a ton of hard work went into creating his look. The prosthetics team had their hands full, as they applied a whopping amount of prosthetics. It‚Äôs almost hard to believe how many individual pieces were applied to actor Jamie Campbell. It‚Äôs no wonder he spent so long in the makeup chair!\n\nSometimes the best behind the scenes moments have nothing to do with the show, and come purely from the chemistry all the actors have with each other. Like which cast members competed in a fruit by the foot challenge?\n\nWhich behind the scenes moment from Stranger Things season 4 is your favorite?

Years before he would become the tyrannical President of Panem, 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) is the last hope for his fading lineage, a once-proud family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With the 10th annual Hunger Games fast approaching, the young Snow is alarmed when he is assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), the girl tribute from impoverished District 12. But, after Lucy Gray commands all of Panem‚Äôs attention by defiantly singing during the reaping ceremony, Snow thinks he might be able to turn the odds in their favor. Uniting their instincts for showmanship and newfound political savvy, Snow and Lucy Gray‚Äôs race against time to survive will ultimately reveal who is a songbird, and who is a snake.","title":"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023 Movie) - Reveal","duration":88,"channel_id":"UCJ6nMHaJPZvsJ-HmUmj1SeA","author":"Lionsgate Movies","date":"20220605","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfGcH2T53XY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GfGcH2T53XY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":326402}}

{"description":"Get Honey for FREE today ‚ñ∏ https://joinhoney.com/moriah\nHoney finds coupons with one click. Thanks to Honey for sponsoring!\n\nWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n\n_________FAQs__________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 27 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\nCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

So I decided to do some research and development to see if I could improve it's efficiency. From my research, increasing the number of fan blades from 4 to 8 yielded an increase of 19% volume of airflow. So I set about building a better fan. Instead of splitting the rotor and inserting blades made of bark into it, I made spokes from split cane to hold the blades leaving the rotor intact. This increased the longevity of the rotor as well as the spokes being heavier contributing more momentum, assisting the impeller in winding back in the other direction after each rotation. Instead of bark being used to for the blades, simple (and easier to find) folded leaves formed the blades. These, being flexible, are less likely to break against the walls of the housing as stiff bark does. Finally, a lid was added to the housing to make maintenance easier. The new blower works better than the old one with more airflow occurring. I experimented with different numbers of blades on the impeller (4,6 and 8). The more blades used, the slower the impeller can be spun to produce the same airflow. This makes it easier to operate as the users arms don't have to move as quickly, making it more ergonomic. This conservation of effort will be important in iron smelting later.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"kenobi is once again reaching out to qui gon jinn, his old master. I guess in these 10 years he hasn‚Äôt been able to reach him. Yoda‚Äôs training hasn‚Äôt gone too well I guess.\nas he hears voices of the past, like yoda telling him only pain will you find, qui gon‚Äôs plea to train anakin, reverberations of anakin on mustafaor, we see Vader being put together, really connecting the fact that anakin and vader are now the same person physically. obi wan can feel vader, and tells quigon that he is coming. \n\nAs Vader walks out of his chamber, which looks lke the same one from Rogue One, we get a beautiful shot of mustafar and his castle. For those new to star wars, this is the same place where he fought obi-wan and lost, burning alive. This is also where in the comics, he opened a portal beneath his castle to bring back his dead wife padme, which of course didn‚Äôt work as planned. check out the marvel darth vader comics and darth momin for more about that.\nVader sits atop his obsidian throne, as he orders Reva around. Where is he, he says, and we hear this is james earl jones iconic voice. I feel it could be perfected with some audio engineering like how luke skywalker‚Äôs voice was made in the mandalorian, being completely computer generated.\nHe tells her that kenobi is all that matters, not the grand inquisitor. She clearly has lied and told Vader that Kenobi killed the GI, to which of course Vader will realize that this is impossible once he fights Kenobi and sees he‚Äôs pathetic.\n\nHe explains he knows what she wants, to be the grand inquisitor. If she brings him Kenobi, he will award her the promotion. If she fails, he‚Äôll terminate her. So Vader has definitely given the go ahead to the Empire to track Kenobi down, and notify him once they have him in near sight. Vader ends communication and gets up like a robot, his lightsaber hanging from his belt, emitter side up, just like the original trilogy. \n\n\nAs They land on Mapuzo, a mining system, we see a lifter droid and an R5 unit. R5 was the droid in a new hope that had the bad motivator, which was replaced by R2D2 to Luke Skywalker and Uncle Owen. This isn‚Äôt the same R5 unit, just a R5 unit.\n\nAs Obi-Wan looks out in to the distance, he sees dark side Anakin in his jedi robes. this is the first time we see Anakin played by hayden christensen in anything since revenge of the sith. I had to do a double take, I couldn‚Äôt believe it was him.\n\nThey enter a room that many Jedi have been in, this is a safe house, called the path. It all leads to Jabim, where they give the force sensitives captured by the empire, new identities and free them. As Leia asks what happens to them, it‚Äôs revealed no one ever sees them again. So I can say what happens to the is that the empire takes them in, and tries to convert them to the dark side. As Kenobi reveals carving on the walls from Quinlan Voss. This is amazing. We haven‚Äôt heard of Quinlan in forever, no one knew if he lived or died from Order 66. Quinlan was a powerful Jedi during the clone wars, he helped obi-wan on many missions and had a unique ability shared with Cal Kestis called psychometry.\n\nI think this is Hayden in the suit. \n\nKenobi runs away, and he‚Äôs stopped to see Vader infront of him. Igniting his crimson red lightsaber. Obi-Wan wants no part of this and runs away. Finally igniting his saber as Vader tells him he can‚Äôt hide forever.\n\nWe get the best line where Kenobi says what have you become? \nVader puases and says I am what you made me.\n\nThey fight and it doesn‚Äôt look good for Kenobi at all, Vader overpowers him and he‚Äôs literally toying with him. 10 years have led to this moment, where Vader wants KEnobi to suffer. He‚Äôs also extremely cautious, as in this 10 years he‚Äôs had time to reflect on everything, and realizes his loss could have been avoided had he not been so arrogant and quick to make decisions. Rageful Vader is learning about Kenobi, he‚Äôs more tactful, more experienced, and more patient, waiting for the right time to unleash. \n\nReva finds the safe house.\n\nVader lifts Kenobi with the dark side of the force, choking him, spilling flammable material, as Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber. \nIgniting the substance, Vader throws Obi-Wan into the fire, dragging him with the force, paying him back to how Obi-Wan left him on mustafar, burning alive. Telling him this is only the beginning for the pain he‚Äôs about to feel.\nVader clearly wants Obi-Wan to die very slowly, only after suffering to Vader‚Äôs enjoyment. That‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt go all out, he‚Äôs savouring the moment. Playing with his food before he eats. As Storm troopers come, Vader orders them to bring him, when one is shot by the lady helping obi-wan, and she explodes a cannister into massive flames. Vader watches Kenobi being picked up by the loader droid who i think is wrecker or Rex, and we see the flames in his lenses. Symbolizing his rage and his past with obi-wan, the fires that turned him into who he is today.","title":"OBI-WAN KENOBI EPISODE 3 BREAKDOWN VADER","duration":1322,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20220601","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdtsSdlpa_Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OdtsSdlpa_Q/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1151108}}

Therefore, in this video I traveled to MrBeast Private island and spent two days searching Jeff before we eventually found the treasure chest! You won‚Äôt believe what was inside the chest! It was ridiculous! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way.
