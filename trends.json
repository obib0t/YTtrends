I knew one day I would have to visit...\n\nWhen the word Darien started appearing in the news in recent years by way of the migrant crises I decided that now was the time to explore it for myself. And so myself and my good friend @TimmyKarter headed north from Medellin in search of a way across the infamous jungle, avoiding cartel and bandits, injury and tropical diseases, on an adventure with migrants from all over the world where national laws don't apply. Only the laws of the jungle.\n\nJoin us as we enter...the Darien.","title":"I Crossed The World's Deadliest Jungle: Darien Gap","duration":2991,"channel_id":"UCxDZs_ltFFvn0FDHT6kmoXA","author":"bald and bankrupt","date":"20231111","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aswvkdCpZYc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aswvkdCpZYc/hqdefault.webp?v=654e2704","content":{"View count":1216441}}

{"description":"🚧Things are getting messy🚧\n\nDisney and Pixar's #InsideOut2 is coming to theaters June 2024 with brand new emotions!\n\nThe little voices inside Riley’s head know her inside and out—but next summer, everything changes when Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” introduces a new Emotion: Anxiety. According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” said Mann. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust.

Craft the everyday food, fuel, weapons, ammo and space suit upgrades you’ll need to survive out here in the vastness of the cosmos.\n\nIn space there is no up or down! Expand your base in any direction for the most efficient layout. Once you are equipped with the necessary fuel and a warp drive, you’ll be free to explore other sectors and continue your mission.\n\nCircumnavigate tiny asteroids, fly between abandoned outposts, and board derelict spaceships as they orbit the system. Take caution, however, and remember to keep your jetpack fuel topped up–you’ll need it to get back to your Space Rig safe and sound!\n\nEach salvage zone is a procedurally generated, dynamic, and ever-changing open world.\n\nYou are an employee for the galaxy’s number one waste disposal firm, stranded far away from home with a mission to clean the galaxy from the remains of a galactic war.Space trash is your main resource. Whether it is salvaged debris floating in space, advanced and rare tech from wrecked ships, or scavenged goods from asteroid surfaces, you’ll want to snatch it all up!\n\nRecycle and refine it to produce valuable goods that will net a tidy sum on the Trash Exchange, and spend it to upgrade your kit.\n\nYou’re not alone amid the wreckage. Alien bots patrol most sectors of space nowadays and they’ll be drawn to you as your operation expands.\n\nYou’ll need a steady aim, impeccable defenses, and an upgraded armory to protect your Space Rig from the dangers of these foes. Survival depends on your ability to defend yourself!\n\n...and more!\nWe'll be adding more and more to Space Trash Scavenger, so be sure to wishlist and follow for updates!

We also now know how this sets up the future of the MCu and a rough idea of where it could all be going for the upcoming films. I won't be covering The Marvels ending incase you haven't seen it but later on we might give some theories for Deadpool 3 and Avengers Secret Wars.\n\nThat will all be at the end of the video though and last week saw Loki getting the band back together to travel back to the loom in order to stop it from self destructing.\n\nThat takes us into this episode in which we get a lot of major revelations. For that final time I'm gonna need you to hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe because we still have a lot of comic content coming soon. With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into The Loki Season 2 Finale.\n\n-\n\nNow as always we begin with the marvel studios logo however here somethings different.

{"description":"128 seconds of Masters of the Air. The 9-part series event premieres January 26. https://apple.co/_MastersOfTheAir\n\nFrom Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman - the producers of Band of Brothers and The Pacific. During World War II, airmen risk their lives with the 100th Bomb Group, a brotherhood forged by courage, loss, and triumph.\n\nBased on Donald L. Miller’s book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff, “Masters of the Air” follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the “Bloody Hundredth”) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich, is at the heart of “Masters of the Air.” Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.\n\nThe series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle and Nate Mann, who are joined by Raff Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, \"Masters of the Air\" is executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Television, and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman for Playtone. Amblin Television’s Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey co-executive produce alongside Playtone’s Steven Shareshian. In addition to writing, Orloff co-executive produces. Graham Yost also serves as co-executive producer. Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees and Tim Van Patten serve as directors.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

{"description":"And I don't hate it! As someone that's had a sad habit of making Why (Pixar Movie) Concerns Me as of late, it's nice to see a new Pixar trailer that wholeheartedly has me onboard! Now with the introduction of the emotion Anxiety, it could be seen as a little bit simple, when surely they could fall under Fear or something. But perhaps simplicity is just what we need for this sequel reaching in to explaining the child's mind. And with the announcement news of details like other emotions Embarrassment, Ennui and Envy, it looks to be quite a grand little story to be told as Riley reaches her teenage years. And perhaps with a movie like this, we can finally see a revival on Disney Pixar's front.

However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina’s crosshairs. As Cady sets to take down the group’s apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli’i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.\n\nConnect with #MeanGirls online:\nOfficial Site: https://meangirls.com\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@meangirls\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/meangirls/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MeanGirls\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meangirls/\n\nSign up for EXCLUSIVE content & updates: https://www.meangirls.com/signup/\n\nParamount Pictures Corporation (PPC), a major global producer and distributor of filmed entertainment, is a unit of Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB, VIA), home to premier global media brands that create compelling television programs, motion pictures, short-form content, apps, games, consumer products, social media experiences, and other entertainment content for audiences in more than 180 countries.\n \nConnect with Paramount Pictures online:\nOfficial Site: http://www.paramount.com/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@paramountpics\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/ParamountPics\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/paramountpics\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Paramount\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Paramount\n\n#MeanGirls #TinaFey #ReneéRapp #AngourieRice #ChristopherBriney #Auli'iCravalho #JaquelSpivey #Avantika #BebeWood #JonHamm #BusyPhilipps #JennaFischer #TimMeadows #AshleyPark","title":"Mean Girls | Official Trailer (2024 Movie)","duration":126,"channel_id":"UCF9imwPMSGz4Vq1NiTWCC7g","author":"Paramount Pictures","date":"20231108","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFtdbEgnUOk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fFtdbEgnUOk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4427105}}

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more.
