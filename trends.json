{"description":"WELCOME TO BARBIE LAND, did you bring your rollerblades? 🌟 #BarbieTheMovie only in theaters July 21.\n\nTo live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you’re a Ken.\n\nFrom Oscar-nominated writer/director Greta Gerwig (“Little Women,” “Lady Bird”) comes “Barbie,” starring Oscar-nominees Margot Robbie (“Bombshell,” “I, Tonya”) and Ryan Gosling (“La La Land,” “Half Nelson”) as Barbie and Ken, alongside America Ferrera (“End of Watch,” the “How to Train Your Dragon” films), Kate McKinnon (“Bombshell,” “Yesterday”), Michael Cera (“Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” “Juno”), Ariana Greenblatt (“Avengers: Infinity War,” “65”), Issa Rae (“The Photograph,” “Insecure”), Rhea Perlman (“I’ll See You in My Dreams,” “Matilda”), and Will Ferrell (the “Anchorman” films, “Talladega Nights”). The film also stars Ana Cruz Kayne (“Little Women”), Emma Mackey (“Emily,” “Sex Education”), Hari Nef (“Assassination Nation,” “Transparent”), Alexandra Shipp (the “X-Men” films), Kingsley Ben-Adir (“One Night in Miami,” “Peaky Blinders”), Simu Liu (“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”), Ncuti Gatwa (“Sex Education”), Scott Evans (“Grace and Frankie”), Jamie Demetriou (“Cruella”), Connor Swindells (“Sex Education,” “Emma.”), Sharon Rooney (“Dumbo,” “Jerk”), Nicola Coughlan (“Bridgerton,” “Derry Girls”), Ritu Arya (“The Umbrella Academy”), Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter Dua Lipa and Oscar-winner Helen Mirren (“The Queen”).\n\nGerwig directed “Barbie” from a screenplay by Gerwig & Oscar nominee Noah Baumbach (“Marriage Story,” “The Squid and the Whale”), based on Barbie by Mattel. The film’s producers are Oscar nominee David Heyman (“Marriage Story,” “Gravity”), Robbie, Tom Ackerley and Robbie Brenner, with Michael Sharp, Josey McNamara, Ynon Kreiz, Courtenay Valenti, Toby Emmerich and Cate Adams serving as executive producers.\n\nGerwig’s creative team behind the camera included Oscar-nominated director of photography Rodrigo Prieto (“The Irishman,” “Silence,” “Brokeback Mountain”), six-time Oscar-nominated production designer Sarah Greenwood (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Anna Karenina”), editor Nick Houy (“Little Women,” “Lady Bird”), Oscar-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran (“Little Women,” “Anna Karenina”), visual effects supervisor Glen Pratt (“Paddington 2,” “Beauty and the Beast”), music supervisor George Drakoulias (“White Noise,” “Marriage Story”) and Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat (“The Shape of Water,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents a Heyday Films Production, a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Mattel Production, “Barbie.” The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and released in theaters only nationwide on July 21, 2023 and beginning internationally on July 19, 2023.","title":"Barbie | Teaser Trailer 2","duration":105,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab.

{"description":"Dwayne Johnson revealed in message from Hawaii that a live-action reimagining of Disney Animation’s 2016 hit feature film “Moana” is in development.\n \nThe new feature film is produced by Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia via their Seven Bucks Productions, and Beau Flynn via Flynn Picture Co. Executive producers include Auli‘i Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the 2016 film, and Scott Sheldon of Flynn Picture Co. Jared Bush and Samoan industry pro Dana Ledoux Miller will also take part in the production. Bush, who was a director and co-writer of Disney’s Oscar®-winning feature “Encanto” and a writer and co-director on Disney’s Oscar®-winning film “Zootopia,” wrote the screenplay for 2016’s “Moana.”\n \nLike its animated predecessor, the film will celebrate the islands, communities and traditions of Pacific Islanders as seen through the eyes of a young woman eager to pave her own path. Moana’s journey of self-discovery and reflection on the lives of her ancestors won hearts worldwide, as did her newfound friendship with an exiled demigod named Maui. \n \nJohnson, who plans to return to the fictional world to set sail with Moana, said, “I’m deeply humbled and overcome with gratitude to bring the beautiful story of Moana to the live action big screen. This story is my culture, and this story is emblematic of our people’s grace and warrior strength. I wear this culture proudly on my skin and in my soul, and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reunite with Maui, inspired by the mana and spirit of my late grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia, is one that runs very deep for me. I want to thank my partners at Disney for their strong commitment to this special endeavor, because there is no better world for us to honor the story of our people, our passion and our purpose than through the realm of music and dance, which is at the core of who we are as Polynesian people.”\n \nNative Hawaiian actor Cravalho, who helped shape Moana in the original film, said the beloved protagonist’s reach is sweeping. “She has had such a profound impact on how we think of Disney princesses,” she said. “Moana’s strength and perseverance are inspiring—to audiences around the world, to me and to everyone who helped bring her to life. I’m looking forward to sharing her story in a whole new way.”\n \nSean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production (Disney Live Action), said the film would join a successful lineup of live-action adaptations that include 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast,” 2019’s “Aladdin” and the highly anticipated live-action version of “The Little Mermaid,” opening May 26. “It’s still early, but the idea of working with these fantastic partners to tell such a meaningful story on a live-action canvas, particularly as we celebrate 100 years of storytelling at Disney, is thrilling,”said Bailey.\n \nWalt Disney Animation Studios’ “Moana” debuted in theaters on Nov. 23, 2016, grossing nearly $644 million in global box office. The title, which debuted on Disney+ with the streamer’s 2019 launch, is among the top 15 movies streamed in the United States in 2022. The film’s soundtrack, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Opetaia Foa’iand Mark Mancina, was lauded worldwide. Miranda won a GRAMMY® for best song written for visual media (“How Far I’ll Go”), and an Oscar® nomination for best achievement in music written for motion pictures – original song (“How Far I’ll Go”). In 2021, the “Moana” soundtrack broke a Billboard Soundtrack chart record for the amount of time spent at number one (52 weeks). Additionally, the film was nominated for an Academy Award (best animated feature film of the year), a BAFTA (best animated feature film) and a pair of Golden Globes® (best motion picture – animated and best original song (“How Far I’ll Go”).","title":"Live-Action Moana Announcement","duration":128,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20230403","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHXB-5woeHw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHXB-5woeHw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":506441}}

{"description":"This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World... this has never been done before.\n\nThis was one of the most incredible projects I have ever worked on.\n\nTwitter: @Dream\nInstagram: @DreamWasTaken\nSnapchat: @Dream\n\nIn this video, we coded a Minecraft mod that live translates languages through a voice chat above your character in Minecraft. It has fairly good accuracy and can translate most languages around the world. This mod allows you to play Minecraft, make jokes, and have fun with people that can't even speak your language.  \n\nLive voice translation has been being worked on by Google and other companies, and they provide API's for it.  Google glass , apple glasses, and other similar products have been talked about for years with mentions of live-translating interactions in real life. We thought about taking that, and applying it to gaming.\n\nI truly believe that this is the near future for all online games with voice chat, with being able to play and communicate with anyone from anywhere, breaking down the language barrier. I also believe that this is a cool glimpse into the future in real life. If a bunch of kids can do it at home in one of the biggest games in the world, a bunch of engineers and geniuses can make it happen in real life.\n\nIn this video there were plenty of languages, and I was able to laugh and joke with all of them. When testing this mod, I played with friends of mine that spoke different languages, and we were having so much fun playing together and laughing about how crazy it was that we could communicate with each other.\n\nThis has been being worked on for a while and I'm so happy to finally share it with everyone. There are some bugs still, and in this version a couple of the notable bugs were: Minecraft words being incorrectly translated, names being incorrectly translated, and your last word not showing up sometimes.\n\nWhenever this mod's bugs are fixed and it's features are added, I plan on releasing this to the public for free, and with open source so anyone can make any additions they want with ease. Depending on what API is used for transcribing/translations and how many people are being translated, it can be costly, so although the mod will be free from me, using it might require setup on your end.\n\nI am releasing an SMP, the \"United SMP\", which is going to feature creators from all around the world. Equal representation from the languages that are on it, with a mock EU-style committee to make decisions so there is not one owner. This will be launching hopefully later this month, and has 60 creators to start with, 10 of which will be English speaking, 50 of which will be from 5 other languages. Most of these people are people I never would have been able to collaborate with, or make jokes with, or share with my fans, so I am so excited to share our community with the world. There will be more details on my twitter about this, and I will be live streaming the server in the future.\n\nthank you guys for watching and supporting the channel to make stuff like this possible.","title":"This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World...","duration":1518,"channel_id":"UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w","author":"Dream","date":"20230403","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BZIxt07UNU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BZIxt07UNU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":3416748}}

{"description":"There's crazy, and then there's what @tavarish has gone and done! Freddy has bought the infamous flood damaged McLaren P1, and my goodness does he have his work cut out to bring this back to the road. Let's head over in his re-built 675LT to go check it out... Oh boy!\n\nI first visited Freddy when he had just bought the crash damaged 675LT, and in fact it had certainly seen better days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9kf5t5PWDA However, fast forward and it's had a total overhaul, been brough back to life, and has numerous totally unique features.\n\nObservant viewers will notice that unfortunately this 675LT has since rather blown up... to put it lightly. Hopefully it's easy enough to work out that this was filmed beforehand and held back to reveal the P1 once Freddy had taken the wraps off to the world! More about all of that on @tavarish's channel.\n\nHowever, today is all about the P1, the most infamous P1 in the world. The car that was destroyed by the hurricane in Florida last September, seem by millions in videos and images being battered around the owner's garage in flood water, sailing off down the street, and coming to a rest atop a toilet. Of course that was a devastating event and sadly many lost lives in the brutal weather, however it's Freddy's goal to get this car back on the road one day.\n\nWhen it comes to a rebuild project, it's safe to say that this must be the biggest undertaking ever seen in this space. Not only has the car been entirely submerged, but every body panel has taken a battering, and absolutely nothing works as it should.
