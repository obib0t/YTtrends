{"description":"Funny Marco welcomes Orlando Brown, an American actor, rapper and singer. He is best known for his roles as Cadet Kevin 'Tiger' Dunne in Major Payne, 3J Winslow in “Family Matters,” Max in “Two of a Kind,” Damey Wayne \"Waynehead\" in Waynehead, Sticky Webb in “The Proud Family,” Cornelius Fillmore in “Fillmore!,” Eddie Thomas in “That's So Raven,” and Frankie in “Eddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off.” \n \nIn this episode the antics and tension are felt immediately as the crew is late setting up and Orlando blows in the mic seeming to frustrate Marco who in turns starts interrogating Orlando about his experience working with Will Smith, which Orlando denies. Not one to take one word answers, Marco goes deep and asks Orlando about his past and if he has fumbled the bag. Orlando responds by saying he is all about love. As the interview continues Marco asks Orlando about his drip. The random questions from Marco seem to baffle and frustrate Orlando. Marco then asks the question on how Orlando feels about going from Disney to TMZ. Orlando responds that is part of the lifestyle of growing up under the spotlight. Orlando also says Marco owns the Shade Room and the Shade Room plays him. An argument starts with the crew as Orlando speaks in the camera to speak directly to The Shade Room. Marco then asks Orlando about Raven-Symone. Orlando calls Marco Raven and starts to sing the theme song to “That’s So Raven.” Marco then gets into Orlando’s rap career playing one of Orlando’s songs. Marco asks about his lyrics and Orlando talks about how Debbie Allen inspired him. Marco then shows Orlando a publicity shot of Orlando at Disney next to a mugshot. Orlando points out on his mugshot that he has a tattoo of Raven on his neck. Marco then asks Orlando about Mariah Carey for which Orlando says that her real name is Danielle and he would never sleep with his buddy Nick Cannon’s girl. The antics continue as Marco asks about Orlando’s high speed chase. Orlando gives a message to 50 Cent about being down. The producer comments that Orlando has a lifetime contract with Disney. Orlando vehemently denies the claim. Orlando claims Bill Cosby owns Disney and says R Kelly is guilty and he saw the tapes. As usual chaos ensues as Orlando seems patient but confused as he eats a snack. Orlando talks about the Straight Outta Compton feature that he was cut out of. Marco asks a question about Lil Bow Wow and Orlando makes the claim that Lil Bow Wow has “bomb ass pussy.”  \nThe crew is shocked at the comment but Marco stays professional. The crew is having problems as the sound man gets fired. Orlando starts to petition Lil Wayne’s manager Cortez Bryant, a guest in the crowd, for representation, making for an awkward moment. The random questions continue as Marco seems to be fed up.  \n \nExecutive Producers: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries\n \nDirector: Matt Ables\n \nDirector of Photography: Rashid “Cruz” Terry\n \nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco\n \nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Orlando Brown talks TMZ, Disney, Raven Simone, 50 Cent plea, DMs Mariah Carey, Lil Bow Wow + More","duration":1532,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH2yzHSliu0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YH2yzHSliu0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":286314}}

You'll also see things like popular Heizou Tazer team showcased, popular variation of Yelan and Heizou in a National team, Heizou damage going insane using Widsith weapon catalyst and MORE.\n\n0:00 What you can expect from this video\n0:21 Damage Potential & Skills Showcase \n4:23 Heizou Showcase, Teams & Builds\n9:34 Overall Thoughts, Should You Pull Heizou?\n\nShikanoin Heizou was released during 2.8 Genshin Impact update.\n\nGenshin Impact is an open-world gacha game that's available on PC, PS4, PS5 and mobile devices (iOS & Android).

{"description":"Today I was at the National Astronomy Meeting with 500 of my fellow astrophysicists and we were  all excited to see the first science images from the James Webb Space Telescope.

I love making videos about science with an unnatural level of enthusiasm. I like to focus on how we know things, not just what we know. And especially, the things we still don't know. If you've ever wondered about something in space and couldn't find an answer online - you can ask me! My day job is to do research into how supermassive black holes can affect the galaxies that they live in. In particular, I look at whether the energy output from the disk of material orbiting around a growing supermassive black hole can stop a galaxy from forming stars.\n\nhttp://drbecky.uk.com\nhttps://rebeccasmethurst.co.uk","title":"An astrophysicist's live reaction to the first JWST science images","duration":553,"channel_id":"UCYNbYGl89UUowy8oXkipC-Q","author":"Dr. Becky","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeEhUCAeac","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uZeEhUCAeac/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":259066}}

Grab a LIMITED EDITION GN Cyber Skeleton foil shirt on our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/limited-edition-foil-skeletal-cotton-t-shirt-with-pc-component-design - these will only be made once and will not be made again after.

Additionally, you can grab our toolkits, modmats, mouse mats, or other items on the store.\n\nThis video took us months of work to compile, document, and research. We had to coordinate with landlords, brokers, former employees, lawyers, and more to dig deep into the shady, scummy operation of Artesian Builds and its former CEO Noah Katz, whom we've heard has thrown around the word \"lawsuit\" when talking about us. We will never back down from sharing the full story with consumers, especially when so many have been hurt by one company's actions.\n\nThis deep dive gains exclusive access to the East Coast warehouse formerly used by Artesian Builds, dives into finances, and uncovers behavior we believe to be potentially fraudulent.\n\nGet a GN Tear-Down Toolkit: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gamersnexus-tear-down-toolkit\nGet a GN Modmat for PC building! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat-volt-large\nOr a GN Blue & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-wireframe-mouse-mat\n\n(Error correction: It's a triceratops skull, not a tyrannosaurus skull)\n\r\nWatch our first part of this story here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9NzY8TDCAY\n\nLike our content?

But during his remarks, the president was interrupted by Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquin was one of 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.  \n\n» Subscribe to USA TODAY: http://bit.ly/1xa3XAh\n» Watch more on this and other topics from USA TODAY: https://bit.ly/3uHprM5\n» USA TODAY delivers current local and national news, sports, entertainment,  finance, technology, and more through award-winning journalism, photos, videos and VR.\n\n#Biden #Parkland #Shooting","title":"Biden interrupted by father of Parkland victim | USA TODAY","duration":60,"channel_id":"UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g","author":"USA TODAY","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8P75mHo7p0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/l8P75mHo7p0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":309274}}

{"description":"CHUNG HA 청하 ‘Sparkling’ MV\n\nStream/ Download 'Sparkling' : https://ffm.to/chungha_barerare_pt1\nSubscribe CHUNG HA : https://www.youtube.com/c/CHUNGHA_OFFICIAL?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCHUNG HA The 2nd Studio Album [ Bare&Rare Pt.1 ] ‘Sparkling’\n\n“You make me sparkle, I’ll be your sparkle” is like the relationship between Byulharang and me, shining on each other. As much as you’ve been waiting, let’s enjoy the ever more sparkling summer together. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! \n\n\"You make me sparkle, I'll be your sparkle\" 서로를 비춰주는 별하랑과 저의 관계 같아요~ 오래 기다려 주신 만큼 더욱더 반짝반짝한 여름 함께 보내요 진심으로 늘 고맙습니다! \n\nThis fetching piece features sound like a refreshing soda pop, with its identity of hyper-vibe on top of a fast BPM around 160. Like the first sip of an ice cold drink on a hot summer day, the song expresses the clear and cool feeling of a cold and tangy pop. The fast mood could easily seem as light but by capturing the fast mood with Chung Ha’s strong voice, this cool and sparkle track was completed. The arpeggio of the analog synthesizer achieves harmony with the retro but trendy drumline, and by adding in the electric guitar, the chorus also realizes a tough but witty rich sound. And Chung Ha’s chameleonic changes in emotions corresponding with the lyrics can be a key point of this song. Like the lyrics, “You make me sparkle”, “I’ll be your sparkle”, Chung Ha’s ‘Sparkling’ will glitter up our summer moments. \n\n160대의 빠른 BPM 위에 하이퍼 바이브를 아이덴티티로, 탄산처럼 시원한 사운드가 매력적인 곡이다. 무더운 여름날 시원한 음료를 마시는 첫 모금처럼, 차갑고 알싸하게 톡 쏘는 청량한 감성을 표현했다. 또 자칫 가볍게 느껴질 수 있는 빠른 무드를 청하의 단단한 보컬이 잡아주어 쿨하면서도 Sparkle 한 트랙을 완성했다. 아날로그 신디사이저의 아르페지오가 레트로하면서도 트렌디한 드럼라인과 조화를 이루며, 코러스 역시 일렉 기타를 가미해 터프하면서도 재치 있는 다채로운 사운드를 구현했다. 또 노랫말에 맞게 카멜레온처럼 바뀌는 청하의 감성과 감정 표현도 이 곡의 Key point가 될 수 있다.  \"네가 나를 반짝거리게 해\", \"내가 너의 빛이 될게\"라는 Sparkling의 가사처럼, 청하의 ‘Sparkling’은 우리들의 여름 그 순간순간을 반짝반짝 빛나게 장식한다.\n\n\n[ CHUNG HA 'Sparkling' Credits ]\n\nLyrics by BXN, CHUNG HA\nComposed by BXN, Prime Time\nArranged by BXN\n\nDrums Performed by Hangsuk Jwa\nEP Performed by Gilbeom Lee\nGuitar Performed by Moohyuk Byun\nBackground Vocals by Ashley Alisha, CHUNG HA\nVocal Directed by BXN, Fuxxy\n\nRecorded by Jung Eunkyeng @ Ingrid Studio\nDigital Editing by Jung Eunkyeng, Yang Yung Eun @ Ingrid Studio\nMixed by DRK (Assist.

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! a bit of an experimental video here, but i hope you guys like it... \n\nHave you ever wondered why you always get lost in IKEA? Or why you can't leave Sephora without a hand full of lipstick swatches? Or why you just love hanging out at Target? I was curious... so I decided to do some research on how different retail stores manipulate you into spending more time at their stores, interacting with their products more, and therefore, spending more of you hard earned cash at their shops. We explored different tactics that Ikea, Target, Sephora, and Ulta use to lure customers in & keep them there until they make a purchase! This is the first of a 3-part series we're gonna be working on throughout the year!\n\nA big thank you to Jen Clinehens for helping us out with this video; make sure to check out her YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/GrowLiketheGreatest\n\nMake sure to check out The Food Theorists' video on Grocery store manipulation here!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqviBPG2uPE\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nWRITTEN by\nRachel Faulkner\nSafiya Nygaard\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDayana Espinoza\nJarvis Rooker\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nOther sources:\nRemus, Emily. “Disruptive Shopping: Women, Space, and Capitalism.” The American Historian, The Organization of American Historians\nSegran, Elizabeth. “Department Stores Were the Original Retail Startups.

{"description":"The 2023 Acura Integra Elite A-Spec MT (~$46,280 in Canada as specced, $ in the US) is finally back after a long 15 year wait. To blend sportiness with comfortability, Acura have included a limited slip differential and adaptive dampers to compliment their 1.5L turbo four cylinder. However, for the price this trim commands, it’s put into some competitive territory among FWD cars. It also has to compete with its more affordable younger brother, the Civic SI - which comes very well specced here in Canada. Thomas and James spend some time with the new Integra to see how it stands out among the crowd, and if it is worth the jump up from the delightful Civic. We hope you enjoy the episode!

{"description":"New signing Gabriel Jesus scored 90 seconds into his non-competitive debut to trigger an extraordinary turnaround in Germany.\n\n1. FC Nurnberg, who play in the second tier of German football, raced to a 2-0 half-time lead, before we emerged as a different proposition after the break.\n\nJesus had to sit and watch from the bench for the opening half, alongside other new arrival Marquinhos, with Matt Turner the only one of our four summer signings named in the starting XI.\n\nBut once Jesus was unleashed, he marked the occasion with a wonderful brace, and had a say in both of the own goals too.\n\nThe other goal came from the boot of Mohamed Elneny, and what a screamer it was, flying in from long range.\n\nMikel Arteta opted for a fairly young starting lineup, including 17-year-old defender Reuell Walters, one of several youngsters out with the squad at our training camp in Germany.\n\nHe started in the centre of defence alongside Pablo Mari, and showed his speed early on to get back and dispossess Kwadwo Duah. Christoph Daferner had already headed wide when well placed in a bright opening for the home side.\n\nIt look 15 minutes for us to fashion our first effort on goal. Emile Smith Rowe’s right-footed curler was goalbound until Christian Mathenia in the hosts’ goal turned it away for a corner.\n\nMidway through the half though we fell behind, when Johannes Geis struck powerfully from outside the area, in off the crossbar. There was plenty of pace and movement on the shot, deceiving Turner in the Gunners goal.\n\nJust five minutes later Duah doubled the advantage, cracking home across Turner inside the far post after we lost possession cheaply.\n\nWe had to regroup. Ainsley Maitland-Niles flashed a cross-shot just wide while Reiss Nelson saw an effort deflected behind for a corner.\n\nBut we failed to really get going in the opening half, and went in two goals down at the break.\n\nJesus was brought on at the interval, along with three other subs. And with virtually his first touch in an Arsenal shirt, he fired us back into the game.\n\nHe picked up possession outside the area, advanced and swapped passes with Eddie Nketiah, before smashing home at the near post. What an introduction to life as a Gunner.\n\nThe tone of the game had changed and moments later he strode into the box again before being tackled this time.\n\nOne of the other half-time replacements, Mohamed Elneny, brought us level with an absolute thunderbolt from fully 25 yards.\n\nInside an hour we were ahead. After another excellent move, a deep cross was destined for Jesus’s head, only for Christopher Schindler to stretch out a boot and turn the ball past his own keeper.\n\nIt was a stunning 12-minute turnaround from Arteta’s men.\n\nWe weren’t finished there though. Just after the hour mark, Nketiah’s shot cannoned back off the cross bar, hit Nurnberg defender Tim Handwerker and trickled over his own goal-line under pressure from Jesus.\n\nMore subs followed for the last 20 minutes, with Folarin Balogun, Charlie Patino, Salah Oulad M’hand, Arthur Okonkwo and new arrival Marquinhos all coming on.\n\nNurnberg substitute Lukas Schleimer momentarily pulled it back to a single goal deficit, but Jesus soon claimed his second of the afternoon, from a Gabriel Martinelli cross, to make it 5-3.\n\nIt was a wonderful, instinctive finish from our new boy to beat the keeper from close range.\n\nBy now we were in control, and able to enjoy the denouement to a week of hard work and preparation at the adidas HQ in Germany. And if this is a glimpse of what’s to come from Jesus in particular, then the start of the season can’t come soon enough.\n\n#jesus #elneny #turner\n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Nikita Parris, Tobin Heath, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White, Thomas Partey and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"According to Brian Windhorst, LeBron James is more interested in the Lakers getting Kyrie Irving than the organization itself and that the King might use his looming contract extension to push LA to jump for the point guard. The Lakers are also reportedly trying to pull in the San Antonio Spurs for a three-team deal in order to make the numbers work. Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe react to the report and discuss what this shows about LeBron.\n\n#Undisputed #NBA #LeBronJames\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube Channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n▶Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE\n►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube Channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\nFollow UNDISPUTED on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@undisputedonfs1?lang=en\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\nFollow Jenny Taft on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/JennyTaftTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.
