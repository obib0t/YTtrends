In this video, we finish our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support this potentially history-altering theory.\n\nMY SOCIALS:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/miniminuteman/\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@miniminuteman\nE-Mail (Business inquiries only.

{"description":"Gordon Murray's astonishing £2.8m T.50 is a 963kg, 654bhp three-seater that aims to right the wrongs of the McLaren F1. Not that it was famed for many. But 969 days after we got our first proper look at it, Gordon has given the car his official stamp of approval to bring development to a close, meaning we could finally have a go in it. \n\nNow, we don’t normally do passenger rides at Top Gear, but when three-time Indy 500 winner Dario Franchitti gives you a ring to ask if you want a lift, you don’t say no. Especially when it involves some flat-out runs so we can hear that naturally aspirated V12 scream as he works the six-speed manual gearbox. And – best of all – as it's a three-seater, it meant both Top Gear Magazine’s Jack Rix and Ollie Marriage could both have a go. And then pincer Dario with questions at 180mph.\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks \nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

The battle, which was fought between British and French forces versus German forces, kicked off on July 1, 1916, and ended on November 18 that same year.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\nMusic video was produced by Video Ink Ltd. https://www.videoink.co.uk\n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.","title":"SABATON - 1916 (Official Music Video)","duration":454,"channel_id":"UCjQhd1APsd5NQhiVZV7GYzg","author":"Sabaton","date":"20230414","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgGhhnQB1gw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HgGhhnQB1gw/hqdefault.webp?v=6433c014","content":{"View count":427741}}

In the late 1950s, Air Force planners were confident that the advent of powerful new radars and long-range air-to-air missiles had rendered close-range aerial combat a thing of the past. So fighter jets like venerable the Mcdonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom were not engineered to be light or agile like their predecessors. Instead, they were designed to be heavily-loaded with missiles and carry powerful radars. Their pilots were no longer trained to dogfight, as they would engage the enemy at great distances, well beyond visual range. \n\nBut in the Vietnam War, military planners learned the hard way that the age of dogfighting was far from over. American pilots were being downed at alarming rates. The Friend or Foe (IFF) systems designed to identify enemy targets proved unreliable, forcing Air Force pilots to get in close to visually identify targets. At close-range, up against more agile Soviet-built MiGs, the F-4s were at a disadvantage. They were less agile than the MiGs, lacked a gun for close-range combat, and their pilots weren’t properly trained. To make matters worse, 1967, the Soviet Union looked set to unveil what appeared to be a new super-fighter built for extreme maneuverability. \n\nThe devastating experience from Vietnam and concerns being outclassed in the skies pushed the United States to develop a new air-superiority fighter that could face off with any current or future Soviet-built fighter. The result would be a twin-engine, high-performance, all-weather air superiority fighter known for its incredible acceleration and agility. Engineered from the ground up for tactical dominance in any air space, the F-15 holds the distinction of over a hundred aerial victories without a single defeat. \n\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\n\nIntro Song:  ‘Requiem for Humanity Alternate’- https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/CEZ_CET_9065\n\nSong 1: ‘The Final Warning’ - https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/MYMA_JUST_0234\n\nSong 2: ‘Weapon of Choice’ -  https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/JL2Rr4Yi1B/\n\nSong 3: ‘Infiltration And Investigation’ - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/141553842-infiltration-and-investigationdark-suspense-infiltration-sce\n\nSong 4: ‘Something Is Coming’ - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/102107772-b-lynne-something-coming-no-legato-strings-orchestra-epic-su\n\nSong 5: ‘80s Glam Rock’ - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-glam-rock/32401699\n\nSong 6: ‘Baliachi’ - https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/CEZ_CEZ_4256\n\nSong 7: ‘80'S Dark Synthwave’ - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/53759123-80s-dark-synthwave\n\nSong 8: ‘Viking Tension’ - https://audiojungle.net/item/viking-tension/40074535\n\nSong 9: ‘Synthwave Technology Industrial’ - https://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave-technology-industrial/35272023\n\nThanks for watching!","title":"The World's Greatest Fighter Jet: The F-15 Eagle","duration":861,"channel_id":"UC1ZBQ-F-yktYD4m5AzM6pww","author":"Mustard","date":"20230413","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmlWmDokzGg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RmlWmDokzGg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1119790}}

Watch the trailer for The Last Voyage of the Demeter now. \n\nThe Last Voyage of the Demeter\nIn Theaters August 11th\nhttp://demetermovie.com/\n\nFacebook: https://uni.pictures/TLVOTDFB\nInstagram: https://uni.pictures/TLVOTDIG\nTwitter: https://uni.pictures/TLVOTDTW\nTikTok: https://uni.pictures/UniTikTok\n\n---\nBased on a single chilling chapter from Bram Stoker’s classic novel Dracula, The Last Voyage of the Demeter tells the terrifying story of the merchant ship Demeter, which was chartered to carry private cargo—fifty unmarked wooden crates—from Carpathia to London. \n\nStrange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship. When the Demeter finally arrives off the shores of England, it is a charred, derelict wreck. There is no trace of the crew.  \n \nThe film stars Corey Hawkins (In the Heights, Straight Outta Compton) as Clemens, a doctor who joins the Demeter crew, Aisling Franciosi (Game of Thrones, The Nightingale) as an unwitting stowaway, Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans) as the ship’s captain and David Dastmalchian (Dune, the Ant-Man franchise) as the Demeter’s first mate. \n \nThe film also features Jon Jon Briones (Ratched, American Horror Story), Stefan Kapicic (Deadpool films, Better Call Saul), Nikolai Nikolaeff (Stranger Things, Bruised) and Javier Botet (It films, Mama).\n \nFrom DreamWorks Pictures and the producers of Zodiac and Black Swan, The Last Voyage of the Demeter is directed by Norwegian horror virtuoso André Øvredal (Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark, Trollhunter), from a script by Bragi F. Schut (Escape Room), Stefan Ruzowitzky (The Counterfeiters) and Zak Olkewicz (the upcoming Bullet Train), based on the chapter “The Captain’s Log” of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. \n \nThe film is produced by Brad Fischer and by Oscar®-nominated producer Mike Medavoy and Arnold Messer for Phoenix Pictures and is executive produced by Matthew Hirsch.","title":"The Last Voyage of the Demeter | Official Trailer","duration":155,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230413","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FgUUO9Ztd0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6FgUUO9Ztd0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4777577}}
{"description":"City moved within three points of leaders Arsenal with a comfortable 3-1 win over Leicester.\nThe Blues swept the struggling Foxes aside in a blistering opening 24 minutes that saw John Stones score and Erling Haaland take his tally for the season to 47 with two more goals.\nIt looked as though there might be an avalanche of goals thereafter, but the visitors dug in and with both teams making numerous substitutions, the pattern of the game became somewhat disjointed.\nLeicester's Kelechi Iheanacho pulled one back late on and also saw a shot strike the inside of the post, but it was too little, too late.\n\nSUBSCRIBE! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mancity\n\nhttp://www.mancity.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/mancity\nhttp://www.twitter.com/mancity\nhttp://www.instagram.com/mancity\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mancity\n\nAbout the Official Man City YouTube Channel:\n\nHere you will find all the latest videos from Manchester City, including, all Premier League goals, highlights, behind-the-scenes footage, training and much more.\n\nGet closer to the likes of Jack Grealish, Bunny Shaw, Kevin De Bruyne, Lauren Hemp, Erling Haaland, Riyad Mahrez, Ellie Roebuck Phil Foden, Esme Morgan and the rest of Pep Guardiola & Gareth Taylor's teams!","title":"HIGHLIGHTS Man City 3-1 Leicester | Haaland (2), Stones, Iheanacho Goals","duration":148,"channel_id":"UCkzCjdRMrW2vXLx8mvPVLdQ","author":"Man City","date":"20230415","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgEoPtFrGQg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wgEoPtFrGQg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2744624}}

{"description":"Today AD is welcomed by Troian Bellisario and Patrick J. Adams for a tour of their 1924 Spanish Colonial Revival home in Los Angeles. Designed by one of the lions of the golden age of California architecture, Wallace Neff, its white stucco exterior, colorfully tiled main staircase, and wrought-iron details are all calling cards of his numerous Spanish-influenced homes. The actors and homeowners—Adams is best known for his role on _Suits_ in which he played Meghan Markle’s character’s love interest, while Bellisario starred on the popular teen drama _Pretty Little Liars_ —fell in love with the residence while in the midst of planning their 2016 wedding and moved in right after their honeymoon, embarking on renovations a few years later with designer Rosa Beltran. “The goal was to make it feel how Neff and the team of artisans who had worked on the home in the beginning would have wanted it to feel, and also to make it really comfortable and useful for a modern-day family,” says Beltran.\r\n\r\nSee more from Troian and Patrick's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/tour-troian-bellisario-and-patrick-j-adamss-eclectic-spanish-colonial-revival-home\r\n\r\nShop Troian and Patrick’s home style!\r\n\r\n*Lighting* \r\n(Similar) Etsy Mid Century Wall Sconce: https://fave.co/3KEK8j0\r\nWest Elm Metalized Glass USB Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3zUiucM\r\n(Similar) Boost Area Floor Lamp: https://amzn.to/3GDAU56\r\nWest Elm Caldas Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3MEJ6Gi\r\nLumens Currey & Company Nottaway Chandelier: https://fave.co/41mo2Z5\r\nJWDA Table Lamp: https://fave.co/41j5xp3\r\n(Similar) Etsy Moroccan Handmade Lamp: https://fave.co/3zYR5Gk\r\n\r\n*Accessories*\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Clay Planter: https://fave.co/3MEEShU\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Kilim Lumbar Pillows: https://fave.co/3KwMLmO\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Aqua Glass Mannequin Head: https://fave.co/411ip2B\r\n(Similar) Etsy Framed Blue Papilio Ulysses Butterfly: https://fave.co/4051Fqf\r\n(Similar) Etsy Los Angeles Highway Print: https://fave.co/3Kv9bF6\r\nOur Place Always Pan: https://fave.co/3KRY4az\r\n(Similar) Etsy Large Vintage Cutting Board: https://fave.co/41FKT2b\r\nAarke Carbonator: https://amzn.to/3KEPN8K\r\n(Similar) Etsy Greek God Head Planter: https://fave.co/410ZZPR\r\nDS & Durga Bowmakers Perfume: https://fave.co/41sf78F\r\nAesop Hand Soap: https://fave.co/401RX80\r\nEveryday Oil: https://amzn.to/3MEUYbd\r\nChemex Pour Over Coffee Maker: https://amzn.to/3GCHOrk\r\n(Similar) Revival Rugs Aritomo Vintage Turkish Rug: https://fave.co/3KurF8B\r\n\r\n*Furniture*\r\n(Similar) Glitzhome Terrazzo Plant Stand: https://fave.co/3GCURci\r\n(Similar) Chairish Rustic Elm Console Table: https://fave.co/3GBW4Aw\r\n(Similar) CB2 Flynn Velvet Ottoman: https://fave.co/411NlA4\r\n(Similar) Amazon Wood Barstool: https://amzn.to/404mRwg\r\n(Similar) Anthropologie Wallace Cane and Oak Sideboard: https://fave.co/3KSfmo2\r\n(Similar) Wayfair Leather Conference Chair: https://fave.co/3KAFsKC\r\n(Similar) Sundays Coastline Ottoman: https://fave.co/414PUkT\r\nArticle Sven Sofa: https://fave.co/409m2Cl\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nArtwork By: \r\nEdward Burtynsky https://www.edwardburtynsky.com/ \r\nLorien Haynes https://www.lorienhaynes.com/artist-work \r\nAndric Ljubodrag https://www.ljubodrag-andric.com/ \r\nKeita Morimoto https://www.keitamorimoto.com/ \r\nPat Perry https://patperry.net/art/paintings\r\nLindsay Ross https://www.lindseyrossphoto.com/about\r\nMax Wagner https://www.maxwanger.com/\r\n\r\nDirector: Winter Dunn\r\nDirector of Photography: AJ Young\r\nEditor: Ron Douglas\r\nTalent: Patrick Adams, Troian Bellisario\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nLine Producer: Joe Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Josh Crowe\r\nProduction Manager: Peter Brunette\r\nEquipment Manager: Kevin Balash\r\nCamera Operator: Josh Anderson\r\nAudio: Gray Thomas-Sowers\r\nProduction Assistant: Fernando Barajas\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague \r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nTalent Booker: Luke Leifeste\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nJunior Editor: Paul Tael\r\nAssistant Editor: Justin Symonds\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

{"description":"Launching on April 26, The Duviri Paradox is an entirely new way to play #Warframe – no matter where you are in your journey. If you’re a new Tenno, you’ll be asked to choose where you want your story to begin: The Origin System or The Duviri Paradox. Both paths will converge in time, but it’s up to you to decide.\n\nAn astonishing new experience awaits you once you assume the role of The Drifter and explore the vast, color-shifting Planes of Duviri through a gritty new Cinematic Quest. But be careful, Tenno. Your attempts to wrest control of this new open world will not go unnoticed by the despotic Dominus Thrax, whose emotions transform the fabric of Duviri itself. Fly high atop your loyal Kaithe solo, or Squad up with fellow Tenno to take on spectacular new threats like the fearsome Orowyrm. Will you restore Duviri before the next Spiral?\n\nFor full details on The Duviri Paradox, visit the official website here: https://www.warframe.com/the-duviri-paradox\n\n►► WHAT IS WARFRAME? \n\nJoin 70M+ registered players in Warframe, a cooperative, free-to-play third-person looter shooter set in a constantly evolving sci-fi universe.

Kennedy is on a mission to rescue Dr. Antonio Taylor from kidnappers, when a mysterious woman thwarts his pursuit. Meanwhile, B.S.A.A. agent Chris Redfield is investigating a zombie outbreak in San Francisco, where the cause of the infection cannot be identified. The only thing the victims have in common is that they all visited Alcatraz Island recently. Following that clue, Chris and his team head to the island, where a new horror awaits them. Directed by Eiichiro Hasumi (Assassination Classroom) from a screenplay by Makoto Fukami (Psycho-Pass). Based on Resident Evil, the hit survival-horror game that sold over 130 million copies worldwide, Death Island is a new CG animated film and sequel to Resident Evil: Vendetta.

Defeating woves she then presented with the Darksaber due to her technically winning it in combat all the way back in episode 2.\n\nThat takes us into this entry which sees the return of Moff Gideon and also the introduction of The Shadow Council.\n\nGideon ends up getting his own Mandalorian armour in this entry and you might remember that back in our episode 5 breakdown that we talked about a big clue towards this.","title":"THE MANDALORIAN Season 3 Episode 7 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Easter Eggs & Review","duration":1955,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230412","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSX-fL-Cg4s","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cSX-fL-Cg4s/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":355140}}

{"description":"Teresa Xie | April 10, 2023\nWhen Fred again.. first proposed a Tiny Desk concert, it wasn't immediately clear how he was going to make it work — not because he lacked creativity, but because translating purely electronic music at the Desk is a daunting task for anyone. How would an artist, whose performances take the form of DJ sets in front of massive audiences, curate an intimate and unique experience? But what the British songwriter and producer came up with is a reminder of what a Tiny Desk is at its best: an opportunity for artists to challenge themselves in such a way that it almost feels like they're making new music, all while sticking to what feels true to them. For Fred again.. that meant re-learning the marimba, playing the vibraphone, singing at the piano and looping sounds and beats — all at the same time. He began his set with \"Kyle (i found you),\" recreating the song's melody on the marimba while clips of featured poet Kyle \"Guante\" Tran Myhre reciting the work \"Love In The Time of Undeath\" appeared on-screen. Sitting at the piano, he faded the remnants of \"Kyle (i found you)\" into \"Roze (forgive),\" which features Fred again.. triggering vocals sampled from the artist I am Roze, whose powerful facial expressions were magnified on a screen.In a surprising pivot, the primary vocals on the following track, \"Me (heavy),\" came from Fred again.. himself, with no manipulation, creating a vulnerable sense of intimacy in the space. A flurry of looped piano keys marked the transition to \"Delilah (pull me out of this),\" with guest vocals pulled from pop singer Delilah Montagu's 2021 track \"Lost Keys.\" By his set's end, concluding with \"Faisal (envelops me),\" Fred again.. was back at the piano finally resting after moving seamlessly through a jam-packed Tiny Desk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Kyle (i found you)\"\n\"Roze (forgive)\"\n\"Adam (interlude)\"\n\"Me (heavy)\"\n\"Berwyn (interlude)\"\n\"Delilah (pull me out of this)\"\n\"Faisal (envelops me)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nFred again..: vocals, piano, vibraphone, marimba, electronics\nSpecial thanks to: Guante, I Am Roze (they/them), Aminé, Delilah Montagu, Berwyn, Faisal, Lucy Hickling, Gareth Nunns, Jamie Tinsley, Tony Friend, Tobias Miorin \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Sofia Seidel \nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Sofia Seidel, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant \nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galván, Teresa Xie\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #fredagain","title":"Fred again..: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1604,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230410","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQmPv_dTI0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4iQmPv_dTI0/hqdefault.jpg?v=643085c1","content":{"View count":2151917}}
