{"description":"This is the second fully integrated full stack test flight of Starship and the mighty Super Heavy booster, the largest and most most powerful rocket to ever fly. It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. \n\nThe goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-2 in April 20th which didn't make it to stage separation while also hoping the improvements to the launch pad hold up better than the previous attempt. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter near Hawaii about 90 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, nearly completing an orbit of the Earth. This would allow the teams to test the reentry profile and heat shields for the first time from orbital velocities. \n\nWant more information?

After a mere eight minutes of FP1, the session was red-flagged and eventually the Vegas GP practice (FP1) cancelled due to a safety issue. This caused massive delays throughout the night and caused Vegas FP2 delays!\n\nCarlos Sainz was the victom of the Vegas manhole cover, hitting it at high speed and causing significant damage to his Ferrari. The impact was so severe that it cracked his chassis, requiring a replacement. As a result of the incident the FIA decided on a Carlos Sainz grid penalty.\n\nThese Vegas GP delays left F1 fans unhappy with the situation, many of whom had paid top dollar for tickets to the event. Prior to the Las Vegas FP2, a majority of F1 fans forced to leave the track early as well - missing out on alsmot all the track action.\n\n#f1 #f12023 #f1lasvegas #lasvegasgp #vegasgp \n\nTo find out more about how a Manhole ruins Vegas F1, watch the full video now!\n\nPurchase a hand-signed F1 driver print here: https://www.kymillman.com/signed-f1-driver-photos/?v=635f407d621de\n\nBecome a channel member and receive monthly free wallpapers, RAW image files after each race, Exclusive videos and discounts at my store.

{"description":"HELLO! TerminalMontage just released another Pokemon Battle Royale! And once again I helped by doing the research and writing. Now in THIS video, I'm going to explain some of the finer details, as well as why certain things happen, including why certain Pokemon fared so well and even won! \n\nWatch (or re-watch, or re-re-watch) the Original! ➤ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl-Okv32Cg0\n\nWoah we've got MERCH!  ➤   https://www.gnoggin.net/\n\nSocials:\nXitter  ➤   http://twitter.com/Lockstin\nThreads ➤  https://www.threads.net/@lockstin_gnoggin\nInstagram ➤ https://goo.gl/zmJDxr\n\nAdditional Credits:\nWriter/Host: Lockstin Austin Lockwood\nVideo Edtor: Fineapple Ryan Porter\nOriginal Video Animation:  @TerminalMontage and the team.\n\n#pokemon #pokemonexplained #somethingseries \n\nChapters:\n00:00 Oh yeah! New Battle Royale!\n00:47 Why No Sylveon or Raichu?\n01:21 Explaining Bits of the Battle!\n09:05 Why the Fire Types?\n14:14 Why Pikachu V Blaziken?\n\nGnoggin, hosted by its creator Lockstin, is a show delving into the mysteries of Pokemon! (and other games sometimes too). Explaining everything there is to explain! Why is each Pokemon given the type it has? What are their origins? What is the lore of the Pokemon world and the design inspirations? And what does it all have to do with alchemy? Let's Go find out!\n\nBonus deleted scenes for the bottom of the description!\n     One joke I wrote but Jeremy (rightfully) cut was Eevee finding a Waterstone, looking at it with vehement disgust, and then moving on... if you know you know.  \n         Serperior and Quaquaval originally had a much more intense... binding moment... it was reduced to under a second for your sake... I, I really don't know what was going on with me while writing this one...\n\nYou'll notice there's a semi-secret second Eevee at the end of the Eeveeloutions scene. Earlier drafts of this royale feature multiple copies of some of the starters, such as Partner Pikachu AND regular Pikachu from Yellow, or 2 different Rowlets for example, one for Sun and Moon, and one for Legends Arceus. The semi-secret second Eevee has a Katana, it's the Eevee from Conquest specifically, it was left as just a small visual gag/nod to that. Also at one point, I considered including the many starter Pokemon from Pokemon Battle Revolution too, but ultimately that would add too many Pokemon that most people would just be confused by... So we left it to the main game's Starter Pokemon.","title":"EXPLAINING The Starter Pokemon Battle Royale from @TerminalMontage! 💥","duration":1448,"channel_id":"UC6sjkvDzyY0J8o7k2Kc5rEw","author":"Lockstin & Gnoggin","date":"20231115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_VHfcpNcPA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1_VHfcpNcPA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":731687}}

{"description":"Explore a bustling new world and get up close and personal with neighbors in The Sims™ 4 For Rent Expansion Pack*, launching Dec 7 at 10 a.m. PT. Pre-order or buy through January 18 to get the Street Eats Digital Content**! (This content will become available when the pack launches.) Pre-order now: https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-for-rent-expansion-pack \n \nThere’s a new way for Sims to generate income – by investing in Residential Rentals. As a property owner your Sim can live among their tenants and be a hands-on property manager, or they can live away from their investment in a separate residence. But don’t let them get passive about this income stream! Property owners will have to keep their unit ratings high through regular maintenance or they could wind up dealing with a Tenant Revolt.\n \nResidential Rentals are more than just a way for savvy Sims to make Simoleons; they’re a way to bring communities together and tell new kinds of stories. Maybe your Sim is starting fresh in a basement suite, or maybe two young Sims become sweethearts after growing up in different units of the same duplex. You can now divide lots into multiple units, which creates new possibilities for what you can build. It also means different families will be living on the same lot and have plenty of chances to interact with each other.\n \nYour Sims can bond with their neighbors, chatting by the mailboxes in their apartment building or enjoying food together at a potluck. Or, they can seize the opportunity to dig up dirt on everyone around them. Eavesdropping, snooping, and breaking into their neighbors units are all on the table.\n \nAvailable Dec 7 at 10 a.m. PT on Origin PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation®4, and PlayStation®5. \n \nPre-order now: https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-for-rent-expansion-pack\n \n*Requires The Sims 4 & all game updates.

New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called “The Plastics,” ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina’s crosshairs. As Cady sets to take down the group’s apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli’i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.\n\nConnect with #MeanGirls online:\nOfficial Site: https://meangirls.com\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@meangirls\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/meangirls/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MeanGirls\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meangirls/\n\nSign up for EXCLUSIVE content & updates: https://www.meangirls.com/signup/\n\nParamount Pictures Corporation (PPC), a major global producer and distributor of filmed entertainment, is a unit of Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB, VIA), home to premier global media brands that create compelling television programs, motion pictures, short-form content, apps, games, consumer products, social media experiences, and other entertainment content for audiences in more than 180 countries.\n \nConnect with Paramount Pictures online:\nOfficial Site: http://www.paramount.com/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@paramountpics\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/ParamountPics\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/paramountpics\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Paramount\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Paramount\n\n#MeanGirls #TinaFey #ReneéRapp #AngourieRice #ChristopherBriney #Auli'iCravalho #JaquelSpivey #Avantika #BebeWood #JonHamm #BusyPhilipps #JennaFischer #AshleyPark","title":"Mean Girls | Regina's Version (2024 Movie)","duration":48,"channel_id":"UCF9imwPMSGz4Vq1NiTWCC7g","author":"Paramount Pictures","date":"20231115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tWGm5yhD84","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9tWGm5yhD84/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":396671}}

{"description":"Every now and then the F1 organisers throw a spanner in the works - and we typically get a very unusual Grand Prix. And that’s likely to be true for the first race on the new circuit in Las Vegas. \n\nIt’s fast, it’s a street track and the race starts at 10pm local time. But the biggest challenge for the teams is that at that time, it’s going to be cold… really cold. \n\nSo, why is the drastically colder than usual temperature such an issue? What are the teams and drivers going to do about it? And are we going to see an incredibly chaotic race?\n\nFormula One cars really don’t work well at cold temperatures. Now, this is counterintuitive. You might notice that all of the fastest laps at your local kart track were set in the evening or at night. But in F1, the power units and in particular, the tyres just aren’t made to work when temperatures are below about 15 degrees celsius. \n\nAnd you might ask, why? Well, the vast majority of the season is within a fairly tight temperature band, within the mid to high 20 degrees C range - and it has been for a while. \n\n📹 All source footage can be found here 👉 https://bit.ly/3QYhEoB \n\n➤Follow Driver61 on:\n   ➤ Instagram- @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n   ➤TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok\n\n➤ Follow Scott on:\n   ➤ Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell\n   ➤ Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n\n#Formula1 #LasVegasGP #F1","title":"Formula 1's Challenges in the COLDEST Race Yet | #LasVegasGP","duration":595,"channel_id":"UCtbLA0YM6EpwUQhFUyPQU9Q","author":"Driver61","date":"20231115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc6KAPqpRPY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/oc6KAPqpRPY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":605025}}

{"description":"Under extreme pressures, matter defies the rules of physics as we know it.\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nPhysicists have a pretty good handle on how stuff behaves on the surface of the Earth. But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. \n\nWhat happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF’s Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures​​) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens. A few standout findings so far:\n\nWater can become a hot black ice that conducts electricity: https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-hot-superionic-ice-may-be-natures-most-common-form-of-water-20190508/\n\nHydrogen gas can be compressed down into a shiny metal: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119442-metallic-hydrogen-finally-made-in-lab-at-mind-boggling-pressure/\n\nSodium (a soft, silvery metal at atmospheric pressure) can turn transparent: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312180838.htm\n\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://cmap.rochester.edu/\n\nWhat happens under extreme pressures deep with planets also influences their ability to foster life. Check out our videos about the search for Earth-like worlds beyond our solar system:\n\nWhat we found when we went looking for another Earth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrAFaONyLtU\n\nHow to find a planet you can’t see:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STsI6IbPbGQ \n\nHere’s  a closer look at another giant laser (at the National Ignition Facility):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMaKhXkihGQ \n\nTo see a classic film that takes a similar approach to understanding distances (from the microscopic to the galactic) check out “Powers of Ten”:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0 \n\nThis material is based upon work of the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP), supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY-2020249.

The brand new teaser is now here and throughout this video we're gonna be talking about the characters, plot and all the things connected to Spider-mans big web.\n\nNow the film is gonna be the first of three Sony Marvel movies to release next year with the others being Kraven and Venom 3. Beyond The Spider-verse was originally meant to release then too but theyre just taking their time with it to make it the best film possible. Its totally fair enough and I am curious to see how things go with this movie. It's gonna be heavily rooted in time travel and early leaks were saying that it's basically Terminator but with Peter Parker instead of John Connor.\n\nEither way we're gonna be going through it all and if you enjoy the video then please hit the thumbs up. Don't forget to subscribe for breakdowns like this every day and with that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into Madam Web.\n\n-\n\nNow the teaser begins with something we'll talk about in just a bit but it basically shows how events throughout the film will be repeated throughout. It has web entering a diner where shes united with the heroes of the film before theyre all attacked and killed by an evil version of spider-man. From here we jump to a week prior where we see her working as a paramedic. She almost dies when doing this and is sent over the edge of a bridge on a car. Nearly drowning we see certain clips in her visions and these include her standing infront of a spiders web in a tree. There's also a shot of someone holding a baby and then passing this on. Theres also her falling into the water and im guessing that these are visions of the future which will happen throughout the film.","title":"MADAME WEB Trailer Breakdown | Spider-Man Easter Eggs, Things You Missed & Reaction","duration":856,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20231115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu9i-5SSSkI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mu9i-5SSSkI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":260730}}
