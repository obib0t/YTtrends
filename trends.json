After over two years of lockdowns and quarantines, people eagerly restarted their lives, but there were certainly growing pains. Weddings and travel skyrocketed, but so did lost luggage and global inflation rates. Taylor Swift broke Ticketmaster. Cryptocurrency was headed toward a great year until it really, really wasn‚Äôt. 2022 tested the world population as we tested out life in a new phase of the pandemic.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine, and aid relief flooded into the war-torn country. Refugees were welcomed into surrounding countries, and those who stayed behind inspired people around the world. Global protests cried out for justice in Iran. Football teams stood up for migrant workers and the LGBTQ+ community at the World Cup. Cuba legalized same-sex marriage. The world froze for a moment when England‚Äôs longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, died. And we all watched a lot of TikTok. \n\nAs we head into 2023, take a moment to look back at the events that defined this year.\n\nFor more on 2022 from Vox.com:\n\nAlissa Wilkinson‚Äôs The 25 best movies of 2022: https://www.vox.com/culture/23484805/best-movies-2022-streaming-theaters\n\nConstance Grady‚Äôs Vox‚Äôs 16 best books of 2022: https://www.vox.com/culture/23500142/best-books-2022-if-i-survive-you-vladimir-furrows-lessons-either-or-ducks-joan-is-okay-shy-hotbed\n\nMarin Cogan‚Äôs Antisemitism isn‚Äôt new.

{"description":"The 2022 Ford GT (US $660,845 when purchased) is so much more than a pretty face designed in a wind tunnel. It has a twin turbo V6 with 660 horsepower, lots of weight saving carbon fibre, and a rapidly-deploying suspension drop system along with an active rear wing that is as functional as it is dramatic. But how does it stack up against a 2023 Corvette C8 Z06 ($164,505 as specced in the US, $189,027 in Canada) which is but a fraction of the cost and has a high-revving naturally aspirated V8? Thomas and James put these two marvels of American engineering to the test. We hope you enjoy the episode! Thanks for watching.

You can tell he worked on the video because the animation was good lol. I'm working on building a team to be able to make more videos and Matt has been a huge help in that effort. I'm still learning how to build a team at all so there may be some growing pains but it's exciting that it's happening.\n\nAnyway this video is about an experience I had last summer. My friend invited me to go farm sit and that was a great and rare opportunity just plopped on my lap so I decided I really wanted to go. And so I did! There was a lot of new experiences gained from the trip, and in this video was the most notable ones. Italy is a beautiful place with really tasty food. I am certainly going back some day.

But, with the help of my wife, Vy Qwaint, I think we can build a pretty awesome indoor family entertainment center for everybody to enjoy. Inside the adventure park we plan on having a trampoline park, video game arcade, zip line, ropes course, ninja warrior training courses, escape rooms, axe throwing, free roam Virtual Reality VR, retro barcade, climbing walls, restaurant, birthday party rooms, and a ton more fun stuff to do here in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nWe're gonna need a lot more help to get this FEC built by my birthday on March 10th so we need to hire some help. Vy interviews Burt and attempts to interview a guy name James but it doesn't go so well. The last candidate, Anne, we brought over to interview from bed.
