{"description":"Halloween Ends\n10.14.22\nhttps://www.halloweenmovie.com/\n\nThis is Laurie Strode’s last stand. \n\nAfter 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive. \n\nIcon Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the last time as Laurie Strode, horror’s first “final girl” and the role that launched Curtis’ career. Curtis has portrayed Laurie for more than four decades now, one of the longest actor-character pairings in cinema history. When the franchise relaunched in 2018, Halloween shattered box office records, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing chapter and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a horror film starring a woman. \n\nFour years after the events of last year’s Halloween Kills, Laurie is living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and is finishing writing her memoir. Michael Myers hasn’t been seen since. Laurie, after allowing the specter of Michael to determine and drive her reality for decades, has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell; The Hardy Boys, Virgin River), is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can’t control, once and for all. \n\nHalloween Ends co-stars returning cast Will Patton as Officer Frank Hawkins, Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and James Jude Courtney as The Shape.  \n\nFrom the creative team that relaunched the franchise with 2018’s Halloween and Halloween Kills, the film is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Paul Brad Logan (Manglehorn), Chris Bernier (The Driver series), Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Halloween Ends is produced by Malek Akkad, Jason Blum and Bill Block. The executive producers are John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Ryan Freimann, Ryan Turek, Andrew Golov, Thom Zadra and Christopher H. Warner. \n\nUniversal Pictures, Miramax and Blumhouse present a Malek Akkad production, in association with Rough House Pictures. \n\nFacebook:","title":"Halloween Ends - Official Trailer","duration":76,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20220720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mAWKyfj6c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/i_mAWKyfj6c/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1198401}}

If the sloshes get too far apart, we call it a drought.

{"description":"Better Call Saul Season 6 Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained. In-depth recap and review of “Fun and Games”. Please subscribe! 👉 http://bit.ly/PetePeppers\n\nIn the ninth episode of Better Call Saul's final season, we wrapped up the story of Jimmy McGill in the prequel's timeline. In the end, Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) made a decision to leave because even though she loves Jimmy (Bob Odenkirk), she contends that they are like poison when they are together. \n\nIn episode 9 after the breakup, the show jumps ahead in time to the Breaking Bad timeline. We see that Jimmy has completely transformed into Saul Goodman with Kim out of his life.  \n\nEpisode 609: “Fun and Games”\nDirected by Michael Morris\nWritten by Ann Cherkis\nOriginal Air Date July 18, 2022\nOfficial Synopsis: Gus attempts to smooth things over with the cartel while Mike ties up loose ends.\n\nHeralded as “a beautiful tragedy and gripping character drama” (IndieWire) and “one of the best dramas on television” (Vulture), Saul’s 13-episode final season will roll out in two parts with the first seven episodes beginning April 18 and culminating with the series’ final six episodes beginning July 11. \n\nBetter Call Saul’s final season concludes the complicated journey and transformation of its compromised hero, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), into criminal lawyer Saul Goodman. From the cartel to the courthouse, from Albuquerque to Omaha, season six tracks Jimmy, Saul and Gene as well as Jimmy’s complex relationship with Kim (Rhea Seehorn), who is in the midst of her own existential crisis. Meanwhile, Mike (Jonathan Banks), Gus (Giancarlo Esposito), Nacho (Michael Mando) and Lalo (Tony Dalton) are locked into a game of cat and mouse with mortal stakes.\n\nIf you want to leave me a tip for my work 💰 https://paypal.me/petepeppersYT\n\nWhat are your favorite BCS theories for the upcoming season 6?

{"description":"When adjusted for inflation, wages have remained virtually unchanged over the last 50 years, with workers today earning just 12 cents more than they did in 1972. And with inflation at its highest since 1971, Americans are feeling the pain of slow wage growth. Two-thirds of American workers said that inflation has outpaced any salary gains made in the past year. But some economists argue that the concept is merely a myth politicians use to promote their careers. So, how real is wage stagnation in America today and what does it mean for American workers?

The reality was a bloody lie. When Elizabeth Holmes claimed she'd invented a device that with a pinprick of blood could diagnose hundreds of medical conditions, she became the darling of Silicon Valley. Holmes, along with her business partner and ex-lover Sunny Balwani, then set about duping investors to bankroll their multi-billion dollar company, Theranos. But what the couple didn't count on was the courage of two of their own staff who knew the blood machine didn't work, and knew they had to tell the world. Now Holmes and Balwani have been found guilty of fraud and could face decades in jail.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #travel #travelvlog #tuscany #tuscanytrail \n\n00:00 Recap Tuscany Trail Day 1, 2, and 3\n00:57 Day 4 - the one that broke Kara\n04:18 Kara joins the support crew\n12:32 Day 5 - the one with the castle\n27:23 Group outdoor shower 😂\n31:15 Day 6 - the one with the broken bikes\n38:32 Day 7 - the one with the crash","title":"She didn't make it...","duration":2589,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220716","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWPM2y8qEJc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jWPM2y8qEJc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1088451}}

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 We Sold Our Catamaran!\n00:52 Prepping to Leave Forever\n02:45 Why We're Leaving Everything Behind\n05:02 Storm's A Comin\n05:56 Packing for the South Island of NZ\n07:16 The Mementos We Can't Leave\n09:15 Impromptu Tour of a Sunreef 62' Cat\n17:59 One Last Chambong Celebration\n19:42 The Interior Reveal of our HH44\n22:48 The last Hours on CURIOSITY 😢\n24:11 Help Us Plan Our NZ South Island Trip!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"The End of Boat Life","duration":1569,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNwt_HBqxpg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZNwt_HBqxpg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":348823}}

The game features an action combat playstyle that allows the player to swap between 4 individual characters in a party to quickly combo attacks. Single-player gameplay is the focus of the game, with Co-Op Mode available for certain activities.\n\nEach character has two unique combat skills: a normal skill and a special skill. The normal skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, while the special skill has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy first.\n\nCharacters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro, and Geo. Cooking is another significant aspect of Genshin Impact's gameplay. Players gather many resources in the course of their adventure, some of which can be turned into dishes via cooking. Some dishes regenerate characters' health, while others boost attack or defensive abilities.\n\n#genshinimpact #gaming","title":"I Smashed the Universe Into Pieces with 4 Heizous | Genshin Impact","duration":960,"channel_id":"UCZzxTLnsGMD-ZDH9o5MatGw","author":"itspaikon","date":"20220716","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0HQ5RhE0ek","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0HQ5RhE0ek/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":494701}}
