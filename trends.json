{"description":"Shifting wind patterns are making extreme weather events more likely. This is because the wind, which distributes areas of high and low pressure along the latitude lines of the Earth, is also being influenced by climate change.\n\nThe wind is the motor for our weather. It brings us both sunshine and rain. And during the winter months, it regularly blows itself up into heavy storms. But throughout the globe, climate change is causing shifts in existing wind systems - with devastating consequences. Atlantic hurricanes, which build up over the tropics and often lay waste to swathes of land on the eastern coast of the US, are becoming more intense and bringing heavier rainfall.\n\nScientists are looking for clues as to the precise causes for the warming in the Arctic, where temperatures are climbing more rapidly than anywhere else in the world. In the northern hemisphere, rising temperatures result in wind systems ‘twisting’ at 10-kilometer altitudes. The Arctic jet stream drives high- and low-pressure areas around the globe. It travels around the planet from west to east at speeds of up to 500 kilometers an hour. But in recent years, meteorologists have noticed more frequent weaker phases in the jet stream - with fatal consequences for Europe. Droughts like the one experienced in 2018 and flood catastrophes like that of 2021 are both likely to recur.\n\nResearchers on the island of Spitsbergen have already made an alarming discovery. Climate change is altering the wind, and the altered wind is accelerating climate change - a dangerous vicious cycle.\n\n#dwdocumentary #documentary #climatechange \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You'll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories- or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you're low on funds. Jobs and missions pay well, but you'll need to use that money to maintain your truck. When you think your truck is powerful enough, and you have enough bankroll for major repairs, use your truck to complete some of the map's challenges, such as races, rock crawls, hill climbs, and very destructive long jumps.\n\nIf you're not good with mechanics, don't worry. Your truck comes with a fully illustrated service manual. The town also has a mechanic who can give inspections, or even make repairs if you have the cash.\n\n- Fully integrated stock engine and drivetrain with over 60 stock parts, a swappable V8 engine with even more parts, and lots of aftermarket parts.\n- Upgradeable parts such as EFI conversion, headers, drive gears, turbochargers, several off road tire options, and accessories.\n- Fully responsive engine and drivetrain which exhibits true-to-life performance and auditory feedback on part failure, temperature, or fluid issues.\n- Miles of off road trails and roadways.\n- Open world game with freedom to play how you want to play.\n- Off road challenges; some which are difficult, others which are nearly impossible.\n- Make money with heavy delivery missions, rescue missions, collecting junk around the map and recycling it at the junkyard. Or work for yourself by brewing moonshine, logging, mining, or pressing your luck at the pub playing Texas Hold'em.\n- Day and night cycle, requiring you maintain your food, hydration, and sleep.\n- Softbody physics.","title":"How to Be the Worst Neighbor In Existence","duration":1058,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220930","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8KmRw8610","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/J_8KmRw8610/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1717050}}

{"description":"Goals from Thomas Partey, Gabriel Jesus and Granit Xhaka ensured derby day delight for us as we beat our arch-rivals to maintain top spot in the Premier League table.\n\nPartey’s wonderful strike from distance set us on our way, and despite a Harry Kane penalty ensuring the sides went in level at the break, a poacher’s effort from Jesus restored our lead four minutes into the second half.\n\nEmerson Royal was then red carded for the visitors and soon after Xhaka drove in a third to secure a third straight home victor in this fixture for the first time since 2013.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing ahead of kick-off as our Gooners created a cauldron of noise, and their efforts in the stands were matched on the field as we bossed the opening half an hour.\n\nThe game was just two minutes old when Gabriel Martinelli saw a volley smack off Hugo Lloris’ post, and then Granit Xhaka saw an imaginative flick towards goal spin narrowly wide after a wonderful cross from Bukayo Saka.\n\nAnd on 20 minutes, we grabbed the lead with an absolute blockbuster. Saka was again involved, receiving possession on the right and found Ben White. He laid the ball off to Partey who curled it towards goal first-time from 25 yards, and saw it flash past Lloris and into the top corner to send the already-high decibel levels stratospheric.\n\nBut for all our early dominance, Spurs found a way back level just 10 minutes later when we failed to clear our lines from a counter-attack and Gabriel fouled Richarlison in the area. Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot, allowing Kane to convert from 12 yards for the seventh time in north London derbies.\n\nHaving levelled things up, Spurs’ tails were up and led to a shaky period for us with Kane heading straight at Ramsdale after another swift break, but we still nearly went into the break back in front when a mazy dribble in the box by Gabriel Jesus saw him beat two defenders but shoot straight at Lloris from close-range.\n\nHowever, just four minutes after the restart, the Brazilian did get his goal to flip the game back in our favour. Saka did well to jink inside from the right and get a shot away, which Lloris did well to parry. Cristian Romero dallied with the rebound, and inadvertently sent the ball squirming under his goalkeeper, allowing Jesus to pounce and slam it home.\n\nOur no. 9 looked destined to grab a second soon after but misplaced his header from an Oleksandr Zinchenko and sent a golden chance wide, but on 62 minutes we received another huge boost to our chances of victory when Royal was dismissed for a foul tackle from behind on Martinelli.\n\nSensing an opportunity to seal the win, we quickly pressed for a third goal and after Saka bent a shot wide after coming inside, it arrived. Martinelli scampered down the left flank and got to the edge of the box, before laying it off to Xhaka who drilled a low shot under Lloris and grab his second of the campaign and send the stadium into delirium.\n\nThat killed the game off as a contest and we easily saw out the final minutes amongst a crescendo of noise as we matched last season's fine result, ended our opponents' unbeaten start, remained on top spot and sent all Gooners home happy.\n\n#arsenal \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Kim Little, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

So we were itching to whip up another batch of franken makeup, and we realized lip glosses had escaped our grasp up until this point – but not anymore! So yet again, we raided Sephora, buying one of each lip gloss they had in stock and then mixing them all together into one franken-batch to rule them all. What did you think of our final color? \n\nAlso also, if you’d like to learn more about the makeup recycling service that we used at Nordstrom, you can read about it on their site here: https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/get-involved/nordstrom-beauty-cycle \n\nOn top of all of that, if you’d like to buy yourself some of our Fiendish Behavior merchandise, you can check out our shop here: https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nPS - in case you want some more from us, we did just post ANOTHER franken video today over on Tyler’s channel. It features us testing out our own separate approaches towards frankening together one of every oreo flavor we could find. We’re calling it the Frank-Off! So be sure to check it out as well.

{"description":"Halloween Ends - The Final Trailer\nIn theaters and streaming only on Peacock October 14\n\nThis is Laurie Strode’s last stand. \n\nAfter 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive. \n\nIcon Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the last time as Laurie Strode, horror’s first “final girl” and the role that launched Curtis’ career. Curtis has portrayed Laurie for more than four decades now, one of the longest actor-character pairings in cinema history. When the franchise relaunched in 2018, Halloween shattered box office records, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing chapter and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a horror film starring a woman. \n\nFour years after the events of last year’s Halloween Kills, Laurie is living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and is finishing writing her memoir. Michael Myers hasn’t been seen since. Laurie, after allowing the specter of Michael to determine and drive her reality for decades, has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell; The Hardy Boys, Virgin River), is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can’t control, once and for all. \n\nHalloween Ends co-stars returning cast Will Patton as Officer Frank Hawkins, Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and James Jude Courtney as The Shape.  \n\nFrom the creative team that relaunched the franchise with 2018’s Halloween and Halloween Kills, the film is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Paul Brad Logan (Manglehorn), Chris Bernier (The Driver series), Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Halloween Ends is produced by Malek Akkad, Jason Blum and Bill Block. The executive producers are John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Ryan Freimann, Ryan Turek, Andrew Golov, Thom Zadra and Christopher H.

The material here uses the rules in the 2014 Player’s Handbook, except where noted. Providing feedback on this document is one way you can help shape the next generation of D&D! \n\nInside you’ll find the following content:\n\nExpert Classes. Three Classes appear in this document, each one a member of the Expert Group: the Bard, the Ranger, and the Rogue. Each Class appears with one Subclass. More Subclasses will appear in Unearthed Arcana in the months ahead.\n\nFeats. Feats follow the Class descriptions, particularly feats available to the classes in this\ndocument.\n\nSpell Lists. Three Spell lists—the Arcane, Divine, and Primal lists—are featured here. The Ranger uses the Primal list, and the Bard potentially uses all three, thanks to the Magical Secrets feature.\n\nRules Glossary. In this document, any term in the body text that is underlined appears in a glossary at the end.

After seeing \"Slave For You,\" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, \"Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.\"\n\nProd Co: UnderWonder Content\nProducers: Robert Katz, Frank Borin, Ivana Borin \nDirector: Tanu Muino\n\nWatch more Elton videos: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WatchMore\nSubscribe to Elton channel: http://bit.ly/EltonYTSubscribe \n\nFollow Elton John on...\nFacebook: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/facebookYT \nTwitter: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/twitterYT \nInstagram: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/instaYT \nOfficial Website: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WebsiteOfficial \nJoin the Rocket Club newsletter: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/RocketClub \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/EltonJohn","title":"Elton John, Britney Spears - Hold Me Closer (Official Video)","duration":205,"channel_id":"UCI8Ry7NdFNLel-S8dWU7mDA","author":"EltonJohnVEVO","date":"20220927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qExVlz3zb0k","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/hqdefault.jpg?v=6332f93b","content":{"View count":1481100}}

Now attention turns to her successor. The Queen’s eldest son, now King Charles III, has spent his entire life preparing for the mighty role he’s inherited. But as Tara Brown reports, many people are already questioning how comfortably the Crown will fit him.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.
