{"description":"The USMNT and Canada squared off in an ELECTRIC battle in the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup. During the first half, both teams' backline put in an amazing effort as not many chances went past both sides. Heading into the second half, much stayed the same until Brandon Vazquez's towering header gave the USMNT a 1-0 lead late in the game. It didn't take look for Canada to respond. Steven Vitória's clinical penalty finish forced the game to extra time. In the final stages of extra time, Jacob Shaffelburg gave Canada the brief lead, but a costly own goal forced the game to penalty kicks. Within penalty kicks, it was Matt Turner's HUGE saves which sealed the victory for the United States. USMNT will play Panama in the semifinals.  \n\n#FOXSoccer #CONCACAF #UnitedStatesVsCanada\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

{"description":"How I Hunted the rarest armor on this minecraft server\n\nLike Sharkilz and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft SMP. Like Parrot / ParrotX2 Lifesteal SMP Series or Lomedy and his Infuse SMP Series, where he broke bedrock or blew up 12.240 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. I escaped this Minecraft prison like Omziiscool but not Parrot or Clownpierce or Spoke with 100+ / 2,193 Bedrock and TNT.  This stacked player stole my permanent hearts on the Lifesteal SMP.

The sequel to the worldwide smash hit follows Sister Irene as she once again comes face-to-face with Valak, the demon nun.\n\nTaissa Farmiga (“The Nun,” “The Gilded Age”) returns as Sister Irene, joined by Jonas Bloquet (“Tirailleurs,” “The Nun”), Storm Reid (“The Last of Us,” “The Suicide Squad”), Anna Popplewell (“Fairytale,” “The Chronicles of Narnia” trilogy) and Bonnie Aarons (reprising her role from “The Nun”), surrounded by an ensemble cast of international talent.\n\nMichael Chaves (“The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It”) directs, from a screenplay by Ian Goldberg & Richard Naing (“Eli,” “The Autopsy of Jane Doe”) and Akela Cooper (“M3GAN,” “Malignant”),with a story by Cooper, based on characters created by James Wan & Gary Dauberman.\n\nThe Safran Company’s Peter Safran and Atomic Monster’s James Wan produce, continuing their collaboration as filmmakers on all of the previous “Conjuring” films. “The Nun II” is executive produced by Richard Brener, Dave Neustadter, Victoria Palmeri, Gary Dauberman, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Michael Polaire.\nJoining Chaves behind the camera are director of photography Tristan Nyby (“The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,” “The Dark and the Wicked”), production designer Stéphane Cressend (“Les Vedettes,” “The French Dispatch”), editor Gregory Plotkin (2022’s “Scream,” “Get Out”), visual effects producer Sophie A. Leclerc (“Finch,” “Lucy”) and costume designer Agnès Béziers (“Oxygen,” “The Breitner Commando”), with composer Marco Beltrami (2022’s “Scream,” ”Venom: Let There Be Carnage”) providing the score.\n\n“The Conjuring” Universe is the highest grossing horror franchise in history with $2+ billion worldwide.

Despite it being the dry season, it still rains unpredictably in this climate. This can undo lots of labor in dissolving bricks. I built a shelter from wood and palm thatch to house the entire brick making process from the rain. This was no easy task with primitive technology. Leveling the ground took a week with digging sticks and clay pots to move the soil down the slope to form a flat floor. Another week was spent cutting the timber with a stone axe and then lashing the frame with lawyer cane to form the 3 x 3 pyramidal hut with a total height of 3.5 m. A final week was spent cutting, splitting and thatching a total of 1850 palm fronds to cover the roof. \nI then made 50 bricks (enough for one firing) along one side of the huts floor and made a kiln from other bricks right in the center of the hut's floor under the highest point of the hut. A space for firewood was put in the corner. \nThough I didn't fire the kiln in this video due to time constraints, it should work well without burning the roof. I've previously had a kiln under cover and it worked well. This pyramidal roof design should funnel the smoke up preserving the thatch from mold and insects. The reason I went back to using thatch instead of tiles is  that I need bricks and tiles to make such a hut so this hut needs to be built before obtaining those materials.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #1 #2","title":"Primitive Technology: Undercover Brick Workshop","duration":1000,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230706","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz6aAI3shDY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xz6aAI3shDY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1097689}}

{"description":"Based on a true American Story. Killers of the Flower Moon, in theaters October.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder.

{"description":"An overview of seawater desalination: removing salt to make drinkable water from the ocean.\n💡 Go to https://brilliant.org/PracticalEngineering for a 30-day free trial & the first 200 people will get 20% off their annual subscription.\n\nCorrection: The Carlsbad plant produces 50 MGD, which is roughly 190,000 cubic meters per day (not 23,000 as stated).\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that there are more than 18,000 desalination plants operating across the globe. But, those plants provide less than a percent of global water needs even though they consume a quarter of all the energy used by the water industry. The oceans are a nearly unlimited resource of water with this seemingly trivial caveat, which is that the water is just a little bit salty. It’s totally understandable to wonder why that little bit of salt is such an enormous obstacle.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-why-is-desalination-so-difficult?ref=practical-engineering\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"The 2024 Aston Martin DB12 ($281,800 in Canada, $245,000 in the US) is finally here and is what Aston calls the world’s first Super Tourer. The V12 found in the DB11 has been left behind, and in its stead is an even more powerful twin-turbo V8 that makes 671 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Along with many new updates, such as stiffer torsional rigidity, all-new suspension, and an upgraded infotainment system, does the new DB12 deserve the title of Super Tourer? And how does it stack up against the competition? Thomas and James are excited to find out. We hope you enjoy the episode.
