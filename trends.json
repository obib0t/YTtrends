The benefit of using bricks to make a furnace is that it's quicker, easier, re-useable and portable relative to a furnace constructed in-situ from clay. This is because the old furnaces crack and need repairs where as the brick ones can be assembled and re-assembled with any broken bricks being swapped out as necessary. Also, the shape and height of the furnace is easily changed by adding/subtracting or re-arranging bricks.\n The first furnace used a square plan with the bricks laid on their sides with a inner cross section of 18 cm square. A 2.5 cm diameter tuyere was used and about 15 g of iron was made. The second furnace was the same but used a 5 cm diameter tuyere. It made about the same amount of iron. The 3rd furnace was a haexagonal plan furnace with a diameter of about 22 cm. The bricks were laid on their ends for this type. The smelt yielded the same as the square ones for the same input of ore, charcoal and effort.\nI'll probably stick to using the square design made from bricks in future. Things I may try later would be to increase the height of the furnace by adding more brick layers. I'd put in all the charcoal and ore for the smelt after preheating. Then I'd be able to operate the smelt without the interruption of needing to charge the furnace every 5 minutes with ore and charcoal.\nIn conclusion, bricks make a useful furnace in a shorter time and with less difficulty than in situ made furnaces, are re-useable and can be disassembled and rebuilt in various locations if needed while the bricks can be stored out of the way when not in use. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Today critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Rita Ora welcomes AD to London for a tour of her extraordinary Victorian-era home. Ora finished furnishing her new place with vintage finds from London‚Äôs famous Portobello Road Market - and most of the items she‚Äôd already owned and used in previous homes. Her sister and manager, Elena Ora, is responsible for arranging the furniture and interior designer Joanna Plant was brought in to add ‚Äúlittle bits and bobs‚Äù to tie everything together. As she works on her third album, Ora couldn‚Äôt be happier with the calm and grounding home base she‚Äôs created. ‚ÄúMy exterior self is super flamboyant, colorful, and I‚Äôm really proud of the decisions I make. Internally, my interior self is the opposite. I wanted my inner self reflected in my home.‚Äù\r\n\r\nRita Ora is an international critically acclaimed singer-songwriter with over 10 billion world-wide streams, four #1 UK singles, and holds the record for the most Top 10 singles for a British female artist in the UK in history with a total of 13. In addition to being one of most successful female artists in the UK, she also lends her voice to the series Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight on Netflix, and will star in the upcoming film Tin Soldier. As a multi-talented industry leader, Rita also launched the award-winning Pr√≥spero Tequila with Conecuh Brands and premier Master Distiller Stella Anguiano, where she serves as Chief Creative Partner.\r\n\r\nSee more of Rita's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/rita-ora-house-victorian-era-sanctuary-in-london\r\n\r\nShop Rita's home style!\r\n\r\n*Kitchen*\r\n(Similar) Set of Three Bread Boards: https://fave.co/3rtknsv\r\n(Similar) Ruffled Marble Bowl:¬†https://fave.co/3M8sOTu\r\nDelonghi Distinta Electric Kettle:¬†https://amzn.to/3EhmTK1\r\n\r\n*Bathroom*\r\nAesop Hand Soap:¬†https://fave.co/3SA4Bbt\r\nDiptyque Candle:¬†https://fave.co/3Cx8WX2\r\n(Similar) Hex Brushed Brass Towel Bar:¬†https://fave.co/3SROWV7\r\n(Similar) Huxton 2-Piece Iron Planter Set:¬†https://fave.co/3fwtGVQ\r\n\r\n*Bedroom*\r\n(Similar) Belle Nightstand: https://fave.co/3M5qr3Q\r\nCalypso Chandelier:¬†https://fave.co/3V0ItbA\r\n(Similar) Marilyn Monroe Vintage Print:¬†https://fave.co/3fJY8fd\r\n(Similar) Hand Tufted Tiger Face Rug:¬†https://fave.co/3CzOO6V\r\n(Similar) Feng Shui Red Resin Buddha Figurines:¬†https://amzn.to/3rrmHAt\r\n\r\n*Living Room*\r\n(Similar) Mid Century Modern Solid Teak and Brass Coffee Table: https://fave.co/3e0xJcU\r\nVersace Medusa Lumiere Ashtray:¬†https://fave.co/3UWXyLz\r\n(Similar) Margot 90\" Velvet Sofa:¬†https://fave.co/3RGuZ1L\r\n(Similar) Moritz Round Mirror, Brass 36\":¬†https://fave.co/3Ehkv6f\r\n(Similar) Still Carafe:¬†https://fave.co/3SCntGJ\r\nHermes Wool Cashmere Blanket:¬†https://fave.co/3RuY2Wc\r\n(Similar) 4 Piece Gold Fireplace Tool Set:¬†https://fave.co/3SDLVYi\r\n\r\n*Makeup Room*\r\nLego Brick Heads Spice Girls:¬†https://fave.co/3M5utcu\r\n\r\n*Dining Room*\r\nAnissa Kermiche Love Handles Light Gray Vase: https://fave.co/3EhbuK9\r\n(Similar) Recycled Glass Mason Jar Vase: https://fave.co/3Eh7nhq\r\n(Similar) Aurora Candlestick Holders:¬†https://fave.co/3fEVfwk\r\nDamien Hirst for Supreme Spots Skate Deck:¬†https://fave.co/3SU03fM\r\n(Similar) Ceramic Line Footed Planters White (set of 2):¬†https://fave.co/3e7laMQ\r\n(Similar) Aimee Dining Arm Chair:¬†https://fave.co/3Ei2Ew2\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

Take a look for yourself. Lynn‚Äôs last words were a Bible verse, John 3:20-21. ‚ÄúEveryone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.

{"description":"The Super Mario Bros. animated movie from Nintendo and Illumination just got its first look in a new poster! Mario stares at the beautiful Mushroom Kingdom, with references to the Super Mario Bros. franchise in every direction. This Mario Movie teaser is an unbelievable first impression.\n\nWhen The Mario Movie was first announced from Nintendo and Illumination, people assumed it would be bad; Illumination doesn't have the best track record. Combine that with the Chris Pratt casting as Mario, along with other strange celebrity choices, and the ingredients were there for this to be another questionable video game movie. However, the new poster reveals that we may have been wrong. Could The Super Mario Bros. animated movie actually be... dare I say it... REALLY GOOD?!\n\nSOURCE: https://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1577297788513173506\n\nWelcome to Vailskibum!\nCartoon News ‚úß Reviews ‚úß Discussions\n\nSubscribe to keep up with my videos ‚Üí http://bit.ly/18ZdpzY\nNew to the channel?

{"description":"Legendary Overwatch content creator Seagull broke an almost 2 year hiatus from YouTube to make a video explaining his disappointment in Overwatch 2. Of course, Seagull's video is excellently produced, but I can't help but disagree with his pessimism when much of the boosts for the \"Early Access Overwatch 2 PvP Update\" are in response to his original criticisms in the State of Overwatch 1 video. Of course, it's hard to have faith in a new business model we have yet to see and who knows what state the PvED truly is in, but with tempered expectations for now I'm happy to be back on track at least for the live service PvP game.
