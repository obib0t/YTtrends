{"description":"Mike, Jay, and Rich Evans have returned again to the black void. Their reason today? To talk about a new huge summer blockbuster movie? No. Quite the opposite. They was gonna talk about Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 2: Dead Reckoning 1, BUT they thought‚Ä¶ how many times can one see Tom Cruise do stints? No, this day Mike, Jay, and Rich have returned to the black void to talk about ‚ÄúWatchbait‚Äù the movie version of ‚ÄúClickbait‚Äù. Trash that has overrun a once great institution like Tubi. And before you ask, no we wasn‚Äôt compensated by Tubi to promote these films. We were just browsing about and saw a trend. A trend of using certain words or phrases in a title to get one to click on their junk film to watch it, only to realize after a few minutes they made the worst mistake of their lives. This particular video wasn‚Äôt a Half in the Bag. Nor was it a re:View. Nor was it a Best of the Worst. I guess it could have been a ‚ÄúTalks About‚Äù video, but nah. We made a new show called ‚ÄúBeyond the Black Void‚Äù and if you ever see one of these again, it‚Äôs just Mike, Jay and Rich Evens talking about something of interest. In solidarity with the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strike we decided to talk about movies that in no way whatsoever could have possibly been made under any conceivable union agreement. In fact, I‚Äôd be shocked if one of these pictures weren‚Äôt some kind of nudie snuff film. Maybe that‚Äôs why Jay ‚Äúdownloaded all of them on his dark web server‚Äù whatever that means. And yes, it‚Äôs 100% true, we did just spring this whole thing on Rich Evans. I rang him up on my landline to tell him to come to the studio. Well, actually I left a message on his answering machine. He showed up coming from the gym where‚Äôs he‚Äôs done many power squats and asked me ‚ÄúWhat we shootin‚Äô Mike?‚Äù and I tell him to sit down and shut up you shit-for-brains. He sits down, but there is an immediate squish sound. It would appear that Rich had soiled his large diaper. He claimed he didn‚Äôt know. He insisted he ONLY wears a diaper when he does power squats at the gym. 1. it helps stifle the sound of any accidental fart release, but also for‚Ä¶ you know what. An accidental Hershey squirt. This is apparently what happened. Luckily a very large toddler had died outside our building and I was able to provide Rich Evans with replacement clothing. A lot went into this video. So please, enjoy.","title":"Beyond The Black Void - Watchbait","duration":1896,"channel_id":"UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA","author":"RedLetterMedia","date":"20230718","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeMadjM0ZZI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UeMadjM0ZZI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":440645}}

How did the US go from having luxurious, widely used passenger trains to the Amtrak system we have today? \n\nVideo producer Dean Peterson makes a 72-hour journey on Amtrak from LA to NYC to show its current state of operation. From getting kicked in the head by his sleeping seat mate to taking in sweeping views of the desert at sunset, Dean shows the highs and lows of being stuck on Amtrak for days on end. \n\nAlong the way, he explains the history of passenger rail in the US ‚Äî starting in the problematic robber baron era to the US government‚Äôs takeover of passenger rail. Will the United States ever catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to train travel, or are Americans stuck with an underfunded, inefficient rail network forever?

In this video, we'll explore and uncover why so few Americans live in what I've termed the \"Empty West.\"\n\nStock footage is acquired from www.storyblocks.com.\n\nSome videos provided by E James Merl on Pexels.\n\nAnimation support provided by DH Designs (needahittman.com)","title":"Why So Few Americans Live In This HUGE Area Of The West Coast","duration":700,"channel_id":"UC7-Z34pbJ0ZAOJRmUCEz0Cg","author":"Geography By Geoff","date":"20230717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOoFsehit6U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cOoFsehit6U/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":293934}}

Often described as \"a show about nothing,\" Seinfeld mines the humor in life's mundane situations like waiting in line, searching for a lost item, or the trials and tribulations of dating. Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry's ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry's neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry's eccentric neighbor, Kramer.\n\n#Seinfeld #LarryDavid #TheBeard\n\nGeorge's Toup√©e Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeld\nhttps://bit.ly/OfficialSeinfeld","title":"George's Toup√©e Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeld","duration":310,"channel_id":"UCKv01ZGOJhp2HbtDe4EvS8A","author":"Seinfeld","date":"20230717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVBbqvLtWBs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVBbqvLtWBs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":282613}}

The arcades include highly detailed machines with realistic physics that are inspired by modern arcade machines. There are ticket redemption areas to exchange your counted tickets for all kinds of fun prizes. Larry's Arcade has an in-house animatronic band called Teddy and the Ticket Eaters that would love to play you some tunes while you enjoy the arcade. The most recent addition to Islandville island, UFO Arcade features modern space inspired arcade machines, Lazer Tag and an Indoor Go Kart Race Track. Make sure to watch out for the minions, they really love Teddy and his band and they also are pretty good at Lazer Tag. Run out of money? That's ok. You can work odd jobs around the island to get back on your feet. Got extra prizes? The island has a Pawn Shop that will buy your used prizes for cash so you can go blow it back at the arcade.\n\nThe Coin Game also features a full fledged Traveling Carnival with over 20 classic games, rides and machines to choose from. The carnival also brings new prizes to win, hoard or sell for cash at Barrys pawn shop. The rides are all interactive and are overpriced just like in real life... so you better be winning, working or begging Uncle Phil for more spending cash if you want to enjoy them. (Birthday mode is unlimited money for all you lazies out there that just want to live off of Uncle Phils wallet and have a good time. So dont worry he has you covered). But dont get comfy as Survivor Mode is still being developed. ;)\n\nYou can play The Coin Game anyway that you like. For the laid back players, you can just play the fun games and win tickets to exchange for silly prizes. You don't have to worry about anything but winning tickets. Unlimited money. No curfews. No rules.... just arcade freedom brought to you by your rich Uncle Phil.\n\nThe Coin Game includes all the fun activities of a real trip to the arcade. Including drinking soda all day, dodging sugar filled minions and living off of vending machine cheesy poofs. To earn a little extra money you can scavenge the dumpsters and trash cans or even deliver newspapers around the island for extra spending loot. Explore the island on the Islandville bus system or even your very own golf cart.\n\nThere is lots of highway traffic and tourist activity on the island all year round, so make sure to keep off the roads or you may get a little surprise. There is even a few areas planned for the future that are off limits for now and surrounded by construction fencing to keep you safe. The Islandville Transit bus is always running if you need to get around the island doing chores. To hail the bus, simply click the button in any bus stop and buy a bus pass. Each bus ride costs one pass ($1.50).\n\nWith over 40 different games and machines there is already plenty to do on the island. You can play The Coin Game with any mouse, keyboard or any Dual stick/pad controller. The game includes a easy to use key mapping system to support virtually any controller or peripheral. So you can play The Coin Game any way that you like.\n\nThe Coin Game is developed by a one man indie developer over the last 3 years with the wonderful support of his wife, family and 2 weiner dogs.","title":"I Turned This Entire Game Into a Glitchy Pain Paradise - The Coin Game","duration":1320,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20230715","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NxW3xSAqUg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6NxW3xSAqUg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1618996}}

{"description":"Rory McIlroy produced a brilliant birdie-birdie finish to break home hearts and seal his second consecutive Rolex Series title at the Genesis Scottish Open.\n\n‚ñ∫ SUBSCRIBE: http://et.golf/Subscribe \r\n\r\nThe DP World Tour and PGA TOUR host the world's best for a second year at The Renaissance Club for the Genesis Scottish Open. The Field is full of golf's elite with Jon Rahm the only one in the top-10 choosing to miss this week before the year‚Äôs final major.

Rory McIlroy returns for his eighth appearance at Scotland's national open. Since finishing in a tie for seventh at the US PGA Championship in May, he‚Äôs made the top-10 in his subsequent four starts, including finishing runner-up at last month's U.S. Open. Xander Schauffele returns to defend his Genesis Scottish Open title. He‚Äôll feel optimistic of his chances this week after hitting a bogey-free 62 to equal the lowest round at a Major at last months US Open. He‚Äôs also claimed top-20 finishes in each of his last nine starts. Viktor Hovland, Max Homa, Jordan Spieth and Tommy Fleetwood will all be shooting for top spot in Scotland.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Official YouTube channel of the DP World Tour.

{"description":"Post Malone - Overdrive (Official Live Performance)\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast ‚Äì and it‚Äôs always been that way. Listen to ‚ÄúWhite Iverson‚Äù again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‚Äòbeerbongs & bentleys‚Äô and ‚ÄòTwelve Carat Toothache‚Äô and you‚Äôll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we‚Äôre waiting for ‚ÄòAustin,‚Äô Posty‚Äôs latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsome of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least ‚Äì trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.‚Äù To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he‚Äôs leveling up once again, no doubt. Check this performance of ‚ÄúOverdrive,‚Äù one of the 17 songs from the new album, and stay close as we roll out more performances soon.\n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.

The exclusive five-minute Opening Look, edited by the film‚Äôs editor Jennifer Lame, reveals new scenes, images and sounds from the IMAX¬Æ-shot epic thriller and features the film‚Äôs breathtaking score by Academy Award¬Æ winner Ludwig GoÃàransson. Oppenheimer, from Universal Pictures, arrives in theaters July 21, 2023.\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX¬Æ-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. \n \nThe film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù Oppenheimer. Oscar¬Æ winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar¬Æ winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar¬Æ nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment‚Äôs Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\nOppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX¬Æ 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX¬Æ black and white analogue photography. \n\nNolan‚Äôs films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations. \n\nSocial Handles:\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/oppenheimermovie    \nTW: https://www.twitter.com/@oppenheimerfilm  \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OppenheimerMovie \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/OppenheimerMovie/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/oppenheimermovie\nWebsite: https://www.OppenheimerMovie.com   \n#Oppenheimer","title":"Oppenheimer | Opening Look","duration":306,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230713","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOsIKu2VAkM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sOsIKu2VAkM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2687787}}

Now, the song, \"What Was I Made For?\" is ready to be released.\n\nBillie Eilish and Zane Lowe sit down in the theater to discuss the making of her song, \"What Was I Made For?\", which was created specifically for the blockbuster of the summer, but is also somehow incredibly personal. Billie opens up about her experience being involved in the movie, her feelings about songwriting for film and TV, and the childhood connection to Barbie that makes this a \"full circle\" moment.\n\nListen to Billie Eilish on Apple Music: https://apple.co/-BillieEilishYT\n\n00:00 - Billie Eilish on Her Involvement with Barbie\n9:34 - Inspiration Behind ‚ÄúWhat Was I Made For?‚Äù\n20:28 - Writer's Block\n27:35 - Billie Eilish on The Future\n\nSubscribe to Apple Music: https://apple.co/AppleMusicYT\n\nFollow Apple Music:\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@applemusic\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/applemusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/applemusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/applemusic\n\nWatch more Apple Music: \nWhat‚Äôs New: https://apple.co/2VFatTU\nApple Music Up Next: https://apple.co/2MLktXE\nInterviews: https://apple.co/32WnrPV\nWhat‚Äôs Trending: https://apple.co/2Meq89t\n\nApple Music lets you listen to millions of songs, online or off, totally ad-free.

{"description":"Only in theaters December 15. #WonkaMovie\n\nBased on the extraordinary character at the center of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl‚Äôs most iconic children‚Äôs book and one of the best-selling children‚Äôs books of all time, ‚ÄúWonka‚Äù tells the wondrous story of how the world‚Äôs greatest inventor, magician and chocolate-maker became the beloved Willy Wonka we know today.\n\nFrom Paul King, writer/director of the ‚ÄúPaddington‚Äù films, David Heyman, producer of ‚ÄúHarry Potter,‚Äù ‚ÄúGravity,‚Äù ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPaddington,‚Äù and producers Alexandra Derbyshire (the ‚ÄúPaddington‚Äù films, ‚ÄúJurassic World: Dominion‚Äù) and Luke Kelly (‚ÄúRoald Dahl‚Äôs The Witches‚Äù), comes an intoxicating mix of magic and music, mayhem and emotion, all told with fabulous heart and humor. Starring Timoth√©e Chalamet in the title role, this irresistibly vivid and inventive big screen spectacle will introduce audiences to a young Willy Wonka, chock-full of ideas and determined to change the world one delectable bite at a time‚Äîproving that the best things in life begin with a dream, and if you‚Äôre lucky enough to meet Willy Wonka, anything is possible.\n\nStarring alongside Chalamet are Calah Lane (‚ÄúThe Day Shall Come‚Äù), Emmy and Peabody Award winner Keegan-Michael Key (‚ÄúThe Prom,‚Äù ‚ÄúSchmigadoon‚Äù), Paterson Joseph (‚ÄúVigil,‚Äù ‚ÄúNoughts + Crosses‚Äù), Matt Lucas (‚ÄúPaddington,‚Äù ‚ÄúLittle Britain‚Äù), Mathew Baynton (‚ÄúThe Wrong Mans,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhosts‚Äù), Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins (‚ÄúThe Shape of Water,‚Äù the ‚ÄúPaddington‚Äù films, ‚ÄúSpencer‚Äù), Rowan Atkinson (the ‚ÄúJohnny English‚Äù and ‚ÄúMr. Bean‚Äù films, ‚ÄúLove Actually‚Äù), Jim Carter (‚ÄúDownton Abbey‚Äù), with Oscar winner Olivia Colman (‚ÄúThe Favourite‚Äù).

Michael Siegel, Cate Adams, Rosie Alison and Tim Wellspring are serving as executive producers. King‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Chung-Hoon Chung (‚ÄúLast Night in Soho,‚Äù ‚ÄúAh-ga-ssi‚Äù); Oscar-nominated production designer Nathan Crowley (‚ÄúTenet,‚Äù ‚ÄúDunkirk‚Äù); editor Mark Everson (the ‚ÄúPaddington‚Äù films); Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (the ‚ÄúPaddington‚Äù films, ‚ÄúTopsy-Turvy‚Äù); and composer Joby Talbot (the ‚ÄúSing‚Äù films).
