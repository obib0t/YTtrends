{"description":"David “El Monstruo” Benavídez lived up to his nickname and billings as perhaps the sport’s most destructive offensive weapon as he defended his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title and blitzed former two-division champion Demetrius “Boo Boo” Andrade with a stoppage after the sixth round in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night headlining a Premier Boxing Champions event from Michelob ULTRA Arena at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.\n \nThe ending came after Andrade’s trainer wouldn’t allow their charge to leave the corner to start the seventh round after Benavidez, fighting his first southpaw in seven years, bloodied and pounded Andrade in perhaps the signature performance of his career. Benavídez (28-0, 24 KOs) remained undefeated as Andrade (32-1, 19 KOs) suffered his first loss.\n \n“I think I just solidified myself as a dominant force here,” Benavídez said. “I just reminded everyone who the real champion at 168 is. Who wants to see me versus Canelo? I'm going to be super middleweight champion of the world, three-time world champion. Now just give me the fight that we all want to see. Who wants to see Benavídez versus Canelo?”\n \nBenavídez punctuated his performance with an embrace of Mike Tyson outside the ring following the stoppage. Tyson famously dubbed Benavídez the “Mexican Monster.”\n \n\"I just told Mike Tyson that I love him and thank you so much for the motivation he's given me,” Benavídez said. “It's not every day a boxing legend like Mike Tyson gives people nicknames, so I just want to live up to my name.\n \n“Everybody says I'm not this, I'm not that, I'm flat-footed, I have no defense. This guy probably applied one of the best defenses. He's really good offensively. He could barely even hit me, so I think that says a lot on its own. I just have to keep beating who they put in front of me. I'm the best. I'm going to be the best. I'm going to be a legend by the time I'm done, so whoever you keep putting in front of me, I'll keep knocking them down.\n \n\"Let's give the people what they want to see. They want to see Benavídez versus Canelo.\"\n \nJust as he did against Caleb Plant in March, Benavídez grew stronger and more dangerous as the fight wore on. After Andrade held his own in the opening rounds, Benavídez broke down his 35-year-old opponent with breathtaking efficiently. A looping right hand from Benavídez to the side of the head dropped Andrade for the third time in his career with seconds left in the fourth round. Andrade crumpled to the canvas and rose on shaky legs to survive the round.\n \nBenavídez hurt Andrade again with a left to start the fifth round as he continued to walk Andrade down and land hard punches. Andrade’s right eye started to close midway through the frame as Benavídez teed off on his 35-year-old opponent with a right uppercut and an assortment of short, stinging punches. Andrade took a stand with a minute left in the sixth, uncorking a right uppercut but Benavidez hurt Andrade, a former 2008 U.S. Olympian, with left that had him stumbling across the ring.\n \nIt was a far cry from the start of the fight when Andrade was able to smother Benavídez’s punches, darting in and out and winging shots from odd angles that found their mark. Andrade looked sensational in the first two rounds, while Benavídez bided his time, carefully picking his shots. Andrade started to slow down in the third, allowing Benavídez to unload his brand of destructive, compact punches before the knockdown turned the tide in Benavídez’s favor.  \n \n“I’ll be back – back to the drawing board,” Andrade said. “I moved up in weight classes. I’ll work on my body a little more and I’ll be right back at it. I thought overall I did everything I needed to do to get the bigger man off me. David's definitely a hell of a fighter. Nobody was even willing to get in the ring with him. I tried to become a three-division world champion. That's not far-fetched. David was the man tonight. Benavídez is the bigger man.”\n\n#BenavidezAndrade #DavidBenavidez #DemetriusAndrade \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Benavidez vs Andrade HIGHLIGHTS: November 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":187,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20231126","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtH8RT352o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hdtH8RT352o/hqdefault.jpg?v=6562ebd6","content":{"View count":1266990}}

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! So, I found something... a few months ago, while we were trying to film a video where I let TikTok ads pick my outfits, I stumbled upon... this dress. It goes by a few names but it's most commonly some version of the \"floral midriff shaper corset sundress\" - and after buying one for the video, my for you page started getting flooded with TONS of ads for what looked like the same dress - but all from different companies, and with wildly different price points. So, I decided - let's buy a few of these bad boys and see what actually ends up at our doorstep - and find out, what the heck IS up. Where are all these dresses coming from? Are they all the same dress? Clearly someone is lying here - but who?

You already know that anything simmered for hours is bound to be delicious. But this... this is the stew you've always dreamed of. It's the one I make when I have guests over and want to truly impress them!\nThe key ingredient that gives Guinness Stew its rich flavor and deep color is Guinness Beer. And don't worry, the dish doesn't taste like beer at all! It transforms into a savory sauce that is absolutely mouthwatering. Plus, all the alcohol cooks out, so you won't be left with any boozy taste. Adding bacon to the stew is optional, but it definitely adds extra flavor. So go ahead and indulge if you'd like. Either way, you're in for a truly special stew. Try this delicious dish and comment how do you like it! Have a delicious day! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n2 tbsp Olive oil\n2lb / 900g beef \nSeason with salt and black pepper\n2 garlic cloves\n2 onions \n6 oz / 170g bacon\n2 carrots\n2 celery stalks\n3 tbsp flour \n14.9 oz  / 440ml Guinness Beer \n3 tbsp tomato paste\n3 cups / 750 ml broth \n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp thyme \n\n🤩 Knives I used in this video -  https://amzn.to/3QILFYm\nhttps://amzn.to/46fFUqy\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Start by cutting the beef into big chunks, approximatelly 4-5cm.\n2. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot (cast iron dutch oven) over high heat. Add the beef in batches and brown it well on all sides. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the beef. Once browned, transfer the beef onto a plate and repeat with the remaining batch of beef.\n3. Lower the heat to medium. Cook the garlic and onion for about 2 minutes until they start to soften. Then, add the bacon and continue cooking until the bacon is browned.\n4. Stir in the carrot and celery, and cook for a few more minutes.\n5. Add the flour to the pot and stir for 1 minute to cook off the flour.\n6. Pour in the Guinness, broth and tomato paste. Mix well to ensure the flour dissolves completely. Add the bay leaves and thyme.\n7. Return the beef and any accumulated juices back into the pot. The liquid level should just cover the ingredients.\n8. Cover the pot and lower the heat to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for 2 hours until the beef is tender. Then, remove the lid and simmer for an additional 45 minutes, or until the beef easily falls apart and the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.\nServe the beef and Guinness stew with pasta, mashed potatoes or whatever you like.

{"description":"The 2024 Lexus LC500 Convertible ($129,186 starting in Canada, $106,550 starting in the US) is a comfortable GT cruiser, with a 5.0L V8 engine that bellows out a sonorous note and 471 horsepower as it climbs to its 7100 rpm redline. Best enjoyed with the top down, the LC500 Convertible makes a strong case for why it should be the GT car of choice. And given its price in comparison to some of its competition, the LC looks to provide some serious bang for your buck in the comfy GT category.

Enter promo code UNDECIDED to get up to 6 additional months for free at https://surfshark.deals/undecided It might surprise you to learn that the basic chemistry of the lithium ion battery at the heart of a brand new Tesla or iPhone hasn’t changed all that much in the last 30 years. So, when several of you left comments pointing me in the direction of a new company that’s replacing a key part of the battery with silicon and some nanowires, my curiosity was piqued. To add to that, one of my science advisory team members brought them up, too, which only added fuel to the curiosity fire.
