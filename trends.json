{"description":"The new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are ready for action. Built with aerospace-grade titanium for our lightest, most powerful Pro models ever.\n\nThe new Pro camera system pushes the limits of what‚Äôs possible on a smartphone, giving photographers the equivalent of seven pro lenses ranging from 13 mm on the Ultra Wide camera to 120 mm on the 5x Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nFilmmakers can now record video in ProRes 4K at 60 fps directly to an external drive. The addition of a USB-C connector brings superfast USB 3 transfer speeds, along with support for pro formats that massively improve the workflow between shooting and post-production.\n\nThe new design also includes a customizable Action button for quicker access to your favorite feature.*\n\nAnd the A17 Pro chip with a 6-core GPU introduces a whole new level of immersive mobile gaming performance. \n\nIn short, the new titanium iPhone 15 Pro is our most powerful photo-taking, movie-making, game-playing iPhone ever.\n\nLearn more about iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max: https://apple.co/3PBuiJq\n\nAudio Descriptions: https://apple.co/44QCI3W\n\n#AppleEvent #iPhone15Pro #iPhone\n\n*Translate action is coming in an update later this year\n\nWelcome to the official Apple YouTube channel.

{"description":"‚ú®üëâüèº Go to https://casetify.com/alexg today to get 15% off on your cases!\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - A BUYING GUIDE\nI really think that there are a few options to save money this year with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Plus and the regular iPhone 15. \n\nIn this video, I'm sharing with you all the options for all budgets and depending on what you prioritise.\n\nRenders by ld_vova (on Twitter / X)\n\nThe new iPhone 15 Pro Max is the latest and greatest phone on the market, but don't let the hype fool you. There are plenty of other phones (including the Apple iPhone 14 and 13 models) out there that are just as good depending on your needs. The iPhone 15 Pro Max could be overpriced at launch and might not have any features that stand out for your needs. Instead, spend your hard-earned cash on something more worth your money!\n\nShould you upgrade to the latest Apple iPhone 15 this year? Or should you look at alternatives? Is the iPhone 13 or 14 Pro Max for example still a good alternative? Could you afford to wait for the iPhone 15? \n\nApple's iPhone 15 promises a few upgrades, a bigger battery, better camera specs and a new A17 chip. Are these upgrades significant? Join me in this video as we discuss where it may not make sense to upgrade to the iPhone 15. And also where it absolutely does make sense to upgrade. \n\nEven if you decided that you are upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, in some cases, an upgrade is inevitable right? \n\nBut even in those cases, it can be confusing on which model of the iPhone 15 should you go for. And is the iPhone 15 Pro range the best choice for you? Or could the iPhone 14 Pro Max or iPhone 14 Pro be a better option, especially given the likely drop in prices after the release date?\n\n#iphone15promax #AppleEvent #iPhone15 #Apple  #iPhone15Plus #iPhone15Pro \n\n‚ö°Ô∏è I have my own shop on Amazon now!

Buckle up & get your fingernails ready, cause this one is a wild ride! a few years ago, I had the crazy idea to make a custom food truck of some sort - I just needed the perfect opportunity to do it. So when Cristine and I decided to create a Holo Taco collection together, I thought why not now - let's make a (holo) taco truck!! \n\nSo we took a super old FedEx truck and renovated it into a batty, vampy, ~holographic~ nail polish truck! Once it was finished, we loaded an army of nail polish into the truck and drove it around to several different meet ups around Raleigh. At each location, we gave away some free nail polish, saw lots of great nail art (a decent amount of which is featured in this video), & gave out some other fiendish goodies for you guys to enjoy (think chocolate & boba)!! \n\nThank you to everyone who could make the event!! What do you guys think of our nail polish truck? What should we turn the truck into next??\n\nAnd now, we‚Äôve finally reached the release date of the safiya x Holo Taco collection!! I hope you guys love it as much as we do! You can shop the limited edition collection now here: https://holota.co/safiyaxholotaco \n\nHuge thank you to the people over at Jack of All Trades by George for the crazy transformation of our nail polish truck - you can find them here!! https://www.jackofalltradesbygeorge.com/\n\nAnd thank you to our partners for the event day - Lola‚Äôs Nail Closet, Escaz√∫, & MILKLAB!!

{"description":"Hello, the video practically explains everything.\nGofund me link: https://gofund.me/fd72e8e4\n\nTo summarize, my dad was in a terrible bicycle accident that left him a person with quadriplegia. There was a window to help my dad; if we didn't, he would remain paralyzed for the rest of his life. Because we live in America, every step to get him this vital physical therapy has put my parents in a financially terrifying position. From having to purchase a $50,000 wheelchair-accessible vehicle due to the insurance that they paid $1400 a month for (for many, many years) failing them, and the lack of any form of public transportation or services to help him get to the physical therapy they are now paying out of pocket for, and due to this accident leaving both my parents out of a job...

{"description":"Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances ‚Äì either side if the interval ‚Äì and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

Picking up immediately after last weeks entry, that saw Ahsoka and co discovering the Eye of Sion after tracing the super star destroyer tracking device. This of course also explains how Hera shows up this week going against the Senators orders. Whether that means some of them are still inline with the Empire remains to be seen but as we know there are imperials in every aspect of the new republic.\n\nAnyway Ahsoka and co ended up landing in the Forest which is when droids were sent out after them and that takes us into the brand new entry. Directed by Pete Ramsey he co-directed Into The Spider-verse and Season 3 Episode 5 Of The Mandalorian.\n\n-\n\nNow we begin with the T6s crew trying to fix the ship so that they can reach out to home one with whats going on.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"AHSOKA Episode 4 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Easter Eggs, Review & Anakin Skywalker!","duration":1611,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230906","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vyRx2t8UDc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vyRx2t8UDc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":301073}}
