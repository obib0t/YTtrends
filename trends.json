A decade after their unforgettable eight-season run, comedy's most fabulous foursome is back. Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally reprise their celebrated roles as Will, Grace, Jack and Karen. The 11th and final season of Will & Grace will feature 18 episodes. Behold once again, from the minds of Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, TV's wittiest ensemble ever. The legendary James Burrows, director of every original Will & Grace episode, has returned with a slew of razor-sharp jabs and dirty martinis. Will & Grace stands as NBC's most watched comedy in seven years. Originally debuting in 1998, Will & Grace has been nominated for 91 Emmy Awards, winning 18 of them, including Outstanding Comedy Series.

{"description":"Speculation has been swirling since former Chinese President Hu Jintao was escorted out from the closing session of China’s twice a decade Communist Party’s Congress on Saturday (Oct 22), which saw Mr Hu's successor, Xi Jinping secure an unprecedented third term at the helm. \n\nCNA’s cameras captured the moments just prior to Mr Hu's departure, which took place soon after local and foreign media were allowed to enter the auditorium to cover proceedings around 11.15am. It came shortly after Chinese state media announced that delegates had elected a new Central Committee and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which media were not allowed into the hall to witness. \n\nCurrent chairman of China's legislature Li Zhanshu is seen taking papers out of Mr Hu's hand, before a man comes to speak to him and escorts him out. READ: https://cna.asia/3TwGKK7\n\nFollowing Mr Hu’s departure, proceedings continued with delegates voting on other items on the agenda including an amendment to the party’s constitution. Addressing the incident later that night, Chinese state media attributed the incident to health reasons. In a tweet written in English, Xinhua said that Mr Hu was “not feeling well” during the session and for his health, staff had accompanied to a room next to the meeting venue “for a rest”. Mr Hu's name was censored from Chinese social media.\n\nREAD MORE: https://cna.asia/3z7jDNS\n\nSubscribe to our channel here: https://cna.asia/youtubesub \n\nSubscribe to our news service on Telegram: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\nFollow us:\nCNA: https://cna.asia\nCNA Lifestyle: http://www.cnalifestyle.com \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@channelnewsasia","title":"Exclusive: What happened before former Chinese President Hu Jintao was escorted out of Congress?","duration":176,"channel_id":"UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg","author":"CNA","date":"20221024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBG2bD-TE9g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZBG2bD-TE9g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1821268}}

{"description":"Thanks for supporting our channel! Check out our MERCH Store Here → https://http://shopzeroedition.com/collections/screen-crush-merch\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has just dropped its first trailer! It includes our first look at Casie Lang in her superhero outfit, Bill Murray in the MCU, and Kang the conqueror. So we’re here to explain all of this, where they are, and what this means as we break down all easter eggs references and little things you might have missed in the first trailer for Ant Man and the Wasp Quantummania.\n\nGo here → http://screencrush.com/\nTikTok → https://www.tiktok.com/@screencrushnews\nLike us → https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush\nFollow us → https://twitter.com/screencrushnews\nGet our newsletter → http://screencrush.com/newsletter/\n\nWritten by Ryan Arey, Srinidhi Rao, with invaluable help form Harriet Lengel-Enright and Randolf Nombrado\nHosted by Ryan Arey (http://twitter.com/ryanarey)\nEdited by Harriet Lengel-Enright, Randolf Nombrado, Brianna McLarty, Ethan Lavinsky, srinidhi Rao, and Ryan Arey\n\n#AntMan #Quantumania #eastereggs \nNow before we get into all their weird quantum stuff let’s go to ordinary san francisco where scott lang is having a dream life. Unlike most heroes getting powers isn;t hurting scott’s personal life it’s improved iit. He’s well known around his neighborhood and as we learn in ms marvel he has a very popular superhero podcast called Big Me Little Me: A Scott Lang Interview.\n\nThis podcast is how Kamala Khan learned all the behind the scenes details of the final battle in endgame0–and Scott is the person bringing these stories to the masses. So in a  lot of ways Scott is the most accessible avenger. He’s the everyman.\n\nAnd we see him being honored at his old baskin robbins. This is of course a callback to the first any-man film where this was his first job out [rison–and they fired him when they found out he had a record. [clip]. Now he's been given an award for employee of the century–and this guy is the boss who fired him in the first place.\n\nNotice that the nametag on the photo says jack, because he worked there under a pseudonym. [Baskin Robbins always finds out]. Ironic that now they're celebrating him, and he wasn’t even allowed to work there under his own name. \n\nNotice also that his suit is slightly different now with this circle on the chest. I can’t help but think that the quantum suits in the endgame might have had some effect on the design. Those suits were designed by Tony Stark but did not feature the circle in the middle . However the quantum suits would have given scott and hank pym cces to some stark tech–specifically the way stark’s power systems always seem to be routed through an object on his chest. So the redesign could be based in stark tech or just a  tribute to the fallen hero tony stark.\n\nHe high fived a kid with an ant-man backpack. A big step up from when they didn;t know his name in the endgame. [clip selfie with me?]\n\nNow of course he’s not only an avenger he’s a guy who saved the universe. He and hope get invited to red carpets–like this one, for the global service humanitarian awards sponsored by the anthropology society. –where Scott is probably getting a trophy for, you know, saving reality [what if we could go back to before thanos].\n\nNow of course, he may be famous now, but scott is still just scott, and not everyone knows who he is [thanks spider-,an]. This is a callback to this joke [there’s an atman and a spider-man]. It may also show how public opinion about spider-man has shifted. Remember that psyterio did frame him for muder [clip]. And then right after revealed his secret identity, which was undone in no way home. But, here’s the thing. I wonder if the strange memory spell that made people forget about Peter Parker also undid people thinking he killed mysterio? Or at the very least, it’s nice to see there’ some people out there who just support spicy and don;t believe Quentin Beck [nwh, mysterio was right].\n\nNotice the coffee shop has lots of San Francisco themed drinks. It's called the drive cafe, named after the golden gate bridge. And the drinks are named after San Fran locations or events. The Embarcadero, Summer of Love, The Haight, Presidio, Pier 39, Golden Gate, and The Candlestick, after Candlestick park.\n \nThe abstract art in the coffee shop also looks a lot like the design of the Quantum Realm, foreshadowing what is to come. \n\nBack to the Pym household, which we say has been moved back from its original location, after Hank placed it on the beach in ant-man and the wasp. And then we meet a recast Cassie Lang, now played by Kathryn Newton from Detective Pikachu and Big Little Lies.  Don’t think Marvel’s ever said why they recast older cassie form endgame–might be because she tweeted a picture of herself announcing she had been cast. Or maybe they just wanted a different actor because cassie is going to become the superhero satture, like she is in the comics.","title":"ANT-MAN: QUANTUMANIA Trailer BREAKDOWN: Every Kang Easter Egg and Loki Connection","duration":1176,"channel_id":"UCgMJGv4cQl8-q71AyFeFmtg","author":"ScreenCrush","date":"20221024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ6sKzBARVo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hJ6sKzBARVo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":456014}}

{"description":"New Jersey is the only state in the U.S. that doesn’t allow customers to pump their own gas — anywhere. There’s always an attendant on duty to pump gas for customers at these full-service stations.\n\nOregon is the only other state besides New Jersey with a full-service law. However, Oregon’s laws are far less strict and allow certain parts of the state to have self-service gas stations.\n\n“It goes back to the middle of the 20th century,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth Polling Institute. “There were forces involved who wanted to protect their interests in terms of the smaller gas owners against mega gas stations that were starting to be built at the time that would require self-service to be profitable.”\n\nHistorically, gas stations with attendants were popular in the first half of the 1900s. But by the 1970s, most states had switched over to customers pumping their own gas. As these changes swept the U.S., a state ban on self-service in 1949, known as the Retail Gasoline Dispensing Safety Act, stopped the Garden State from following suit. Oregon passed its own similar law in 1951.\nIn the original bill, the New Jersey state legislature cited safety concerns and rising costs to consumers as reasons to not transition over to self-service. But every time there’s a spike in gas prices, bills opposing full service start to pop up. Seen as a ‘political third rail’ by many politicians including Gov. Phil Murphy, it’s one of the few legislative debates that doesn’t follow party lines. Every bill has failed so far, but it hasn’t stopped self-serve advocacy groups and politicians from pushing for change.\n\nWatch the video above to find out more about New Jersey’s full-service gas stations, why self-service options don’t find a home in the Garden State, and what’s next for its gas station owners.\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
