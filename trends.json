But how is he with spicy food? Find out as Sudeikis takes on the wings of death and discusses comedy heroes, Kansas City BBQ, and the connection between magic and improv.\n\nBUY HOT ONES HOT SAUCE NOW: https://fwfea.st/hotsauces\n\nTRY THE HOT ONES BONELESS CHICKEN BITE CHALLENGE: https://fwfea.st/chickenbites\n\nBUY HOT ONES TRUTH OR DAB: THE GAME: http://truthordabgame.com\n\nSHOP HOT ONES MERCH: https://bit.ly/2AIS271\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE HOT ONES MONTHLY HOT SAUCE SUBSCRIPTION: https://bit.ly/2veY50P\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE FIRST WE FEAST NEWSLETTER: http://firstwefeast.com/signup\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO FIRST WE FEAST ON YOUTUBE: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE BY DONATING TO COMMON THREADS, THE OFFICIAL  CHARITY PARTNER OF HOT ONES: https://www.commonthreads.org/firstwe...\n\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\n\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\nhttp://instagram.com/hotones/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast","title":"Jason Sudeikis Embraces Da Bomb While Eating Spicy Wings | Hot Ones","duration":1471,"channel_id":"UCPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA","author":"First We Feast","date":"20230525","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIdR332rqs8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sIdR332rqs8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1235103}}

Hollywood paints it as a time of gunslingers, adventure, and cowboy heroes, but as often is the case, the reality is a bit more lackluster. While it was a rather violent place with high murder rates, this can be misleading as even one murder in a small population size can produce seemingly astronomical murder rates, essentially enhancing outliers in data. The truth is, the \"Wild West\" was a rather calm and boring time where people were much more focused on getting to the next day than robbing trains or saving damsels in distress. But while the dangers painted by Hollywood and dime novels are often over exaggerated and glamorized, that doesn't mean the region and time period was void of danger! So join me back in time to learn about the real history and dangers of the American Wild West!\n\nTitle: Brett Van Donsel – Rattlesnake Railroad\nArtist: Brett Van Donsel\nSource: http://soundcloud.com/brett-van-donse...\nLicense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWild West by ZitronSound http://bit.ly/2nXGy9W\nCreative Commons — CC BY-ND 3.0 https://goo.gl/QHshNa","title":"How to Survive the Wild West","duration":1410,"channel_id":"UCvQ4C0f9_OWRf1uyobwqOwA","author":"BlueJay","date":"20230526","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLWZBXBOBs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxLWZBXBOBs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":210024}}

As Tommy leaves New York after losing Ghost, LaKeisha and the only city he's ever known, he makes a quick detour to close an old wound that’s been haunting him for decades. What was supposed to be a quick stop turns into a labyrinth of family secrets and lies Tommy thought were long buried.  One step leads to another and Tommy quickly finds himself in Chicago's drug game, inserting himself between the city's two biggest crews. In a city divided by race, Tommy straddles the line, ultimately becoming the lynchpin that not only unites them - but holds the POWER to watch them crumble. As the first season unfolds at breakneck speed, Tommy uses his outsider status to his advantage, breaking all the local rules and rewriting them on his quest to become the biggest drug dealer in Chicago.","title":"Power Book IV: Force | Official Teaser | Season 2","duration":35,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230522","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knFMIPwzP0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_knFMIPwzP0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":488653}}
