{"description":"Croatia and Spain faced off in Rotterdam, Netherlands, for the UEFA Nations League Final. Possession was near-equal in the first half with Spain knocking off six shots total and Croatia with seven. Three of Croatia’s seven shots were on goal, however none were successful. Halftime arrived nil-nil. Croatia took control early in the second half with an extremely close opportunity at 51’. Spain would strike back-to-back at 84’ and 85’ in attempt to take the lead in regular time. Tension grew as both 15 minute halves of extra time passed, still nil-nil. After a nail-biter round of penalty kicks, Dani Carvajal scored the 5-4 finisher and Spain was crowned victorious in the UEFA Nations League Final.\n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #Spain\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

In Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse we find out he unintentionally created his own villain AND that none of the events from the previous movie were meant to happen. Moreover, Peter Park was not supposed to die! Now with the world unraveling around him and Miguel and the Spider Society doing their best to restore the “canon events” we have to ask… could the multiverse actually collapse? Is this Spider-Man movie connected to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)?

Check out her Instagram page to see more of her awesome work: https://www.instagram.com/caitlinkalafus\n\nShane Burcaw (he/him) is the author of several award-winning books about disability. He is the President of a nonprofit organization called Laughing At My Nightmare, and a renowned public speaker who has performed across the country at places such as Harvard University, The University of Florida, The University of Connecticut, Princeton University, and many more.\n\nHannah Burcaw (she/her) graduated from Carleton College, where she studied Sociology and Anthropology. She films and edits the “Squirmy and Grubs” vlog, which has over 1,000,000 subscribers on YouTube. Hannah has spoken at prestigious universities and Fortune 500 companies alike about the realities of ableism. On her popular Instagram account, she advocates for acceptance of all people and works to improve the way society thinks about disability.\n\nShane and Hannah have been together for over four years. They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as “normal” as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together.","title":"Egg Retrieval Time! - IVF Journey Part 3","duration":889,"channel_id":"UCdomP1JqhnyBQGaBmfDl4KQ","author":"Squirmy and Grubs","date":"20230619","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvzJp5dMsq0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JvzJp5dMsq0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":148211}}

{"description":"Thanks to everyone for helping to set up this race:\n\n- Koenigsegg:  @wam_barn \n- Koenigsegg: WAM Barn's video of the day: https://youtu.be/bL9ASBb0OQw\n- Koenigsegg: https://www.instagram.com/wam.barn/\n- Tesla: https://aawireless.io/carwow\n    - Use coupon code \"CARWOW10OFF” for 10% discount on AAWireless.\n- Suzuki Hayabusa: https://www.tts-performance.co.uk/bikes\n- Suzuki Hayabusa:  @TTSPerformance \n- Suzuki Hayabusa: https://www.instagram.com/ttsperformance/\n- Suzuki Hayabusa:  @BikeWorldTVshow \n- https://www.instagram.com/petrolheadonism.club\n\nIt’s finally happened… We’ve got our hands on a Koenigsegg for a carwow drag race!! \n\nWe’ve got Mat lining up in the Koenigsegg Agera RST, and he’s about to go head-to-head against a Tesla Model S PLAID and a supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa! \n\nSo let’s see how these three monsters compare, and of course, we’ve got to start with the Koenigsegg! It’s powered by an incredible 5-litre twin-turbo V8 that delivers an eye-watering 1,360kg and 1,573Nm of torque. It’s equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and sends all of its power to the rear wheels. It’s also super light, tipping the scales at 1,395kg, and it’s easily the most expensive car Mat has ever drag-raced, with an estimated value of £3,500,000!! \n\nAlongside it, we have the Tesla Model S Plaid. It’s equipped with three motors, and they combine to put down 1,020hp and 1,420Nm, with all of this power being sent to all four wheels. Naturally, being electric, it’s weighed down a bit by the batteries and motors, and as a result, it weighs in at 2,190kg. \n\nThen finally we have the Hayabusa. But this is no usual Suzuki Hayabusa! It’s had a supercharger fitted to it, and as a result, its 1.3-litre 4-cylinder engine produces 385hp and 280Nm of torque! This power is sent to the rear wheels, and of course, it’s oh-so light, weighing in at 257kg. \n\nSo how will this one play out - will the electric power of the Tesla propel it to victory? Or will either the Koenigsegg or Hayabusa sneak it? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!\n\n\nMat’s quickest 1/4-mile EVER: https://bit.ly/Mats-Quickest-Launch-Ever\n\nFerrari SF90 v Tesla Model S Plaid v Porsche 911 Turbo S: https://bit.ly/Ferrari-SF90-v-Model-S-Plaid-v-911-Turbo\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"Koenigsegg v Tesla Plaid v Turbo Hayabusa: DRAG RACE","duration":1160,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6jMR7-NZMM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/J6jMR7-NZMM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3413734}}

And they were QUICKER than Ferrari, Aston Martin and Porsche!\n\nIt’s a Next-Gen Camaro that has been adapted to work at Le Mans. But if you missed it, you might be a bit confused about how this came about. \n\nNASCAR has changed a lot recently, with newer, more aerodynamic cars.\nCentre-lock wheels rather than the zzz,zzz,zzz,zzz,zzz lug nuts they used to run. \nThey’ve even moved to more F1-looking tyres rather than the old-style, tall-sidewall ones. Also adding a rear diffuser, typical on other race cars but very new for stock cars. \n\nBUT,  one of the bigger changes is that they are running more road courses than they used to, racing at tracks like Circuit of the Americas, Watkins Glen, and a favourite of mine - the Charlotte Roval.\nSo stock cars aren’t just for turning left, and they have shown that in recent seasons. But, not in the same way GT cars or prototypes can handle Le Mans for 24 hours though, right?\n\n\n📹 All source footage can be found here 👉  https://bit.ly/3CySBjZ\n\n➤Follow Driver61 on:\n   ➤ Instagram- @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n   ➤TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok\n\n➤ Follow Scott on:\n   ➤ Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell\n   ➤ Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n\n#NASCAR #LeMans #Motorsport","title":"How NASCAR was FASTER than Ferrari at Le Mans","duration":640,"channel_id":"UCtbLA0YM6EpwUQhFUyPQU9Q","author":"Driver61","date":"20230617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNIEgqZBScw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kNIEgqZBScw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":756362}}

Taking inspiration from Palm Springs midcentury modernism they’ve created a whimsical fuchsia pink fantasy where slides replace stairs and there’s not a wall in sight–when touring this impressive set it’s hard not to feel a rush of playful nostalgia as Greta states “I wanted to capture what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses.\" Barbie hits theaters on July 21.\r\n\r\nPromotional Consideration BARBIE from Warner Bros.

{"description":"Spain and Italy clashed in the UEFA Nations League Semifinals. Both teams came in hot with early goals in the first minutes of the half. Spain's Yeremy Pino smashed in a beautiful goal in the second minute to show their fury. Italy retaliated when Ciro Immobile scored an equalizer in the 11th minute. After the intense fist half, defenses tightened up until Spain found their opening in the 88th minute when Mato Joselu launched a rocket in the back of the net.

{"description":"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nAshley Pointer | June 14, 2023\nIt's practically a sin to not have Durrell \"Tank\" Babbs on your spiciest playlist — he's penned some of the steamiest records in R&B. If you've been following our Black Music Month takeover, it's likely you spotted Tank accompanying Babyface, the love maestro himself, on background vocals. In his own concert, the veteran crooner and R&B scholar performed a 14-song medley of passionate love songs and bedroom bops from across his 23 years-long career in music, and turned the Tiny Desk into \"the big, nasty Desk.\"\n\nThis doesn't happen without warning: \"Some of these songs make you wanna make up. Some of these songs make you wanna breakup and some of these songs make you want to participate in various sexual activities,\" Tank declared before traversing his catalog. Backed by the phenomenal Florida-based MVP Band, along with a trio of famed background vocalists — singer-songwriter-actor Luke James, singer Brooke Valentine and songwriter/producer Lonny Bereal — we got a taste of the songs that not only established Tank as a pillar in R&B, but hits he wrote and produced for other notable artists such as Jamie Foxx, Omarion, Marques Houston and LeToya Luckett.\n\nFull of buttery smooth runs and yearning melodies (along with the occasional, witty HR joke), Tank's Tiny Desk concert is a stellar display of how powerful the allure of R&B can be, and perhaps a masterclass for any youngin' learning how to woo.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Slowly\"\n\"Coldest\"\n\"Do What It Do\"\n\"O\"\n\"Naked\"\n\"Regret\"\n\"When We\"\n\"Dirty\"\n\"Can't Let It Show\"\n\"Slow\"\n\"See Through Love\"\n\"Maybe I Deserve\"\n\"I Deserve\"\n\"Please Don't Go\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTank: vocals\nLonny Bereal: vocals\nBrooke Valentine: vocals\nLuke James: vocals\nLa'Chaz Holloway: guitar\nAlex Hill: keys\nJevon Hill: keys, vocals\nArthur Jones: bass\nJimmy Hill: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nEditor: Maia Stern\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel, Kara Frame\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Josh Rogosin, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #tank","title":"Tank: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1097,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230614","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmBxJ2VcUk0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmBxJ2VcUk0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":986844}}

{"description":"And it could swing the 2024 elections.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn 2013, a divided Supreme Court gutted one of the major pillars of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In the 10 years since then, the court has moved even farther to the right. So when the Voting Rights Act came before the Supreme Court again in 2022, it didn’t look good for the law. But then something completely unexpected happened: in a 5-4 decision, two of the conservative justices voted with the 3 liberal justices to preserve the Voting Rights Act. And the effects could be huge.\n\nAt stake in the case was the way that Alabama divides up its Congressional districts. Alabama has seven districts, one of which is what’s called a “majority-minority district” in which Black Americans are the majority of the population. In 2022, a group of Black voters sued the state, saying that under the law, Alabama should actually have two majority-minority districts. And the Supreme Court agreed.\n\nThe reason this matters to the rest of the country is that Alabama’s not alone — several other states in the south are now vulnerable to similar challenges that would increase the number of majority-minority districts. And especially in a region of the country where voting is racially polarized — where white people overwhelmingly vote Republican and Black people vote Democrat — this decision has the potential to flip multiple Congressional seats in the next election. And in a US House of Representatives where Republicans only hold control by a margin of 10 votes or so, that’s a big deal.\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nIn 2021 every state in the US with more than one Congressional district redrew them. CNN has a great tool that looks at each state’s Congressional district map before and after that redistricting, and tracks how many majority-minority districts each state has: https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/georgia-redistricting-map/\n\nFiveThirtyEight has a similar tool: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps\n\nMany of those new district maps are under legal challenge. The Brennan Center for Justice has a really thorough roundup of every legal case underway against those maps: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/redistricting-litigation-roundup-0\n\nThe Brennan Center also has a great summary of the Alabama case: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/merrill-v-milligan-gerrymandering-supreme-court\n\nA big part of the Alabama case was determining whether drawing a second majority-black district would be easy. The mathematician Moon Duchin wrote a brief report for the court that demonstrates that really succinctly: https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Duchin_Report.pdf\n\nThe Guardian built a cool interactive that shows the gerrymandering in Alabama really well: https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/08/alabama-discrimination-black-voters-map-supreme-court\n\nNaturally I recommend reading Vox.com’s Ian Millhiser breaking down the Alabama decision: https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/8/23753932/supreme-court-john-roberts-milligan-allen-voting-rights-act-alabama-racial-gerrymandering\n\nAnd Vox’s Christian Paz on the political implications of the case: https://www.vox.com/voting-rights/23754443/supreme-court-alabama-voting-rights-act-congress-democrats-house-louisiana-south-carolina\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"An out-of-this-world teaser trailer for Disney and Pixar’s 28th feature film, “Elio,” are now available. Additions to the voice cast include: Jameela Jamil and Brad Garrett join previously announced America Ferrera and Yonas Kibreab in the intergalactic misadventure that is scheduled to take off next spring—March 1, 2024.\n \nFor centuries, people have called out to the universe looking for answers—in Disney and Pixar’s all-new movie “Elio,” the universe calls back! The original feature film introduces Elio, an underdog with an active imagination who finds himself inadvertently beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. Mistakenly identified as Earth’s ambassador to the rest of the universe, and completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be. \n \nDirected by Adrian Molina (screenwriter and co-director of “Coco”) and produced by Mary Alice Drumm (associate producer of “Coco”), the film features the voices of America Ferrera as Elio’s mom, Olga; Jameela Jamil as Ambassador Questa; Brad Garrett as Ambassador Grigon; and Yonas Kibreab as the title character. “Elio” releases in theaters March 1, 2024.\n\nFacebook:  https://Facebook.com/Pixar\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/pixar\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pixar","title":"Elio | Teaser Trailer","duration":129,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20230613","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w_K3CB8PuE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2w_K3CB8PuE/hqdefault.jpg?v=648892cb","content":{"View count":3659647}}

I have never built anything like this before and the fact that I live in hot Colorado, instead of cold Norway like the previous record holders, made this extremely difficult. We even had to build a hidden cooling chamber in the cone to prevent the ice cream from melting too quickly and had to create our own chocolate in order to get all of the waffles to stick. This video had lots of ups and downs, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible and we actually broke the world record! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I love ice cream !\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot WORLDS BIGGEST ICE CREAM SUNDAE CHALLENGE, But Most ice cream scoops balanced on a cone, But I Built The World's Largest Lego Tower, But I Made The World's Largest Pizza (132 Feet), But Worlds Largest Working Computer, But Massive Ice Cream Sundae Challenge (11,000 Calories), But Is This the World's Largest Ice Cream Bar, But TKOR Attempts The Biggest Ice Cream In The World, But I Built Logan Paul the World's Largest Gameboy, But I Built The World's Largest Minecraft Statue, But Tallest Ice Cream Cone, But I Built World’s Largest Minecraft Sword, or any other video like Airrack, Furious Pete, Matthew Beem, MrBeast, Guinness World Records, TKOR, or Matt Stonie would make.
