His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.

{"description":"Sponsor: Fractal Pop Air RGB Case on Amazon https://geni.us/TMxbP\nNVIDIA just announced the new GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080 16GB, and RTX 4080 12GB. The new cards use the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture and are priced at $900 for the 4080 12GB, $1200 for the RTX 4080 16GB, and $1600 for the RTX 4090 24GB cards. In this video, we also talk about the specs -- like CUDA core count, RT (ray tracing) performance expectations, power utilization and consumption targets, and memory bandwidth. NVIDIA additionally announced DLSS 3, which is a major step revision over DLSS 2 and could have wider-reaching implications outside of just the GPU space (and could impact CPU bottlenecked scenarios as well). We also briefly talk about some of the architectural changes, but we’ll leave most of those until after NVIDIA’s architectural briefing with the press.\n\nGrab the BRAND NEW GN ‘Amp’ Medium Modmat on the store and support our independent reviews, testing, and journalism: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/medium-modmat-v2\n\nEVGA DROPPED NVIDIA.

To top things off I hiked to a massive Budda statue, went on a boat tour to the most beautiful islands in the world, even got to swim with elephants!

{"description":"-An overview of the drama unfolding over the ship channel in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n-Preorder my new book before the holiday rush: https://practical.engineering/book\n\nErrata:\nAt 3:21, a clarification: The ships can't enter the port empty (because they would have too much air draft). That means they can't be fully loaded in the inner harbor because they are already carrying some weight when they enter.\nAt 12:40, I meant to say \"20% above their capacity\"\n\nIn July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Sponsor: HYTE Y60 computer case on Amazon - https://geni.us/3ngWP\nEVGA has terminated its relationship with NVIDIA. EVGA will no longer be manufacturing video cards of any type, citing a souring relationship with NVIDIA as the cause (among other reasons that were minimized). EVGA will not be exploring relationships with AMD or Intel at this time, and the company will be downsizing imminently as it exits the video card market. Customers will still be covered by EVGA policies, but EVGA will no longer make RTX or other video cards. The company already made ~20 EVT samples of EVGA RTX 4090 FTW3 cards, but will not be moving to production and has killed all active projects pertaining to cards -- including KINGPIN cards.\n\nUntil 9/17/22, we are giving 10% of all GN store revenue to Cat Angels, a cat shelter non-profit we support local to us!

{"description":"A day in the life of a Japanese waitress in Tokyo working at a Japanese teppanyaki restaurant.  This is a typical work day for a waitress in the Japanese food industry and the typical working hours in Japan.  This is a look inside of Japanese work culture in Japanese restaurants.  Working in Japan is quite unique and depending on the industry may be a bit different from job to job, but many of the jobs also share similar characteristics.  The video follows Yuki in her typical japan work day from morning until the evening and everything that happens in between at work.  She arrives at the teppanyaki restaurant when it opens and leaves when it closes, very typical for Japanese restaurants.  Yuki is a waitress at Pandora, a Teppanyaki restaurant, Japanese style flat grill, which has been a local favorite since 1972 serving Kobe beef steaks and teppanyaki course meals. During her time working as a full-time waitress, she learned the importance of reading and anticipating the customers needs and acting beforehand.  It’s a strong part of a Japanese omotenashi culture, a deep and honest form of hospitality, treating customers with respect without asking for anything in return.  So for her, even a smile from her customers brings her true joy.  One of the main reasons why in Japan tips at the end of the meal are very uncustomary.  This among other things shared in this video is what makes working in Japan as a waitress very unique experience.\n\nWatch all of my Japan Day in the Life videos on this playlist\n- https://tokyozebra.com/ditl\n\nPandora Restaurant\n2F - https://maps.app.goo.gl/LnRPN96XcFRUyyPz5?g_st=ic\n4F - https://maps.app.goo.gl/yXDjN92hVCtffdddA?g_st=ic\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi3CubfpdU3GpoHtX1Cy46A\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?

It’s why in just one year’s time, he’s already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80’s hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song “Never Comin’ Home” amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, “Fall In Love”, “Rock and A Hard Place”, and “Where It Ends”. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #NeverLeave #LyricVideo","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Never Leave (Lyric Video)","duration":204,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20220915","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmz6EueDmpE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rmz6EueDmpE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":393336}}

{"description":"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an \"El Tiny\" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.\n\nFi O’Reilly | September 15, 2022\nWhat a way to get our second annual El Tiny series going! Omar Apollo kicks off Latinx Heritage Month with a full-band rendition of \"En El Olvido,\" backed by Las Mariachis Lindas, as he channels a childhood spent listening to Juan Gabriel into his performance of the Mexican corrido. \n\nIn the eternal wisdom of Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre, it's not a Mexican party until someone starts crying, and Apollo embraces esta melancolía as the band slips into the easy R&B number \"Evergreen.\"  \"We're about to get more sad,\" he says to the crowd with a grin. \n\nDespite the heartbreak and unrequited love songs, there's a sense of ease in this Tiny Desk concert — an easy camaraderie among the group as the members sing through \"Evergreen\" and \"Petrified\" before finishing with the (slightly) more upbeat \"Endlessly.\"  El corazón puede estar adolorido, but in community, the pain never seems hopeless. \n\nAs Apollo's Tiny Desk comes to an end, he offers the audience a homework assignment for self-improvement, for putting the negative behind you and making yourself available to participate in building community: \"I want y'all to think about something,” he says. “I want you to go home, I want you to meditate and I want you to just burn the bridge.\" He laughs. “I’m playing!” But as his and the band’s joyful energy attests, in the world of Omar Apollo, there’s only room for building each other up. \n\nSET LIST\n“En El Olvido”\n“Evergreen”\n“Petrified”\n“Endlessly”\n\nMUSICIANS\nOmar Apollo: vocals\nJonah Feingold: guitar\nJackson Shanks: drums\nManny Barajas: bass\nHarrison Hawkins: keys, music director\nAstyn Turrentine: vocals\nPhylicia Hill: vocals\nBrian Antonio Gazo Martinez: vocals\nFabian Anthony Chavez: saxophone\nMarcus Clayton Paul: trumpet\nSilvia Estrada: guitarrón\nMayra Martínez: guitarrón\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAnimator: Alanté Serene\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Pierre Kattar\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Copeland\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alanté Serene, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #ElTiny #OmarApollo","title":"Omar Apollo: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1093,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220915","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p78XATPcyg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7p78XATPcyg/hqdefault.jpg?v=632258af","content":{"View count":461721}}
