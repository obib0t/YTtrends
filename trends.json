{"description":"It's November 11, 2011. Todd Howard has just unleashed Skyrim into the world. No patches. Release build. Take his word for it: it just works. Join me today as I play through the original release of Skyrim, but every time I encounter a glitch, bug or exploit.. my health is reduced by 5. It's going to be quite a journey...  \n\nA HUGE THANK YOU TO Nighthawk and the Team at Skyblivion for helping duct tape together a working copy of the release build of skyrim for me! And No I cannot legally distribute it to you sorry...\n\nAs Bethesda have just released starfield that has been a relatively bug free game excluding all of the exploits I felt it was important to go back in time and see if we can compare the release build of skyrim to a starfield review of sorts. Now as Todd Howard would never lie and every one of his games have the it just works seal of gameplay approval it is impossible for us to have a non perfectly balanced experience! So begone Skyrim Anniversary edition because we are going to the original! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts.

Without question, it's a project that is much more difficult than we thought it would be but we're having fun along the way and that's what counts.

To keep busy we‚Äôve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMusicbed SyncID: \nMB01Q7KG9GU69QL","title":"Two Fruits and their Trees üíÖüèº","duration":1231,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20230924","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99zFtmFezoY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/99zFtmFezoY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":104043}}

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

But buckle up, because it's happening!\n\nWe all know how addictive TikTok can be ‚Äì one minute you're scrolling, and the next, you're attempting the latest viral dance in your living room. üï∫üíÉ But what if I told you that while we're getting our groove on, some traditional jobs might be in jeopardy? üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThink about it: with millions of users glued to their screens, companies are jumping on the TikTok bandwagon, using it as a unique marketing tool. üì¢üìà But what happens to jobs that once relied on more traditional advertising methods? Are billboards, magazine spreads, and even certain TV commercials becoming a thing of the past? üì∫üö´ Well, my friends, the writing might just be on the virtual wall.\n\nBut it's not just the ad world feeling the heat! üî•üåç Even some individuals with regular 9-to-5 gigs are striking out on their own, thanks to the platform's insane reach. Who knew that sharing your quirky talents or life hacks could turn into a full-time career? ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è From makeup artists to DIY gurus, TikTok is becoming a place where creativity equals cash.\n\nSo, is this a bad thing or just the natural evolution of the digital age? ü§î Are we witnessing a revolution that's putting power back into the hands of the people, or are we waving goodbye to certain job titles forever? üíîüëã One thing's for sure, my friends ‚Äì TikTok is rewriting the rulebook faster than we can say \"viral sensation\"!\n\nJoin me as we unravel this captivating and slightly controversial trend. I'll be chatting with experts, diving into stats, and, of course, adding my signature humor to the mix. ü§£üìä Don't forget to hit that like button, subscribe, and ring the notification bell ‚Äì you won't want to miss this eye-opening exploration into the impact of TikTok on our job market.
