{"description":"*** Preorder Cities:Skylines II and support the channel at the same time! ***\nhttps://www.nexus.gg/cityplannerplays/cities-skylines-ii \n\nIt's finally time to share another Cities Skylines 2 video!  And I've learned even more about the game since the last one.  But more then that, the game has improved a ton, too!   In this Cities Skylines 2 gameplay video, we'll continue to build Moundsville, which  is a city inspired by a real master plan; however, in this episode, Moundsville completely outgrows its plans as we add a ton of density.\n\nBut beyond just adding density, we'll also build some of the grittier parts of the city, including cargo rail and passenger rail infrastructure, a garbage incineration plant, a new solar power plant and battery backup, all of the specialized industries, and MASSIVE suburban expansions.  By the end, we'll add a ton of skyscrapers to the city.  \n\nStick around until after the tour when I'll give you my completely unvarnished views on the game.\n\nFYI - this is not a sponsored video, but I want to give a huge shout out to  @paradoxinteractive  and the  @CitiesSkylines  team for providing me early access to the game!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS VIDEOS IN SERIES\n\n‚ñ∫  First CS2 video: https://youtu.be/xm2yD9mXgPQ\n‚ñ∫ Seconds CS2 video: https://youtu.be/g9yESIzeyQ0\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFIND ME HERE\n\n‚ñ∫ Website: http://CityPlannerPlays.com \n‚ñ∫ Discord:  https://discord.gg/CityPlannerPlays\n‚ñ∫ Twitter:  https://twitter.com/cityplanneryt\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE CHANNEL, GET COOL PERKS!\n\n‚ñ∫ Merch Store:  https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Store\n‚ñ∫ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CityPlannerPlays\n‚ñ∫ YT Membership: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/YTMembership\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMY MUSIC\n\n‚ñ∫ Master Planned Music: Http://MasterPlannedMusic.com\n‚ñ∫ Epidemic Sound: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Epidemic\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMY GEAR\n\n‚ñ∫ Kit.co Link  https://kit.co/cityplannerplays\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLAYLISTS\n\n‚ñ∫ Ultimate Beginners Guide: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/BeginnersGuide\n‚ñ∫ Cities Skylines II: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/CS2\n‚ñ∫ Tutorials: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Tutorials\n‚ñ∫ Nicolet Bay: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/NicoletBay\n‚ñ∫ Verde Beach: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/VerdeBeach\n‚ñ∫ Clearwater County: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/ClearwaterCounty\n‚ñ∫ Abandoned City Fix: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/AbandonedCity\n‚ñ∫ Sustainable City: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/SustainableCity\n‚ñ∫ Bluffside Crossing: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Bluffside\n‚ñ∫ City Tips: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/CityTips\n‚ñ∫ Previous Live Streams: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Streams\n‚ñ∫ Timberborn: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Timberborn\n‚ñ∫ Other Games: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/OtherGames\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHASHTAGS\n\n#CitiesSkylines2 #cityplannerplays\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHAPTERS\n\nSeries Recap and Off Camera Fixes! - 0:00\nI'm the Trash Man! - 2:37\nALL of the Rail - 6:04\nThe Suburbs - 17:46\nSolar - 32:01\nSpecialized Industry - 37:04\nIncreasing Density - 46:34\nCity Tour - 53:52\nHow I feel about the game after 143 hours - 55:30","title":"After 143 hours playing Cities Skylines 2, I built THIS city and have a few thoughts...","duration":3598,"channel_id":"UC8WAaaW2FnctRI9coYJoUdA","author":"City Planner Plays","date":"20231011","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P21vSG4Adwc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P21vSG4Adwc/hqdefault.jpg?v=65265560","content":{"View count":391477}}

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents.

{"description":"Gabriel Martinelli‚Äôs late deflected strike gave us a huge win against Champions Manchester City at Emirates Stadium.\n\nIn a game with little goalmouth action throughout, it was left to substitute Martinelli ‚Äì on his first appearance since the middle of September ‚Äì to score the only goal of the game, and move us above Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men in the table.\n\nIt ended a run of 12 consecutive defeats against City, and it‚Äôs a victory that could yet prove significant come the end of the season.\n\nAs usual, the atmosphere inside Emirates Stadium was electric at kick off. Both sides knew top spot in the Premier League was up for grabs.\n\nIt was the visitors who had the first sight of goal. From their first corner of the afternoon, Josko Gvardiol hooked goalwards, but Declan Rice was well placed to head off the line. The danger was not cleared though, until Nathan Ake blazed over when the ball fell to him inside the area.\n\nIt was a big let off early on, and there was another on the quarter hour. We were playing the ball around at the back, but David Raya spent just too long in possession, Julian Alvarez closed him down and the keeper‚Äôs attempted clearance clattered against the Argentine and just wide of his own post.\n\nWe needed to get into the game, and Eddie Nketiah did well to work a shooting opportunity inside the area, but flashed his effort wide.\n\nWe began to come back into the game, the intensity increased and there was a flashpoint when Mateo Kovacic dived in late on Martin Odegaard. He was only shown a yellow card, despite a VAR review.\n\nWithin minutes the Croatian then fouled Declan Rice with a similar lunge, but to the amazement of the Emirates faithful, the referee kept his cards in his pocket.\n\nWe were having our best spell of the half, and Alex Zinchenko had two speculative shots from the edge of the area blocked.\n\nMikel Arteta introduced Gabriel Martinelli for the second half, the Brazilian returning to action after missing the last five games with injury.\n\nHe took up his usual position on the left, replacing Leandro Trossard, with Gabriel Jesus on the opposite flank. After a run of 87 consecutive appearances in the Premier League, Bukayo Saka was not involved at all.\n\nMartinelli struck our first shot on target five minutes after coming on. He was set up by Declan Rice, but the angle was always against him.\n\nThe pace of the game began to drop, and chances were scarce for either side. As we entered the final 15 minutes, Arteta made a triple change, bringing on Kai Havertz, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Thomas Partey.\n\nThree of the four subs combined for the goal.\n\nTomiyasu laid off a long pass to Havertz just inside the area, who in turn passed back to Martinelli. His shot was on target, but completely wrong-footed Ederson when it smashed off Nathan Ake‚Äôs face.\n\nThe Emirates erupted. We had barely been troubled at the back, but now we had a lead to see out.\n\nWe managed it without much cause for alarm, to extend our unbeaten start in the Premier League, and finally get one over last season‚Äôs treble-winners.\n\n#arsenal \n\n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"The Grant: https://forms.gle/HBtAdt7zedrtzbZ48\nPizzamas: https://pizzamas.com/discount/HANKSENTME\n\nAs I upload this, I am realizing that there is a pretty huge part of my life that I barely ever talk about publicly. I mean, that is also somewhat true of family things, but business isn't traditionally seen as a thing to be private about. There are lots of people who have big, full careers just talking about the business of their business. I myself have felt the pull to create that kind of content and have done it!\n\nBut I stopped a while back as I realized that talking about the inside operations of my business was always sharing other people's stories as well as my own, and that's weird without asking for permission. Plus, my perception of a situation is never going to be exactly the same as someone else's. So I stopped doing it. I even put a little sign on my computer that says \"DON'T TWEET ABOUT WORK\" to remind me. Even this video felt like it was on the edge of sharing too much, though it is almost all about me. \n\nI feel like there's a relationship between the \"I tweet about what a good boss I am boss\" and the \"wife guy.\" And we've seen times when those bosses hve proved that they are not great bosses. I am also not a great boss...I know that there are some out there, but it's not an easy thing to do. It's especially hard when you have both the inclination and opportunity to be constantly distracted by other things!\n\nSo yeah, that's why I don't talk about the biggest part of my professional life on the internet. If my businesses were just my business, I would, but it's not. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com","title":"I Quit","duration":576,"channel_id":"UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA","author":"vlogbrothers","date":"20231006","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjz3lGV6Tuw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jjz3lGV6Tuw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":650699}}
