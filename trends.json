We explore that using numbers generated from our last episode, where the Z06 beat a Porsche 911 GT3 (992), an Audi R8 V10 Performance, and almost kept up with a Ducati Panigale V4 SP2.\n\nUsing his signature time-freeze technique, veteran automotive journalist Jason Cammisa shows us the outcome of the race and explains how it happened by walking back through slow-mo time at the finish line.\n\nThe Corvette E-Ray combines the Z06's wide body with the base Stingray's 6.2-liter LS2 V-8 and a front-mounted, 160-hp electric motor. Launches are now wheelspin-free and no-drama as the E-Ray rockets from 0-60 in just 2.4 seconds — making this the quickest Corvette in history.\n\nAnd, at 3925 lb, the heaviest.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"We SPILLED CORN While Loading the Truck!

{"description":"Today AD is welcomed to Columbus, Ohio by Debby Ryan and Josh Dun for a tour of their fascinating, ‘treehouse fantasy’ home. It might be surprising to hear of a sparkling young actor and her rocker husband setting up their first house in the “Arch City,” but Ryan and Dun relish an impulsive departure from the script. When they discovered the property and decided to make it their home, the actor and musician tapped Fawn Galli and Ashley Moyer to bring their domestic dream to life. From a basement boxing ring and a cold-plunge pool on the back porch, to a recording studio and a dramatic stone bust of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, that dream has come to full fruition. “I remember walking through the house and feeling like there was so much room to put our personalities into it,” says Dun. “Not only was this the first house that we designed together, but it was really the first time that both of us felt the freedom to put our mark on a place.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Debby and Josh's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-debby-ryan-and-josh-duns-treehouse-fantasy-home-in-columbus-ohio\r\n\r\nShop Debby and Josh’s home style!\r\n\r\nPlants/accessories:\r\nPolspotten Set of 4 Tattoo Cups: https://fave.co/40cH4Rc\r\nStagg Electric Kettle: https://amzn.to/42o4wge\r\n(Similar) Olivia & May 2 Piece Modern Ceramic Planter Pots: https://goto.target.com/4P5jaG\r\nHero Giant Corn Stool: https://amzn.to/3n8oyuO\r\n(Similar) Super Moss Deco Moss Small Mushroom: https://amzn.to/42ouCj7\r\n(Similar) Pose Mirror Hand Embellished: https://fave.co/3JTGe6D\r\nOpalhouse Outdoor Ceramic Planter: https://goto.target.com/9gGaVQ\r\nByredo Tree House Candle: https://fave.co/3LFYt0u\r\nMasion Margiela ‘REPLICA’ By The Fireplace Candle: https://fave.co/3JVwXuR\r\n(Similar) Sizikato Frog Incense Burner: https://amzn.to/3JVqHDn\r\nAcrylic Four in a Row: https://fave.co/3Z7cAyR\r\nPlunge The Cold Plunge: https://fave.co/402EsWb\r\n\r\nLighting:\r\nUrban Outfitters Wally Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3lpHxkj\r\nElk Home Transit Chandelier: https://fave.co/3Jvd5gG\r\nEtsy Gallery Paint Co.

Munetaka Murakami would answer with a solo home run of his own. Kazuma Okamoto would hit a solo home run of his own in the fourth inning and Japan would take a 3-1 lead. In the 8th inning, Kyle Schwarber gave the USA some hope as he launched a solo home run. Shohei Ohtani would enter in the ninth inning where he would strike out his teammate, Mike Trout to end the game and Japan won the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n\n#FOXSports #WBC #USAvsJapan\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Sports content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n\n►First Things First’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\n►The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n►SPEAK's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n▶The Carton Show's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBONFOX\n \nLike Fox Sports on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/FOXSPORTSFacebook\nFollow Fox Sports on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/FOXSPORTSTwitter \nFollow Fox Sports on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/FOXSPORTSInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Sports:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Sports' YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

Thankfully, when it comes to horsepower, Dodge isn't in the business of disappointing. That's also why for the grand finale it resurrected the Demon moniker and built the ultimate streetable dragster. Enter the 2023 Challenger SRT Demon 170.

{"description":"Months after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, I began filming the U.S. Army’s 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment (known as the Gunners) in Baghdad. The unit was housed in a bombed-out palace on the banks of the Tigris that they named Gunner Palace.\n\nRather than just making a movie about the men, I suggested that we make a film together — an offer that the soldiers quickly embraced. They told the story of the war as only they could: They played guitar, spat out rhymes and played to the camera. But behind all their bravado and posturing, they were just kids who desperately wanted the world to understand the war through their eyes.\n\nIn the last two months of 2003, the Gunners lost three men to I.E.D. attacks. They scrambled to create makeshift armor for their soft-skinned vehicles using scrap metal. When asked by a soldier about the lack of armor in 2004, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said, “You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.”\n\nThey were the army we had. They fought an enemy they couldn’t always see in a land they didn’t understand for reasons that were never entirely clear. In the midst of the pandemic, I visited the men and spoke with them about how they make sense of their role in a war that has yet to be fully reckoned with. In \"The Army We Had,\" the veterans grapple with a past that still reverberates powerfully through their lives.\n\n- Text by Michael Tucker\n- Film by Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker\n\nMore from The New York Times Video: \nOp-Docs: https://www.nytimes.com/column/op-docs\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n​​\nWatch all of our videos here: http://nytimes.com/video​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nytvideo​​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nytvideo​​\n----------\nOp-Docs is a forum for short, opinionated documentaries by independent filmmakers.

And make sure to follow me @safiyany on flip :)\n\nAnd thanks so much to Julia from Agile Styling for her consult! You can find her website and find out more about her color matching and styling services here: https://www.agilestyling.com/\n\nAnd follow her on TikTok & Instagram at: @agile_styling !\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! Today it’s all about color - and as someone who is known for wearing almost only black, I decided to dip my toes into the personal color analysis trend I've been hearing about for years and seeing all over TikTok. Because I've always been curious... am I a winter? Autumn? Summer? Or even Spring? Pastels have never been my forte, but I was open to at least *hearing* about them. So, we took a little detour to Toronto and visited Julia Dobkine from Agile Styling, an expert in color analysis who I’d been following on Tiktok, to find out my colors, my season, my tones, and everything underneath those tones. What do you guys think? Would you try this?\n\nAlso, thanks to the virtual color analysts, the color key, for their help in fact-checking the video and collaborating on celebrities for the 12 seasons for our graphics! To learn your season virtually, check out @‌thecolorkey_ on Instagram! **celebrities shown here are examples based on the color key's best classification done in good faith but without participation in the color key analysis process.

In this video, we continue our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age.

{"description":"Robin Hilton | March 17, 2023\nIt's hard to overstate the kindness and good-natured humor Bono and The Edge brought to the Tiny Desk. When they first arrived at the NPR Music offices, Bono spoke on an imaginary phone, \"The talent's here! The talent's coming through,\" poking fun at their own fame, while carrying The Edge's guitar. (The Edge called Bono the best roadie he's ever had.) The two never stopped beaming, like two overjoyed newcomers thrilled at the chance to play for someone.\n\nThe performance was a preview of U2's new album, Songs Of Surrender, featuring stripped-down versions of songs from across the band's catalog. To help pull off several reimagined songs from the 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, Bono and The Edge invited a teen choir from the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, D.C., to join them. During rehearsals, Bono told the students to think of \"Beautiful Day\" as the kind of \"post-drinking\" singalong you'd bellow with friends after leaving a bar. He then quickly realized none of them are old enough to drink, before feigning a heart attack.\n\nTraveling without bassist Adam Clayton or drummer Larry Mullen Jr., Bono and The Edge made the trip from Ireland to the States specifically for the Tiny Desk, arriving in D.C. after five days of rehearsals at Bono's New York apartment. When they settled in for the performance, they treated the office to four songs, including a deeply emotional version of \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of,\" written for the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence, and a reworked version of \"Walk On,\" which Bono said was inspired by and dedicated to the people of Ukraine.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Beautiful Day\"\n\"In a Little While\"\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\"\n\"Walk On\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBono: vocals\nThe Edge: guitar, vocals\nDuke Ellington School of the Arts Choir: Petra Munter, Ayan Yacob, Kirsten Holmes, Jayla Norwood, Dyor Taylor, Jaylyn Pickney, Jevon Skipper, Joshua Jennings, Jordan Freeman\nPatrick Lundy: choir director\nSpecial thanks to: Sandi Logan (principal/HOS), Isaac Daniel (assistant principal)\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nEditor: Maia Stern\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel, Michael Zamora \nAudio Assistant: Alex Drewenskus\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galván\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #u2 #bono #theedge","title":"Bono and The Edge: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1272,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230317","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxo-loXdcH0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oxo-loXdcH0/hqdefault.jpg?v=64126762","content":{"View count":1216620}}

The hilarious and unapologetically explicit story of identity and self-discovery centers on four unlikely friends who embark on a once-in-a-lifetime international adventure. When Audrey’s (Ashley Park) business trip to Asia goes sideways, she enlists the aid of Lolo (Sherry Cola), her irreverent, childhood best friend who also happens to be a hot mess; Kat (Stephanie Hsu), her college friend turned Chinese soap star; and Deadeye (Sabrina Wu), Lolo’s eccentric cousin. Their no-holds-barred, epic experience becomes a journey of bonding, friendship, belonging, and wild debauchery that reveals the universal truth of what it means to know and love who you are. \n\nAlso starring Ronny Chieng (Crazy Rich Asians), Lori Tan Chinn (Awkwafina is Nora From Queens), David Denman (Greenland), Annie Mumolo (Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar), Desmond Chiam (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier), Alexander Hodge (Insecure), and Chris Pang (Crazy Rich Asians).","title":"Joy Ride (2023) Official Red Band Trailer - Ashley Park, Sherry Cola, Stephanie Hsu, Sabrina Wu","duration":152,"channel_id":"UCJ6nMHaJPZvsJ-HmUmj1SeA","author":"Lionsgate Movies","date":"20230317","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyI-AM5VXDo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jyI-AM5VXDo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":515184}}
