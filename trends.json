During his battle with cancer Chadwick kept it a secret from almost everyone around him and thus Marvel didn't even know that he had the disease. Going back and watching his performances it's incredible that he was even able to deliver to the level that he did and it's a testament to how strong of a person that he was. He's obviously left a big hole and we know that this film will very much centre around the mantle being passed. Due to controversies around Leticia Wright there's been a lot of different rumours over whether she's gonna get the mantle or not and from this first look it seems like there might even be multiple people vying for it. This movie is also going to be introducing Namor, RiRi Williams and it will center around the war between Wakanda and Atlantis.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but if you could smash that thumbs up button and also subscribe for Heavy Spoilers forever. With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into the trailer.\n\n-\n\nOk so the trailer itself is extremely somber and we open with a cover of Bob Marley's no woman no cry. Marley sadly passed away at the age of 36 and us being robbed of an icon is something that feels like it might be echoing the death of Chadwick Boseman. I hope I don't sound disrespectful there but it's just kind of the emotion and reason behind this song choice. Really got me teary eyed and this is one of the most beautiful trailers I've ever watched. His imagery is laced throughout the teaser and we also get what I believe might even be the funeral of T'Challa. How he dies we don't really get to see but there's this strong focus on him with him even getting his own mural. They of course did something similar in Far From Home with Tony Stark but here it feels infinitely more impactful due to the real life knowledge that we have about the actor.\n\nMusic - LAKEY INSPIRED - Arcade\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired","title":"BLACK PANTHER Wakanda Forever Trailer Breakdown | Easter Eggs, Hidden Details & Characters Explained","duration":947,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20220724","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMgNkh5AiYI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HMgNkh5AiYI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":662317}}

{"description":"Dream Dangerously. Enter the world of THE SANDMAN on August 5, only on Netflix.\n\nThere is another world that waits for all of us when we close our eyes and sleep — a place called the Dreaming, where The Sandman, Master of Dreams (Tom Sturridge), gives shape to all of our deepest fears and fantasies. But when Dream is unexpectedly captured and held prisoner for a century, his absence sets off a series of events that will change both the dreaming and waking worlds forever. To restore order, Dream must journey across different worlds and timelines to mend the mistakes he’s made during his vast existence, revisiting old friends and foes, and meeting new entities — both cosmic and human — along the way.\n\nBased on the beloved award-winning DC comic series written by Neil Gaiman, THE SANDMAN is a rich, character-driven blend of myth and dark fantasy woven together over the course of ten epic chapters following Dream’s many adventures. Developed and executive produced by Gaiman, showrunner Allan Heinberg, and David S. Goyer.\n\nWatch The Sandman, only on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/thesandman\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 221 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

{"description":"Discover the legend that forged the rings. September 2 on Prime Video. #TheRingsOfPower\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power - SDCC Trailer","duration":182,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220722","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYnQDsaxHZU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYnQDsaxHZU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":8242381}}

{"description":"Amy was willing to do anything to get Sonic to notice her. She just wanted Sonic and Amy to become a thing. A Sonamy thing. And that’s where Tails came in. In an effort to cross the Sonic frontiers – from friendship to relationship – Amy Rose had the two-tailed fox head up her transformation into what she thought would be the dream girl of Sonic the Hedgehog. But, has that resulted in her being able to call herself Mrs. Sonic Hedgehog? Well… you’ll see.\n\nThis isn’t a Sonic Origins story. This isn’t some Sonic game to the pink-haired girl. In fact, she’s got a bad case of Sonic mania. What began as a romantic comedy in her mind, has turned into a Sonic vs Amy nightmare for her. Forget Sonic exe: Amy exe has entered the chat. If the blue blur isn’t careful, he may go from Sonic Intact to Sonic Boom. \n\nProduced by Tom Jenkins and Ben Michael\nWritten by Jason Dewey and Ben Michael\nPre-Production and Animatic by Ben \"Wonchop\" Smallman\nRough Animation, Cleanup and Colour by Ben \"Wonchop\" Smallman, BillyBCreations (https://www.youtube.com/user/BillyBcreations), \nBackgrounds by Eric Oleander (https://twitter.com/eric_oleander)\nCompositing by Liam McKeown\nVoice of Amy & Tails by Eileen 'EileMonty' Montgomery\nVoice of Sonic by Blake Swift\nEdit, Music Curation and Sound Design by Jason Dewey\n\nWATCH MORE MASHED CARTOONS!\n\nThere's Something About Amy\nhttps://youtu.be/F3Vtuo5KGLk\n\nSONIC CARTOON COLLECTION (Volume 2)\nhttps://youtu.be/4azPQAb-c2Y\n\n🔴 Subscribe to Mashed now so you never miss a new video!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mashed\n\nKeep in touch & stay up to date on all things #Mashed!\n\n👻 Mashed Snapchat: https://bit.ly/mashedsnapchat \n\n📘 Mashed Facebook: http://facebook.com/thisismashed\n\n🐦Mashed Twitter: http://twitter.com/mashed\n \n📸 Mashed Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thisismashed\n\n🎵 Mashed Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thisismashed\n\n📧 Mashed Email: mashed@theconnectedset.com","title":"There's Something About Amy (Part 2)","duration":267,"channel_id":"UCCn62cYVpl0e_GN-yo1H9yQ","author":"mashed","date":"20220721","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgdibL7jqhc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PgdibL7jqhc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1859475}}

{"description":"Are you ready to live the life you deserve? \n#DontWorryDarling \nOnly in theaters September 23.\n\nFrom New Line Cinema comes “Don’t Worry Darling,” directed by Olivia Wilde (“Booksmart”) and starring Florence Pugh (Oscar-nominated for “Little Women”), Harry Styles (“Dunkirk”), Wilde (upcoming “Babylon”), Gemma Chan (“Crazy Rich Asians”), KiKi Layne (“The Old Guard”) and Chris Pine (“All the Old Knives”). \n\nAlice (Pugh) and Jack (Styles) are lucky to be living in the idealized community of Victory, the experimental company town housing the men who work for the top-secret Victory Project and their families. The 1950’s societal optimism espoused by their CEO, Frank (Pine)—equal parts corporate visionary and motivational life coach—anchors every aspect of daily life in the tight-knit desert utopia.\n\nWhile the husbands spend every day inside the Victory Project Headquarters, working on the “development of progressive materials,” their wives—including Frank’s elegant partner, Shelley (Chan)—get to spend their time enjoying the beauty, luxury and debauchery of their community. Life is perfect, with every resident’s needs met by the company. All they ask in return is discretion and unquestioning commitment to the Victory cause.\n\nBut when cracks in their idyllic life begin to appear, exposing flashes of something much more sinister lurking beneath the attractive façade, Alice can’t help questioning exactly what they’re doing in Victory, and why. Just how much is Alice willing to lose to expose what’s really going on in this paradise?\n\nAn audacious, twisted and visually stunning psychological thriller, “Don’t Worry Darling” is a powerhouse feature from director Olivia Wilde that boasts intoxicating performances from Florence Pugh and Harry Styles, surrounded by the impressive and pitch-perfect cast.\n\nThe film also stars Nick Kroll (“How It Ends”), Sydney Chandler (“Pistol”), Kate Berlant (“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood”), Asif Ali (“WandaVision”), Douglas Smith (“Big Little Lies”), Timothy Simons (“Veep”) and Ari’el Stachel (upcoming “Respect the Jux”).\n\nWilde directs from a screenplay penned by her “Booksmart” writer Katie Silberman, based on a story by Carey Van Dyke & Shane Van Dyke (“Chernobyl Diaries”) and Silberman. The film is produced by Wilde, Silberman, Miri Yoon and Roy Lee, with Richard Brener, Celia Khong, Alex G. Scott, Catherine Hardwicke, Carey Van Dyke and Shane Van Dyke executive producing.\n\nWilde is joined behind the camera by two-time Oscar-nominated director of photography Matthew Libatique (“A Star Is Born,” “Black Swan”), production designer Katie Byron (“Booksmart”), editor Affonso Gonçalves (“The Lost Daughter”), Oscar-nominated composer John Powell (“Jason Bourne”), music supervisor Randall Poster (“No Time to Die”) and costume designer Arianne Phillips (“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood”).\n\nA New Line Cinema presentation, “Don’t Worry Darling” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on September 23, 2022 and internationally beginning 21 September 2022.","title":"Don't Worry Darling | Official Trailer #2","duration":176,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

{"description":"Danni Sanders (Zoey Deutch), an aimless aspiring writer with no friends, no romantic prospects and — worst of all — no followers, fakes an Instagram-friendly trip to Paris in the hopes of boosting her social media clout. When a terrifying incident strikes the City of Lights, Danni unwittingly falls into a lie bigger than she ever imagined. She \"returns\" a hero, even striking up an unlikely friendship with Rowan (Mia Isaac), a real trauma survivor dedicated to societal change, and scooping up the man of her dreams Colin (Dylan O'Brien). As an influencer and advocate, Danni finally has the life and audience she always wanted. But it’s only a matter of time before the façade cracks, and she learns the hard way that the Internet loves a takedown. \n\nCast: Zoey Deutch, Dylan O'Brien, Mia Isaac\n\nSubscribe To Searchlight Pictures: https://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures\n\n#NotOkayMovie #ZoeyDeutch #DylanOBrien #Searchlight \n\nConnect with Searchlight Online\nVisit the Searchlight WEBSITE: https://www.searchlightpictures.com/\nLike Searchlight on FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/searchlightpics\n\nNOT OKAY | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures","title":"NOT OKAY | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures","duration":156,"channel_id":"UCor9rW6PgxSQ9vUPWQdnaYQ","author":"SearchlightPictures","date":"20220721","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvby6Z0vWmA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xvby6Z0vWmA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1898282}}

{"description":"Halloween Ends\n10.14.22\nhttps://www.halloweenmovie.com/\n\nThis is Laurie Strode’s last stand. \n\nAfter 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive. \n\nIcon Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the last time as Laurie Strode, horror’s first “final girl” and the role that launched Curtis’ career. Curtis has portrayed Laurie for more than four decades now, one of the longest actor-character pairings in cinema history. When the franchise relaunched in 2018, Halloween shattered box office records, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing chapter and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a horror film starring a woman. \n\nFour years after the events of last year’s Halloween Kills, Laurie is living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and is finishing writing her memoir. Michael Myers hasn’t been seen since. Laurie, after allowing the specter of Michael to determine and drive her reality for decades, has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell; The Hardy Boys, Virgin River), is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can’t control, once and for all. \n\nHalloween Ends co-stars returning cast Will Patton as Officer Frank Hawkins, Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and James Jude Courtney as The Shape.  \n\nFrom the creative team that relaunched the franchise with 2018’s Halloween and Halloween Kills, the film is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Paul Brad Logan (Manglehorn), Chris Bernier (The Driver series), Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Halloween Ends is produced by Malek Akkad, Jason Blum and Bill Block. The executive producers are John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Ryan Freimann, Ryan Turek, Andrew Golov, Thom Zadra and Christopher H. Warner. \n\nUniversal Pictures, Miramax and Blumhouse present a Malek Akkad production, in association with Rough House Pictures. \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/halloweenmovie/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/halloweenmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HalloweenMovie/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics?lang=en","title":"Halloween Ends - Official Trailer","duration":76,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20220720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mAWKyfj6c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/i_mAWKyfj6c/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3084001}}

{"description":"Machine Gun Kelly ft. glaive - more than life (Official Live Performance) \n\nWhether rapping, as he did in the early part of his career, or rocking, as he's doing these days, Machine Gun Kelly is one of those artists who starts fierce and gets fiercer. That impact comes from the punch of emotion at the core of his tunes - the guy comes on strong from the get-go. You can hear it on 2012's \"Wild Boy\" from his 'Lace Up' debut, and it's there on both the 'BINGE' and 'bloom' albums from a few years ago. In May, Billboard said \"there’s no one on the charts serving balls-to-the-wall rock’n’roll decadence like the 31-year-old musician.\" It's hard to disagree. Since he turned a punk-pop corner with blistering guitar tracks such as \"bloody valentine\" - a blitzkrieg bop if there ever was one - the Halsey duet \"forget me too,\" and his blackbear romp \"my ex's best friend,\" he's moved from respected cool guy to flat-out superstar. And he takes the success in stride; the name of his latest album is 'mainstream sellout.' If you caught the Billboard Awards in May, you know he poured it all out in his performance of \"Twin Flame.\" So much so that his sweetie Megan Fox tweeted her approval in a gushing example of PDA. \"Baby – so proud of you for giving such a vulnerable and emotional performance. You are magic.\" Fans will think something similar when they're done with our Official Live Performances. MGK roared through \"more than life\" with his pal glaive, and yes, they destroyed. More coming: stay close.\n\nWatch the official video of \"more than life\": https://youtu.be/BokDch3_g-Y\nWatch music videos by Machine Gun Kelly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUs8sGiP4avNaYNVO22INhQ\n\n\nMachine Gun Kelly \nhttps://tiktok.com/@machinegunkelly\nhttp://twitter.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://instagram.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://facebook.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://machinegunkelly.com\n\nVevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\n\nDirector: Kyle Goldberg\nDirector of Photography: Skyler Brown\nSenior Line Producer: Jen Bates\nLine Producer: Maddy Schmidt\nProducer: Averi Smith\nProducer, Contrast Films: Haley Sliger\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nArt Director: Daniel Erb\n1st AD: Evan Coniglio\nProduction Coordinator: Cole Emery\n2nd AD: Aris Ray\n\n1st AC: Adam Marquez\n1st AC: Ben Steen\n2nd AC: Melissa Kirchho\n2nd AC: Keith Hudson\nJib/Crane Op: Christian Hurley\nCrane Tech: Harrison Reilly\nCrane Tech: Lucas Reilly\nDIT: Benjamin Crump\nProduction Assistant: Jordan Dominguez\nProduction Assistant: Mario Arita\nProduction Assistant: Dilllon Weidler\nProduction Assistant: Johnny Baez\nProduction Assistant: Matt Callahan\n\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nOn Set Dresser: Eric Moore\nOn Set Dresser: Tim Miller\n\nLighting Designer: Josh Beard\nKey Grip: Julien Janigo\nBest Boy Grip: Darrin Stuckwisch\n\nVFX Supervisor: Sydney Emery\nVFX: Austin Prahl\nMotion Design: Sydney Emery\nMotion Design: Jakub Blank\nDesign: Nick Resnicow\nPhotography: Brandon Bowen\nAudio: Casey Graham\n\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nColor: Company 3\nColorist: Joseph Bicknell\nPost Production Supervisor: Michael Colman\nProject Manager, Post Production: Dominic Siri\nMusic + Talent: Gabriela Prisciandaro + David McTiernan\n\n#MachineGunKelly  #morethanlife  #mainstreamsellout  \n\n\nMusic video by Machine Gun Kelly performing more than life (Official Live Performance). © 2022 Bad Boy/Interscope Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/Qd8oi8","title":"Machine Gun Kelly - more than life ft. glaive (Official Live Performance) | Vevo","duration":211,"channel_id":"UC2a9zmrdjvLsrRgi4G4blWw","author":"MGKVEVO","date":"20220720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs20GWAJVCE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bs20GWAJVCE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1558611}}

{"description":"This Video breaks youtube! How you might ask? Well the 2022 youtube algorithm is a unique creature with many fun exploits and algorithm glitches that allow us to manipulate it for extreme results. One such manipulation is watchtime! This is a great way for youtube to see if a video is clickbait or so interesting people watch it for longer potentially even replaying parts of it! So when a video has comparatively high watch time in comparison to other videos then the youtube algorithm loves to push it! \n\nSo today the spiffing brit exploits youtube with the 0.5x playback speed exploit that will double the amount of watch time the video gets. So watch as the youtube algorithm explained leads to some perfectly balanced results!  After all youtube seo is not needed when you ask how to grow on youtube with this completely unusable meta youtube algorithm hack!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.
