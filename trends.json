{"description":"Out of the sea, wish I could be... part of that world.\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton,” “Snowpiercer”) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca,” “Room”) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      \n\n“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton,” “In the Heights”), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”), who won two Oscars® for the music in the animated version of “The Little Mermaid,” with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (“Mary Poppins Returns,” “Into the Woods”). Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics are by Howard Ashman and new lyrics are by Lin-Manuel Miranda.","title":"The Little Mermaid - Official Teaser Trailer","duration":83,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20220909","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-wPm99PF9U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0-wPm99PF9U/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":7133169}}

{"description":"The magical teaser trailer for the all-new live-action musical comedy “Disenchanted,” which premiered at the D23 Expo 2022 in the Anaheim Convention Center moments ago, is here! The eagerly-anticipated sequel to “Enchanted,” which reunites original cast members Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel, and James Marsden and also stars Maya Rudolph, Gabriella Baldacchino, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Jayma Mays, is directed by Adam Shankman and features new songs from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. “Disenchanted” begins streaming November 24, exclusively on Disney+…just in time to brighten up the holiday season.\n \n\nIt has been 15 years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) wed, but Giselle has grown disillusioned with life in the city, so they move their growing family to the sleepy suburban community of Monroeville in search of a more fairy tale life. Unfortunately, it isn’t the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn’t been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family’s future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.\n\n\n“Disenchanted stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Gabriella Baldacchino, with Idina Menzel and James Marsden. Directed by Adam Shankman from a screenplay by Brigitte Hales and a story by J. David Stem & David N. Weiss and Richard LaGravenese, “Disenchanted” is produced by Barry Josephson, Barry Sonnenfeld, and Amy Adams, with Jo Burn, Sunil Perkash, and Adam Shankman serving as executive producers. The movie features songs with music by 8-time Oscar®-winning composer Alan Menken and lyrics by three-time Oscar-winning lyricist Stephen Schwartz, whose work on “Enchanted” garnered three Academy Award® nominations and a score by Alan Menken.\n\n\nDisney’s “Disenchanted” begins streaming November 24, 2022, only on Disney+.","title":"Disenchanted | Official Trailer | Disney+","duration":124,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20220909","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRuwjZJ-DQw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dRuwjZJ-DQw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4529003}}

{"description":"This Halloween Season, some legends never die. Hocus Pocus 2, an Original movie event, streaming September 30 on Disney Plus.\n\nBette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy reunite for the highly anticipated Disney+ Original Movie “Hocus Pocus 2.” The live-action, long awaited sequel to the perennial Halloween classic, which brings back the delightfully wicked Sanderson sisters for more comedic mayhem, will debut on Disney+ on September 30.\n\nIt’s been 29 years since someone lit the Black Flame Candle and resurrected the 17th-century sisters, and they are looking for revenge. Now it is up to three high-school students to stop the ravenous witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on Salem before dawn on All Hallow’s Eve. “Hocus Pocus 2” also stars Doug Jones (“The Shape of Water”), Whitney Peak (“Gossip Girl”), Lilia Buckingham (“Dirt”), Belisa Escobedo (“American Horror Stories”), Hannah Waddingham (“Ted Lasso”), Tony Hale (“Veep”), Sam Richardson (“The Tomorrow War,” “Good Boys”), Juju Brener (“Vanquish”), Froy Gutierrez (“Teen Wolf”), Taylor Paige Henderson and Nina Kitchen. The film is directed by Anne Fletcher (“Dumplin,’” “The Proposal”), written by Jen D’Angelo (“Happy Together,” “Workaholics”) and produced by Lynn Harris (“King Richard,” “The Shallows”), with Adam Shankman (“Disenchanted,” “Hairspray”), Ralph Winter (“Hocus Pocus,” “X-Men” franchise) and David Kirschner (“Hocus Pocus,” “Chucky”) serving as executive producers.","title":"Hocus Pocus 2 | Official Trailer | Disney+","duration":117,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20220909","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idc0EOmKr30","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/idc0EOmKr30/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2332668}}

{"description":"Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nShe became Queen in 1952 at the age of 25 and spent 70 years on the throne. She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \"it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \"rock\".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign.","title":"Queen Elizabeth II dies aged 96","duration":1369,"channel_id":"UCTrQ7HXWRRxr7OsOtodr2_w","author":"Channel 4 News","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYGByWrjyFw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mYGByWrjyFw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4543442}}

{"description":"In memoriam Queen Elizabeth II\n\n[This documentary was originally released in April 2022]\n\nOn February 6, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 70th anniversary on the throne. No other head of state has been in power for so long. This film analyzes the fascinating relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers.\n\nWinston Churchill was in love with his young queen. The relationship with Margaret Thatcher was difficult. Then there’s Brexiteer Boris Johnson - this film illuminates the very different relationships Queen Elizabeth has had with the many prime ministers who have served during her long reign. \n\nFilmmakers Katharina Wolff and Larissa Klinker examine Queen Elizabeth II’s role as the symbol of a centuries-old power structure in the United Kingdom. Although the British monarch has no direct political power, the prime minister travels from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace every week for a private audience. \n\nIn this film, personal secretaries, political experts and Buckingham Palace insiders reveal what is discussed at these private meetings and how much impact personalities have on the relationship between royalty and the government.\n\nUsing archival footage and personal accounts, the film shows how the queen accompanied her prime ministers through their time in office. On September 6, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Liz Truss as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #QueenElizabeth \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

{"description":"Bobby Carter | September 8, 2022\nEverything JID does is intricately detailed. He seems to care much more than the average emcee, and throughout this entire production, I felt his strong desire to get it right. The weight was lifted from his shoulders at the midway point of the set as he turned to his band, saying, \"We're pretty hot guys. We're pretty f***ing hot.\" In this performance, recorded weeks before the release of his now widely praised third studio album, The Forever Story, the East Atlanta native performs songs from the album live for the first time, plus career-defining songs in ways we've never heard before.\n\nThe origin of JID makes up the puzzle pieces in The Forever Story. It's the story of a kid with derailed football dreams, searching for purpose until it found him. These are tales that many kids from the inner city can relate to — but what sets JID's story apart is that nobody raps like him. His music casts a wide net, considering history, family and hometown, and connecting with hip-hop enthusiasts and music nerds alike.\n\nIn these stripped-down versions of songs like \"Never\" and \"Surround Sound,\" the focus is on how JID can manipulate pitch, bend words and hop from one cadence to another. After he playfully cuts the \"Usher tension,\" he and his stacked band and backup singers close with the powerful and spiritual \"Kody Blu 31.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Galaxy\"\n\"Workin Out\"\n\"Off da Zoinkys\"\n\"Never\"\n\"Sistanem\"\n\"Surround Sound\"\n\"Kody Blu 31\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJID: vocals\nNajinga Luster: vocals\nRashida Chitunda: vocals\nTeja Lanier Veal: bass\nGrady Housworth: trombone\nAllan Knighton: saxophone\nMichael Cruse: trumpet\nSamuel Williams: keys\nDivante Davis: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Alanté Serene\nAudio Assistant: Andie Huether\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #JID","title":"JID: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1323,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsaZRcL-OTQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gsaZRcL-OTQ/hqdefault.webp?v=63191459","content":{"View count":766255}}

Flynne is smart, ambitious, and doomed.  She has no future. Until the future comes calling for her. The Peripheral is master storyteller William Gibson’s dazzling, hallucinatory glimpse into the fate of mankind — and what lies beyond.  \n\nFlynne Fisher lives in the rural American South, working at the local 3D printing shop, while earning much needed extra money playing VR games for rich people.  One night she dons a headset and finds herself in futuristic London—a sleek and mysterious world, alluringly different from her own hardscrabble existence.  \nBut this isn’t like any game she’s ever played before:  Flynne begins to realize it isn’t virtual reality… it’s real.  Someone in London, seventy years in the future, has found a way to open a door to Flynne’s world.  And as utterly beguiling as London is… it’s also dangerous.  As Flynne searches to discover who has connected their worlds, and for what purpose, her presence here sets dangerous forces into motion…forces intent on destroying Flynne and her family in her own world.","title":"The Peripheral Season 1 - Teaser Trailer | Prime Video","duration":110,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSaWHbCSmRI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RSaWHbCSmRI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4298592}}

{"description":"A beautifully crafted story of forbidden love and changing social conventions, My Policeman follows three young people - policeman Tom (Harry Styles), teacher Marion (Emma Corrin) and museum curator Patrick (David Dawson) as they embark on an emotional journey in 1950s Britain. Flashing forward to the 1990s, Tom (Linus Roache), Marion (Gina McKee) and Patrick (Rupert Everett) are still reeling with longing and regret, but now they have one last chance to repair the damage of the past. Based on the book by Bethan Roberts, director Michael Grandage carves a visually transporting, heart-stopping portrait of three people caught up in the shifting tides of history, liberty, and forgiveness.\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

{"description":"(Sept. 4, 2022) Top lightweight contender Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz (24-2-1, 17 KOs) delivered a highlight-reel knockout over veteran contender Eduardo Ramirez (27-3-3, 12 KOs) in the second round of their showdown.\n \nAlready a fan-favorite after giving three-division world champion Gervonta Davis all he could handle in defeat at this same arena last December, Mexico City’s Cruz entered the ring to roaring approval as he looked for another statement victory.\n \n\"I was ready to win at all costs, for my family and what better way to win than here in front of all the great fans in Los Angeles,” said Cruz.”\n \nMidway through round two, Davis showed the fight-changing power that he possesses and that has helped make him a fan favorite in Los Angeles and beyond. Cruz first connected flush with a big left hook around a Ramirez jab that sent Ramirez to the mat hard.\n \nWhile Ramirez was able to get to his feet, Cruz pushed forward, sensing his moment to end the fight. Using a feint right hand, Ramirez caught Cruz cleanly with another left hook and followed up with a powerful right hand to score a second knockdown. This time referee Jack Reiss jumped in immediately and halt the bout 2:27 into the round.\n \n\"I lost and I have to accept that,” said Ramirez. “I'll get better and move forward. I felt like I was fighting well and then everything turned all of a sudden. That's just boxing. Now I'm going to rest, recover and plan my next moves going forward. But I'll definitely be back, you can count on that.\"\n\n#IsaacCruz #EduardoRamirez #CruzRamirez \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Cruz vs Ramirez FIGHT HIGHLIGHTS: September 4, 2022 | PBC on FOX PPV","duration":120,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20220905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7naL2FFdg2Y","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7naL2FFdg2Y/hqdefault.jpg?v=6315aca0","content":{"View count":1075519}}
