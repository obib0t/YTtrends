{"description":"Check out the new trailer, plus a poster and new image for Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Wish,” which opens exclusively in theaters on Nov. 22. The trailer introduces 17-year-old Asha, the powerful King Magnifico, Asha’s pet goat Valentino, and Star, a celestial ball of boundless energy that Asha’s wish calls down from the sky. It also features a snippet of the song “This Wish,” performed by Ariana DeBose; it’s one of several new songs written by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice for the film.\n \nThe all-new musical-comedy welcomes audiences to Rosas, a fantastical land located off the Iberian Peninsula. “Our heroine, Asha, lives in Rosas, known as the kingdom of wishes,” said director Chris Buck, who helms the film with Fawn Veerasunthorn. “People come from everywhere to give their wishes to a magical king who promises to grant their deepest desires—someday. Only he can decide which wishes will come true and when.” \n \nAdded Veerasunthorn, “We have been inspired by so many iconic films over Disney Animation’s 100 years, especially stories where we explore the power of someone with a wish, combined with the conviction to make that wish come true. Being able to honor that legacy with this incredible story and these amazing characters has been a joy for our entire team.”\n \nABOUT THE MOVIE\nIn “Wish,” Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe—the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico—to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Featuring the voices of Academy Award®-winning actor Ariana DeBose as Asha, Chris Pine as Magnifico, and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino, the film is helmed by Oscar®-winning director Chris Buck (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), produced by Peter Del Vecho (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and co-produced by Juan Pablo Reyes (“Encanto”). Jennifer Lee (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) executive produces—Lee and Allison Moore (“Night Sky,” “Manhunt”) are writers on the project. With original songs by Grammy®-nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer/songwriter/musician Benjamin Rice, plus score by composer Dave Metzger, “Wish” opens only in theaters on Nov. 22, 2023. \n \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneywishmovie/ / https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\nHashtag: #WishMovie","title":"Disney's Wish | Official Teaser Trailer","duration":110,"channel_id":"UC_976xMxPgzIa290Hqtk-9g","author":"Walt Disney Animation Studios","date":"20230427","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctlz0R1tSZE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ctlz0R1tSZE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4186316}}

{"description":"What does healthy parenting look like? How do parents show up without being overbearing or controlling?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are taking a look at Pixar parents and ranking them by healthy parenting throughout the films. They rank Coco’s Mama Imelda, Inside Out’s Jill and Bill, Luca’s Daniela and Lorenzo, Onward’s Laurel, and Turning Red’s Ming and Jin. Jonathan uses his expertise in family therapy to explain why some Pixar parents miss the mark and why some excel at parenting their children. Some parents react instead of respond, some are overbearing, and others make room for all emotions to be felt.

{"description":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.\n\n\"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes what Fallen Order did and wall-runs with it, then double-jumps and air-dashes straight into an epic lightsaber battle. Rather than taking us back to square one to begin Cal’s journey as a Padawan again, we’re trusted with control of a full-fledged Jedi Knight who we can grow into a master of superhuman mobility and fantastic and challenging combat. With a new set of larger, more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast of returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable at times but is still fun and emotional to watch play out. Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game. If Respawn makes one more like this it’ll be the best Star Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down.\"","title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review","duration":862,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230426","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMPzks0pq0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndMPzks0pq0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1434563}}

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! It's time for my annual bath - and for such an occasion, we decided to travel to most famous geothermal spa in Iceland - the Blue Lagoon. I've been wanting to unleash an international spa travel series for a long time - so here is my formal declaration: it's spa time, baby! \n\nSo this past January, as the first installment of a 3-part Nordic/Scandinavian travel trip, we journeyed to the beautiful, mineral-rich light blue waters of the Blue Lagoon - to soak, smoothie, and face mask, oh my. Will this magical lagoon keep my skin plump and youthful forever? Or will the lava rock exfoliate my face right off? Who knows! \n\nQuick note - we mentioned that the Reykjanes lava field was 800 years old - I think it's actually much, much older than that - but the earliest recorded eruption was about 800 years ago (which is where our fact came from)!\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nMelissa Douglas\nPhil Kinney\nBree von Bradsky\nElizabeth Pinotti\nAndrew Lainhart\nIshara Mathews\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n1:58 Flying to Iceland\n3:27 A Jet-lagged Day in Reykjavík\n5:46 The Blue Lagoon Retreat Hotel\n7:46 Prepping for the Blue Lagoon\n9:30 Dipping into the Blue Lagoon\n10:51 What is The Blue Lagoon, anyway?\n13:25 The Waterfall\n14:46 The Smoothie Bar\n16:12 The Face Mask Bar\n18:44 Underwater Massages\n19:58 Other Crevices of the Blue Lagoon\n20:39 Steam Room and Dry Sauna\n21:35 The Silica Hotel\n22:26 The Silica Lagoon\n25:52 Outro","title":"I Went To An Icelandic Geothermal Spa","duration":1695,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230423","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyBe3b1sS8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/3hyBe3b1sS8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1520197}}

Go to our sponsor https://betterhelp.com/tylertodd for 10% off your first month of therapy or https://pridecounseling.com/tylerandtodd\n\nThe idea to build a shipping container home was definitely one of the wildest ones we've had and if you've been joining our weekly videos for any amount of time you know that's saying something. It feels absolutely incredible that the container home FINALLY has a consistent and reliable source of heat...just in time for the holidays! Join us every Sunday as we continue to create off the grid homestead vlogs, sharing our adventures as we build our own alternative lifestyle of living off the land and building a home out of shipping containers \n\nJoin us on Patreon where we have over 30 never before seen episodes AND 37 recorded livestreams...hours and hours of entertainment to binge watch!\nhttps://bit.ly/TylerandTodd-Patreon\n\nInstagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd\n\nEnjoying the music? Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01BIM5USYLM1W","title":"The Shipping Container Home has TRANSFORMED!","duration":1576,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20230423","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq_-Uehe7aw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Kq_-Uehe7aw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":191939}}

{"description":"Starship gave us quite a show during today’s first flight test of a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy rocket from Starbase in Texas. \n \nAt 8:33 a.m. CT, Starship successfully lifted off from the orbital launch pad for the first time. The vehicle cleared the pad and beach as Starship climbed to an apogee of ~39 km over the Gulf of Mexico – the highest of any Starship to-date. The vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble. The flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship. As is standard procedure, the pad and surrounding area was cleared well in advance of the test, and we expect the road and beach near the pad to remain closed until tomorrow.\n\nWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship.\n \nThank you to our customers, Cameron County, and the wider community for the continued support and encouragement. And congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting first flight test of Starship!","title":"Starship Flight Test","duration":3200,"channel_id":"UCtI0Hodo5o5dUb67FeUjDeA","author":"SpaceX","date":"20230420","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1wcilQ58hI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-1wcilQ58hI/hqdefault.jpg?v=643dc70a","content":{"View count":11593573}}

I don’t have a huge budget or label behind me and really rely on word of mouth to get this song out there - so please like / share / follow / subscribe - SPAM people with it!!!! If you can afford to buy it on iTunes - that really hugely helps independent artists especially in terms of charting!!! And most importantly, listen, dance, and scream it at the top of your lungs. Love and appreciate you all.
