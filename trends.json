{"description":"Long Live the Fighters. #DunePartTwo only in theaters November 3.\n\n-----------------\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dune\nhttps://twitter.com/dunemovie \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@dunemovie \n-----------------\nThe saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast.  The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).\n“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. \nVilleneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel.  The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick.  The executive producers are Josh Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.\nVilleneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West.  Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.\n“Dune: Part Two” was filmed on location in Budapest, Abu Dhabi, Jordan and Italy.  The film is slated for a November 3, 2023 worldwide release from Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Dune: Part Two | Official Trailer","duration":144,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

Then finally I recycled old slag to see if it would produce any more iron.\n\nThe first way was to roast the ore before smelting. This drove off the moisture and volatiles in the ore as well as burning off any sulfur present. The resulting ore produced a higher yield of iron than normal (33g iron as opposed to about 15g iron as usual for the same volume of ore, charcoal and time). \n\nNext lime was added to the smelt as a flux in the form of snail shells. The theory was that the lime would lower the melting point of any silica in the ore to make a runnier slag and help the iron come together more. The result was very bad, no iron was produced apart from 1 or 2 prills. I suspect the ore is already basic in chemistry and adding a basic flux in the form of lime made it so basic that the slag was too viscous. The ore probably won't benefit from a basic flux but might benefit from an acid flux such as sand or slag from previous smelts.\n\nNext I tried smelting slag from previous smelts to see if anymore iron would come out. It did surprisingly, less than fresh ore but still worth doing. For this reason it might be useful to add old slag as a flux to future smelts to help the slag form more easily, while contributing some more iron to the smelt.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials.

I got distracted by Grian not finding the backside of the base and ended up in Docm77s base and things went really bad after finding his tunnel-boring redstone machine and accidentally blowing it up. The TNT was unforgiving. Grian and I tried our best to fix it and give him a gift. I can't believe this happened!!  See you in the next episode when we tell Doc we broke his tunnel bore machine. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n*Subscribe to my clips channel \"GoodClipsWithScar\"  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrmsyulCK0py5o94jcJTsFg\n\n*Subscribe to my VODS channel \"GoodVodsWithScar\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_lYxBSVZ4JzsULD4BVm9A\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nMy Links and stuff:\n* Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=21298347\n* Twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/GTWScar\n* Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/goodtimeswithscar\n* Instagram: http://instagram.com/goodtimeswithscar\n*TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@goodtokswithscar\n*Business Inquiries Send to: gtws@pbnj.gg\n---------------------------------------------------------\nHermitcraft SMP - season 9 info and seed coming soon.\n\nFor more information and links to all things Hermitcraft, follow the link to the Hermitcraft website: https://hermitcraft.com/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Hermitcraft9 #HermitcraftSeason9 #GoodTimesWithScar","title":"Hermitcraft 9 Ep 37:  I DID A BAD THING...","duration":1411,"channel_id":"UCodkNmk9oWRTIYZdr_HuSlg","author":"GoodTimesWithScar","date":"20230503","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqewbwaUfQU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EqewbwaUfQU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":416894}}

{"description":"The 2023 MET Gala has come and gone, and well I wish it had gone rather faster, considering the lack of care or interest most of the celebrities put into it. The MET Gala exhibit “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” was celebrated with a red carpet attended by the world of celebrity and fashion’s elite. But the theme of the red carpet “In honor of Karl” was certainly followed loosely. Celebrities arrived wearing poor imitations of Karl Lagerfeld’s work at Chanel, while neglecting his work at Fendi, Patou, Balmain, and Chloé so severely it was almost sickening. What was supposed to be an exciting and easy theme to follow, was obviously just too hard. \n\nMET Gala 2023 Karl Lagerfeld Theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrFvY8KczIM\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:09 Anna Wintour & Bill Nighy - Chanel\n2:25 Anne Hathaway - Versace\n3:49 Bad Bunny - Jacquemus\n5:13 Billie Eilish - Simone Rocha\n6:55 Cardi B - Chen Peng\n8:26 Doja Cat - Oscar de la Renta\n10:36 Dua Lipa - Chanel\n12:42 Emma Chamberlain - Miu Miu\n14:03 Gigi Hadid - Givenchy\n15:10 Ice Spice - Balmain \n17:00 Janelle Monae - Thom Browne\n18:49 Jared Leto\n18:55 Jenna Ortega - Thom Browne\n20:43 Jennie Kim - Chanel\n22:34 Kendall Jenner - Marc Jacobs\n23:39 Kim Kardashian - Schiaparelli\n25:13 Kylie Jenner - Jean Paul Gaultier by Haider Ackermann\n26:13 Lil Nas X - Pat McGrath\n27:45 Lizzo - Chanel\n28:51 Margot Robbie - Chanel\n29:50 Michaela Coel - Schiaparelli\n32:02 Nicole Kidman - Chanel\n33:16 Rihanna & A$AP Rocky\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join\n\nSocial Media:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/\nPersonal Style: https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hautelemode\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess\n\nFor business inquiries please contact: hautelemode@whalartalent.com\n\nVideo Edited by:\nRachel Fritz: https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/","title":"THE MET GALA SUCKED (2023 Met Gala Fashion Roast)","duration":2178,"channel_id":"UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw","author":"HauteLeMode","date":"20230502","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WcvAiKQfI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E_WcvAiKQfI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGFkgWShZMA8=&rs=AOn4CLD4Q_jyaXlbRY4lRYssznm-KXWxbg","content":{"View count":547041}}

{"description":"The Met Gala 2023 was fashion's biggest night, and it brought out the best in celebrities. In this OSSA'm video, we'll be exploring all of the Met Gala’s 2023 must-see looks and biggest moments!\n\nIn today's OSSA'm video, you will learn that this year's theme was \"\"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\"\" and celebrities paid homage to the legendary designer. Most celebrities followed Karl's dress code, wearing black and white gowns. Florence Pugh, Olivia Rodrigo, and Jenna Ortega perfectly combined these colors. Celebrities also had fun imitating Karl's favorite cat, Choupette. Jared Leto even brought a giant copy of the cat's head with him. Doja Cat and Lil Nas X took their cat look further. Lil Nas X covered his body with nothing but a thong and a silver tint, while Doja Cat completed her Oscar de la Renta hooded gown with cat ears on the hood. Rihanna made a bold statement, arriving covered with iconic Chanel camellia flowers from head to toe. Cardi B also wore a stunning white dress but later changed to a pink gown that didn't match the dress code of the event. There were also examples of chic and elegance at the event, with Pedro Pascal and Pete Davidson paying tribute to Chanel in their looks. Kim Kardashian arrived at the Met Gala dripping in precious gems, wearing a dress made from 50,000 pearls and 16,000 crystals. Her ex-boyfriend, Pete Davidson, posed on the red carpet alone this time, but they reunited inside for a sweet talk. Meanwhile, Serena Williams announced her second pregnancy at the event.\n\nOverall, the Met Gala 2023 was a night of surprises, and it showcased some of the most memorable fashion moments in recent history.

Imagine your playing civ 5 against nuclear ghandi except ghandi is a necromancer summoning the undead with the power to transform the land into an active volcano. Today The Spiffing Brit is playing the game to see if age of wonders 4 is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits! Although spoilers he finds 4 exploits in the game and will be covering all of them for you today. From farming pantheon points, unlimited gold and free trade deals to just printing units by instantly transferring provinces. \n\nYou can check out AOW 4 here: https://play.ageofwonders.com/SpiffingBrit\n\nThis video is going to be packed with funny clips in a montage style of british humor!

{"description":"GRAB THE LIMITED GN15 ANNIVERSARY FOIL SHIRT! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/limited-edition-foil-gn15-tshirt-design | Grab one of the brand new, LIMITED EDITION FOIL 'GN15' shirts to help out while getting something commemorative for 15 years of GamersNexus in return! This research piece took us a straight week of nonstop work to complete. We're beyond excited to have worked on this -- it's exactly what we love doing here. \n\nThis video benchmarks and tests various points of failure for the AMD X3D CPUs in particular, but also just generally AM5 / Ryzen 7000 (Zen 4) CPU failures. The most eye-catching failure mode is catastrophic: Users have posted photos of exploded CPUs with blown-out motherboard sockets and melted plastic. We bought those parts from the users to perform a failure analysis, then set forth testing our own AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPUs to see if we could make them explode. Spoiler alert: It worked. We were able to melt new AMD X3D CPUs in the socket of an ASUS X670E Crosshair Hero motherboard, but we also found severe BIOS bugs in Gigabyte's BIOS. SOC voltage isn't the only concern, here. It's also poor OCP implementation on at least the ASUS board we used, plus a combination of the erosion of thermal and over-current protections. As stated in the video, no test of this type is fully conclusive: These are complex issues with functionally infinite variables between users (and possible error), manufacturers, BIOS versions, and AMD itself. As such, we can only speak to our findings in some instances -- but we have some that do point to specific issues.\n\nWe killed 2x 7800X3Ds and 1x ASUS motherboard, but we also had 2 failed CPUs and 1 failed board from viewers.\n\nWe will have at least 1 more part following this video up. We've sent parts out to the same failure analysis lab we worked with in our NVIDIA 12VHPWR content - it'll take a few weeks to put together.\n\nBig thanks to Wendell at @Level1Techs - check out his channel!\nThanks to @der8auer for his guidance on delidding safely!\nCheck out Elmor's super cool utilities: https://elmorlabs.com/\n\r\nWatch our last failure analysis video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig2px7ofKhQ\n\nLike our content?
