{"description":"A day in the life at a Japanese Bakery in Tokyo Japan. This is the working life of a typical Japanese baker and their Japan work culture.  We follow the Japan baker during their work hours as well as the morning routine and after work life.  Japanese bakeries are known for their unique variety of bread products quite different to their western counterparts, with items such as melon pan, an pan and all kinds of sozai breads. And although rice is a Japanese staple, bread gained in popularity during the meiji period, and in less than 2 centuries, it’s become even more popular than rice.  Soft Japanese bread with all sorts of cream and curry fillings, mentaiko and yakisoba toppings is all perfectly suited for the local taste.  In Japan, food safety is paramount to showcasing and serving delectable breads.  And with Japanese customers equally conscious about cleanliness, it's almost culturally mandatory for breads to be individually wrapped assuring customers that each piece of bread has been properly handled and no else has touched it. Shokupan is a Japanese milk bread, popular for its milky-sweet taste, undeniable moistness and pillowy cottoncandy like softness often served as breakfast toast or sandwich bread.  Different than traditional white bread, it has a richer flavorful experience. The Yudane baking method which originated in Japan is used here.  Instead of being cooked, the flour is mixed with boiled water then left to cool down before use, which gelatinizes the starch in the flour resulting in a more tender bread which stays softer for longer. \n\nAripan Bakery\nLocation - https://goo.gl/maps/occ511AarD1xnb7y8\nIG - @arina_de_panaderia, @arinasuda67\n- https://instagram.com/arina_de_panaderia\n- https://instagram.com/arinasuda67\n\nWatch more of my Japan Day in the Life videos:\n- https://tokyozebra.com/ditl\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n___ Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ___\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?

With his livelihood threatened, Snow is reluctantly assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from the impoverished District 12. But after Lucy Gray’s charm captivates the audience of Panem, Snow sees an opportunity to shift their fates. With everything he has worked for hanging in the balance, Snow unites with Lucy Gray to turn the odds in their favor. Battling his instincts for both good and evil, Snow sets out on a race against time to survive and reveal if he will ultimately become a songbird or a snake.","title":"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023) Official Trailer","duration":169,"channel_id":"UCjvqqA-Eogozfm244OhUESw","author":"The Hunger Games","date":"20230427","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BwB3SBPOg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f9BwB3SBPOg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1228405}}

{"description":"Check out the new trailer, plus a poster and new image for Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Wish,” which opens exclusively in theaters on Nov. 22. The trailer introduces 17-year-old Asha, the powerful King Magnifico, Asha’s pet goat Valentino, and Star, a celestial ball of boundless energy that Asha’s wish calls down from the sky. It also features a snippet of the song “This Wish,” performed by Ariana DeBose; it’s one of several new songs written by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice for the film.\n \nThe all-new musical-comedy welcomes audiences to Rosas, a fantastical land located off the Iberian Peninsula. “Our heroine, Asha, lives in Rosas, known as the kingdom of wishes,” said director Chris Buck, who helms the film with Fawn Veerasunthorn. “People come from everywhere to give their wishes to a magical king who promises to grant their deepest desires—someday. Only he can decide which wishes will come true and when.” \n \nAdded Veerasunthorn, “We have been inspired by so many iconic films over Disney Animation’s 100 years, especially stories where we explore the power of someone with a wish, combined with the conviction to make that wish come true. Being able to honor that legacy with this incredible story and these amazing characters has been a joy for our entire team.”\n \nABOUT THE MOVIE\nIn “Wish,” Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe—the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico—to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Featuring the voices of Academy Award®-winning actor Ariana DeBose as Asha, Chris Pine as Magnifico, and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino, the film is helmed by Oscar®-winning director Chris Buck (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), produced by Peter Del Vecho (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and co-produced by Juan Pablo Reyes (“Encanto”). Jennifer Lee (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) executive produces—Lee and Allison Moore (“Night Sky,” “Manhunt”) are writers on the project. With original songs by Grammy®-nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer/songwriter/musician Benjamin Rice, plus score by composer Dave Metzger, “Wish” opens only in theaters on Nov. 22, 2023. \n \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneywishmovie/ / https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\nHashtag: #WishMovie","title":"Disney's Wish | Official Teaser Trailer","duration":110,"channel_id":"UC_976xMxPgzIa290Hqtk-9g","author":"Walt Disney Animation Studios","date":"20230427","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctlz0R1tSZE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ctlz0R1tSZE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4610095}}

Wise words and questionable training methods from Mark will hopefully give Cameron the edge he needs as he continues his journey from STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order™.\nThe story of Cal, Merrin, Greez, and Cere continues in STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor, an epic new adventure that will push Cal further than ever as he fights to protect the ones he loves against a galaxy descending into darkness at the height of the Empire’s power.\n\nPicking up five years after the events of STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order, STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor is a third person, narrative-driven action-adventure game from Respawn Entertainment, developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor will be available on PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S and Windows PC.","title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor - Jedi Coaching Sessions Trailer","duration":66,"channel_id":"UCOsVSkmXD1tc6uiJ2hc0wYQ","author":"EA Star Wars","date":"20230427","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz1swnk0dgA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Sz1swnk0dgA/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1834864}}

The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.\n\nFollow Disney+ for the latest: \nDisney+: https://www.disneyplus.com/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/DisneyPlus/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/DisneyPlus/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyPlus/ \n\nSubscribe to DisneyMusicVEVO 🔔 for all the latest Disney music videos: https://www.youtube.com/@DisneyMusicVEVO?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Disney Music: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic\n\nMusic video by Halle performing Part of Your World (From \"The Little Mermaid\"/Visualizer Video). © 2023 Walt Disney Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/6w78ID","title":"Halle - Part of Your World (From \"The Little Mermaid\"/Visualizer Video)","duration":215,"channel_id":"UCgwv23FVv3lqh567yagXfNg","author":"DisneyMusicVEVO","date":"20230426","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu-RcFv50Sc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cu-RcFv50Sc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1766360}}

{"description":"Watch worlds collide in trailer 2 for The Flash - Only in Theaters June 16. #TheFlashMovie \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n“The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).\n\n“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023.","title":"The Flash - Official Trailer 2","duration":171,"channel_id":"UCiifkYAs_bq1pt_zbNAzYGg","author":"DC","date":"20230425","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r51cYVZWKdY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r51cYVZWKdY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":28053019}}

{"description":"What does healthy parenting look like? How do parents show up without being overbearing or controlling?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are taking a look at Pixar parents and ranking them by healthy parenting throughout the films. They rank Coco’s Mama Imelda, Inside Out’s Jill and Bill, Luca’s Daniela and Lorenzo, Onward’s Laurel, and Turning Red’s Ming and Jin. Jonathan uses his expertise in family therapy to explain why some Pixar parents miss the mark and why some excel at parenting their children. Some parents react instead of respond, some are overbearing, and others make room for all emotions to be felt. Jonathan and Alan share some of their parenting wins and misses, and they compliment each other’s dadding.\n\nJoin our Patreon: https://patreon.com/CinemaTherapy\n\nTry our popcorn: ctpopcorn.com\n\nCinema Therapy is:\nWritten by: Megan Seawright, Jonathan Decker, and Alan Seawright\nProduced by: Jonathan Decker, Megan Seawright, Alan Seawright, and Corinne Demyanovich\nEdited by: David Sant\nDirector of Photography: Bradley Olsen\nEnglish Transcription by: Anna Preis","title":"Family Therapist Ranks PIXAR Parents","duration":1886,"channel_id":"UCCYX4s1DCn51Hpf1peHS30Q","author":"Cinema Therapy","date":"20230425","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pfcKfQkA8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/T7pfcKfQkA8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":890143}}

{"description":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.\n\n\"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes what Fallen Order did and wall-runs with it, then double-jumps and air-dashes straight into an epic lightsaber battle. Rather than taking us back to square one to begin Cal’s journey as a Padawan again, we’re trusted with control of a full-fledged Jedi Knight who we can grow into a master of superhuman mobility and fantastic and challenging combat. With a new set of larger, more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast of returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable at times but is still fun and emotional to watch play out. Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game. If Respawn makes one more like this it’ll be the best Star Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down.\"","title":"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review","duration":862,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230426","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMPzks0pq0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndMPzks0pq0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1709654}}
