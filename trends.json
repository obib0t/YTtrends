{"description":"Halloween Ends\n10.14.22\nhttps://www.halloweenmovie.com/\n\nThis is Laurie Strode’s last stand. \n\nAfter 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive. \n\nIcon Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the last time as Laurie Strode, horror’s first “final girl” and the role that launched Curtis’ career. Curtis has portrayed Laurie for more than four decades now, one of the longest actor-character pairings in cinema history. When the franchise relaunched in 2018, Halloween shattered box office records, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing chapter and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a horror film starring a woman. \n\nFour years after the events of last year’s Halloween Kills, Laurie is living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and is finishing writing her memoir. Michael Myers hasn’t been seen since. Laurie, after allowing the specter of Michael to determine and drive her reality for decades, has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell; The Hardy Boys, Virgin River), is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can’t control, once and for all. \n\nHalloween Ends co-stars returning cast Will Patton as Officer Frank Hawkins, Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and James Jude Courtney as The Shape.  \n\nFrom the creative team that relaunched the franchise with 2018’s Halloween and Halloween Kills, the film is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Paul Brad Logan (Manglehorn), Chris Bernier (The Driver series), Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Halloween Ends is produced by Malek Akkad, Jason Blum and Bill Block. The executive producers are John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Ryan Freimann, Ryan Turek, Andrew Golov, Thom Zadra and Christopher H. Warner. \n\nUniversal Pictures, Miramax and Blumhouse present a Malek Akkad production, in association with Rough House Pictures. \n\nFacebook:","title":"Halloween Ends - Official Trailer","duration":76,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20220720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mAWKyfj6c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/i_mAWKyfj6c/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1863211}}

{"description":"Julian Alvarez, Stefan Ortega Moreno and Kalvin Phillips played their first game as Manchester City players as we returned to action with victory over Club America in the opening match of our pre-season tour of the United States.\n\nErling Haaland was an unused substitute as Kevin De Bruyne’s brace gave Pep Guardiola’s side a 2-1 win over the Mexican outfit at Houston’s NRG Stadium.\n\nThe Belgian opened the scoring with a trademark finish on the half hour mark, riding two challenges on a burst forward and curling a wonderful 18-yard effort into the far corner.\n\nClub America levelled against the run of play 13 minutes later as striker Henry Martin latched onto a lofted ball over the top and checked inside Nathan Ake before squeezing the ball between Ortega Moreno’s legs.\n\nDe Bruyne sealed the win on the stroke of half-time, ghosting in behind the opposition defence to collect Riyad Mahrez’s perfectly weighted through ball and firing underneath Oscar Jimenez.\n\nSUBSCRIBE! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mancity\n\nhttp://www.mancity.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/mancity\nhttp://www.twitter.com/mancity\nhttp://www.instagram.com/mancity\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mancity\n\nAbout the Official Man City YouTube Channel:\n\nHere you will find all the latest videos from Manchester City, including, all Premier League goals, highlights, behind-the-scenes footage, training and much more.\n\nGet closer to the likes of Jack Grealish, Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling, Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden and the rest of Pep Guardiola's team.","title":"HIGHLIGHTS!

On the inside you will be greeted by the return of red carpet, highly bolstered performance seats and an aluminum shift knob. Under the hood is an updated 2.0L inline-4 turbocharged engine mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox only.

{"description":"This Video breaks youtube! How you might ask? Well the 2022 youtube algorithm is a unique creature with many fun exploits and algorithm glitches that allow us to manipulate it for extreme results. One such manipulation is watchtime! This is a great way for youtube to see if a video is clickbait or so interesting people watch it for longer potentially even replaying parts of it! So when a video has comparatively high watch time in comparison to other videos then the youtube algorithm loves to push it! \n\nSo today the spiffing brit exploits youtube with the 0.5x playback speed exploit that will double the amount of watch time the video gets. So watch as the youtube algorithm explained leads to some perfectly balanced results!  After all youtube seo is not needed when you ask how to grow on youtube with this completely unusable meta youtube algorithm hack!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. If you enjoyed this why not watch our community post exploit detailing how to get more views or our steam sale exploit cheesing the summer sale! \n\n00:00 - You Must Watch in 0.5x Speed\n00:12 - What Is Going On\n00:22 - The Exploit\n00:36 - The Youtube Algorithm\n00:50 - New Youtube Meta?\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\ntitle: This Video Breaks Youtube.\n\n#youtube #glitch #video","title":"This Video Breaks Youtube.","duration":72,"channel_id":"UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ","author":"The Spiffing Brit","date":"20220720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyguvcHwE3s","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TyguvcHwE3s/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1698942}}

{"description":"When adjusted for inflation, wages have remained virtually unchanged over the last 50 years, with workers today earning just 12 cents more than they did in 1972. And with inflation at its highest since 1971, Americans are feeling the pain of slow wage growth. Two-thirds of American workers said that inflation has outpaced any salary gains made in the past year. But some economists argue that the concept is merely a myth politicians use to promote their careers. So, how real is wage stagnation in America today and what does it mean for American workers?

{"description":"Better Call Saul Season 6 Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained. In-depth recap and review of “Fun and Games”. Please subscribe! 👉 http://bit.ly/PetePeppers\n\nIn the ninth episode of Better Call Saul's final season, we wrapped up the story of Jimmy McGill in the prequel's timeline. In the end, Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) made a decision to leave because even though she loves Jimmy (Bob Odenkirk), she contends that they are like poison when they are together. \n\nIn episode 9 after the breakup, the show jumps ahead in time to the Breaking Bad timeline. We see that Jimmy has completely transformed into Saul Goodman with Kim out of his life.  \n\nEpisode 609: “Fun and Games”\nDirected by Michael Morris\nWritten by Ann Cherkis\nOriginal Air Date July 18, 2022\nOfficial Synopsis: Gus attempts to smooth things over with the cartel while Mike ties up loose ends.\n\nHeralded as “a beautiful tragedy and gripping character drama” (IndieWire) and “one of the best dramas on television” (Vulture), Saul’s 13-episode final season will roll out in two parts with the first seven episodes beginning April 18 and culminating with the series’ final six episodes beginning July 11. \n\nBetter Call Saul’s final season concludes the complicated journey and transformation of its compromised hero, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), into criminal lawyer Saul Goodman. From the cartel to the courthouse, from Albuquerque to Omaha, season six tracks Jimmy, Saul and Gene as well as Jimmy’s complex relationship with Kim (Rhea Seehorn), who is in the midst of her own existential crisis. Meanwhile, Mike (Jonathan Banks), Gus (Giancarlo Esposito), Nacho (Michael Mando) and Lalo (Tony Dalton) are locked into a game of cat and mouse with mortal stakes.\n\nIf you want to leave me a tip for my work 💰 https://paypal.me/petepeppersYT\n\nWhat are your favorite BCS theories for the upcoming season 6?

Jimmy becomes the lawyer for former beat cop Mike Ehrmantraut,  whose relevant skill set allows him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

If the sloshes get too far apart, we call it a drought.

{"description":"Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 | The Bloody Lie (2022)\n\nThe promise was a health care revolution. The reality was a bloody lie. When Elizabeth Holmes claimed she'd invented a device that with a pinprick of blood could diagnose hundreds of medical conditions, she became the darling of Silicon Valley. Holmes, along with her business partner and ex-lover Sunny Balwani, then set about duping investors to bankroll their multi-billion dollar company, Theranos.

{"description":"Cameron Smith put together one of the great rounds in major history to become Champion Golfer of the Year at The 150th Open.\n\nThe Australian started the final day four strokes back from Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland but shot an incredible 64, which featured five birdies in a row at the beginning of the back nine and another on 18, to overhaul McIlroy and fend off Cameron Young by a stroke.\n\nHis finishing score of 20-under-par matched Henrik Stenson’s winning number from Royal Troon six years ago and is the joint-best score to par in Open history, and the lowest at St Andrews.\n\nSmith is also the first Australian to become Champion Golfer since Greg Norman in 1993 and in the process shot the lowest fourth round by a champion in St Andrews history, surpassing Zach Johnson’s 66 in 2015.\n\nSmith was three shots back from McIlroy at the beginning of the back nine but he switched his putter on when it mattered most, holing putts from five, 16, 11, 18 and five feet to swing the Championship his way.\n\nVisit www.TheOpen.com for the greatest stories in golf\n\nKeep in touch with us!\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/The-Open-Championship/ \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/TheOpen \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/theopen/\nTo LICENSE The Open footage, please contact IMG REPLAY   ▶ https://bit.ly/306V7dI","title":"Cameron Smith wins The 150th Open Championship | Final Round Highlights","duration":653,"channel_id":"UCZ5fOnOmQunH18xZGhu9f_Q","author":"The Open","date":"20220717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz-TB7qprhg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cz-TB7qprhg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":865056}}

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #travel #travelvlog #tuscany #tuscanytrail \n\n00:00 Recap Tuscany Trail Day 1, 2, and 3\n00:57 Day 4 - the one that broke Kara\n04:18 Kara joins the support crew\n12:32 Day 5 - the one with the castle\n27:23 Group outdoor shower 😂\n31:15 Day 6 - the one with the broken bikes\n38:32 Day 7 - the one with the crash","title":"She didn't make it...","duration":2589,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220716","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWPM2y8qEJc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jWPM2y8qEJc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1151292}}

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.

{"description":"solving cases with violence\n\n▶Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/itspaikon\n▶Discord: https://discord.gg/Et9Nct8M7P\n▶Twitter: https://twitter.com/itspaikon\n▶TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@itspaikon\n▶Clips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9MPcpeWS0SYO6WvzRFm8xw\n\nsmol Aloy edit artist: https://twitter.com/miaowcomics\n\nMore About Genshin Impact:\nPlayers can explore the game's large fantasy world, called Teyvat, with over 25+ characters and various points of interest spread across the map. The game features an action combat playstyle that allows the player to swap between 4 individual characters in a party to quickly combo attacks. Single-player gameplay is the focus of the game, with Co-Op Mode available for certain activities.\n\nEach character has two unique combat skills: a normal skill and a special skill. The normal skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, while the special skill has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy first.\n\nCharacters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro, and Geo. Cooking is another significant aspect of Genshin Impact's gameplay. Players gather many resources in the course of their adventure, some of which can be turned into dishes via cooking. Some dishes regenerate characters' health, while others boost attack or defensive abilities.\n\n#genshinimpact #gaming","title":"I Smashed the Universe Into Pieces with 4 Heizous | Genshin Impact","duration":960,"channel_id":"UCZzxTLnsGMD-ZDH9o5MatGw","author":"itspaikon","date":"20220716","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0HQ5RhE0ek","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0HQ5RhE0ek/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":529202}}
