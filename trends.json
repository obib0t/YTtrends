{"description":"92 %ers, and probably a lot of you entering your ‚Äúfootball era‚Äù, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Accelerator Active Energy! \n\nIn this episode, we break down the Eagles' dominant win on Monday Night Football, how much better this Eagles D-line might be than last year and the right time to go for the hurdle. \n\nWe also recap the most talked about 30-point win in the history of the NFL, the Chiefs' big win against the Bears. We‚Äôll get to why the Chiefs offense is finally clicking, Big Red‚Äôs career milestone, and we finally talk about it, Taylor Swift paid a visit to the Chiefs Kingdom. \n\nAlso, we answer some not-dumb football questions from the Swifties, try and figure out just how the Dolphins dropped 70 on the Broncos, and let you know if we would have kicked the record-breaking field goal. \n\nThis Friday we will be dropping our incredible episode with The Chiefs Chris ‚ÄúStone Cold‚Äù Jones! The guys talk about everything from his new contract, his wardrobe malfunction at the combines, what he likes least about offensive linemen, and why he wants to get lined up against Tyreek Hill. \n\nMake sure you‚Äôre subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don‚Äôt miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nACCELERATOR ACTIVE ENERGY: Available nationwide at Target or visit https://ashoc.com/ to find the store nearest you.  \n\nSTATE FARM: https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/multiline or talk to a State Farm agent today to learn how you can bundle and save with the Personal Price Plan.

{"description":"Walkers, \n\nEarlier this year, @Vikkstar123 and I decided to go to the studio together ‚Äì we started on a new version of the 90s hit \"Better Off Alone\" by @alicedj Little did I know what awaited me when we decided to release this track just a few weeks ago.\n\nIn recent weeks, we've not only worked on giving a new life into this iconic melody but also had the opportunity to collaborate with the original producers of \"Better Off Alone,\" Seb & Eelke, who are also the masterminds behind theTrance project @dashberlin They've introduced us to their new frontman, Ryan, and together, we've recorded the track, filmed a music video, and had some fantastic days of planning and promotion in Oslo. Along the way, I've even been hunted by a crazy cat smurf who seemed to be following me around, but now we're finally ready to share the song and music video with all of you.\n\nYou all know how much I value collaboration and the magic that happens when people come together to make music and share experiences. Being a part of this journey has been an absolute honor. I've learned a lot from the legends behind Dash Berlin and watched Vikk as he released his first official song.I want to say a big thank you for being a part of my journey.

The Three-Way Knockouts are also back. This time, however, artists will select their own songs to perform.\n\nOnce the Live Performance Shows begin, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast. This time, the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists. In the end, one artist will be named \"The Voice\" and receive the grand prize of a recording contract.\n \nThirteen-Year-Old with Unbelievable Talent Sings \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" | The Voice | NBC\nhttps://youtu.be/YbJlO02oqvg\n\nThe Voice\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","title":"Thirteen-Year-Old with Unbelievable Talent Sings \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" | The Voice | NBC","duration":286,"channel_id":"UCpdK1NLHxEUGXc1gq2NxkTw","author":"The Voice","date":"20230927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbJlO02oqvg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YbJlO02oqvg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1041906}}

The Three-Way Knockouts are also back. This time, however, artists will select their own songs to perform.\n\nOnce the Live Performance Shows begin, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast. This time, the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists. In the end, one artist will be named \"The Voice\" and receive the grand prize of a recording contract.\n \nCoaches Fight Over Mara Justine's \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" by Elton John | Voice Blind Auditions\nhttps://youtu.be/thX1ex70kKk\n\nThe Voice\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","title":"Coaches Fight Over Mara Justine's \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" by Elton John | Voice Blind Auditions","duration":481,"channel_id":"UCpdK1NLHxEUGXc1gq2NxkTw","author":"The Voice","date":"20230926","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thX1ex70kKk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/thX1ex70kKk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1158853}}

{"description":"It's November 11, 2011. Todd Howard has just unleashed Skyrim into the world. No patches. Release build. Take his word for it: it just works. Join me today as I play through the original release of Skyrim, but every time I encounter a glitch, bug or exploit.. my health is reduced by 5. It's going to be quite a journey...  \n\nA HUGE THANK YOU TO Nighthawk and the Team at Skyblivion for helping duct tape together a working copy of the release build of skyrim for me! And No I cannot legally distribute it to you sorry...\n\nAs Bethesda have just released starfield that has been a relatively bug free game excluding all of the exploits I felt it was important to go back in time and see if we can compare the release build of skyrim to a starfield review of sorts. Now as Todd Howard would never lie and every one of his games have the it just works seal of gameplay approval it is impossible for us to have a non perfectly balanced experience! So begone Skyrim Anniversary edition because we are going to the original! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n\nChapters\n00:00 - Skyrim Release Build\n01:05 - Back Again!\n03:32 - Meet Nord Nordinson\n04:36 - The Glitches Begin\n08:10 - Our Journey Finally Begins‚Ä¶\n13:14 - Out into the world!\n19:24 - Faendal no!\n21:55 - Off to Whiterun‚Ä¶\n24:37 - Let‚Äôs Fight a Dragon!\n28:57 - Thanks, Todd\n33:55 - Meet Skyrim - 480p mode\n36:42 - Horse Shenanigans\n39:57 - My Great Folly (which is Todd‚Äôs Fault)\n41:11 - BIG FINISH\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: Can I Beat Skyrim's Release Build?

{"description":"We‚Äôve wanted to plant an orchard on our homestead for YEARS to grow our own food‚Ä¶today is finally the day! Go to our sponsor https://betterhelp.com/tylertodd for 10% off your first month of therapy! \n\nThe idea to build a shipping container home was definitely one of the wildest ones we've had and if you've been joining our weekly videos for any amount of time you know that's saying something. Without question, it's a project that is much more difficult than we thought it would be but we're having fun along the way and that's what counts. Join us every Sunday as we continue to create off the grid homestead vlogs, sharing our adventures as we build our own alternative lifestyle of living off the land and building a home out of shipping containers!\n\nJoin us on Patreon where we have over 30 never before seen episodes AND 50+ videos...hours and hours of entertainment to binge watch!\nhttps://bit.ly/TylerandTodd-Patreon\n\nInstagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd\n\nEnjoying the music? Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we‚Äôve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMusicbed SyncID: \nMB01Q7KG9GU69QL","title":"I Built an Orchard","duration":1231,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20230924","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99zFtmFezoY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/99zFtmFezoY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":119648}}

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.
