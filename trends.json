That’s why I built Ryan Trahan the worlds largest penny to celebrate the completion of Ryan’s penny series which culminated with him delivering a penny to MrBeast.

{"description":"Twenty years ago, a series of tragic events almost ripped the blue-collar town of Millwood apart. Now, in present day, a disparate group of teen girls — a brand-new set of Little Liars — find themselves tormented by an unknown Assailant and made to pay for the secret sin committed by their parents two decades ago...as well as their own. In the dark, coming-of-age, horror-tinged drama Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin, we find ourselves miles away from Rosewood, but within the existing Pretty Little Liars universe — in a brand-new town, with a new generation of Little Liars. \n\nStreaming July 28 on HBOMax.\n\nAbout HBO Max:\nHBO Max is WarnerBrosDiscovery’s direct-to-consumer offering with 10,000 hours of curated premium content.

Instead, the drill can plunge directly into the earth’s surface. From there, horizontal directional drilling is pretty straightforward, but it’s not necessarily straight.

{"description":"Superliminal is a game based on forced perspective and optical illusions. This makes for one of the coolest speedruns, that may also break your mind\n\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\nWatch live at: https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nWatch the world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/vnL-jTGIUaE\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nSuperliminal description (from Steam):\n\nABOUT THIS GAME\nSuperliminal is a first-person puzzle game based on forced perspective and optical illusions. Puzzles in this game give you a sense of the unexpected. Players need to change their perspective and think outside the box to wake up from the dream.\n\nWAKE UP\nAs you fall asleep with the TV on at 3AM, you remember catching a glimpse of the commercial for Dr. Pierce’s Somnasculpt dream therapy program. By the time you open your eyes, you’re already dreaming - beginning the first stages of this experimental program.\n\nPERCEPTION IS REALITY\nExplore a dream world where everything is exactly as it seems. Tread carefully as the world slowly unravels around you and subverts your expectations. What you see isn’t always precisely what you get.\n\nMAN VS MACHINE\nIn this fully-voiced adventure, Dr Glenn Pierce is doing his questionable best to guide you home and out of the dreamscape. His artificial intelligence assistant, however, is having trouble understanding exactly how you’re here at all, and has other plans for you.\n\nDEVELOPER COMMENTARY\nWe’ve added an extensive developer commentary throughout the game, so you can learn the secrets and history behind the game’s development.\n\nCHALLENGE MODE\nThe overwhelming response from the speedrunning community to Superliminal inspired us to add a new Challenge Mode, which will score you per-level on metrics such as time to finish, grabs, and jumps.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP SUPPORT\nSuperliminal features Steam Workshop integration. Bring any 3D object into the game and play around with mind-bending perspective tricks.\n\n#EazySpeezy #Superliminal #Speedrun","title":"Superliminal speedruns might break your mind","duration":1237,"channel_id":"UCQSEAbOs6vsJfy7WN7iYaGQ","author":"EazySpeezy","date":"20220704","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wwn0AaF3tM4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Wwn0AaF3tM4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":560291}}

{"description":"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nBobby Carter | June 30, 2022\n\"We celebrate Black Music Month. This has been Black magic.\" Truer words may have never been spoken behind the Tiny Desk as R&B goliath Usher caps off our month-long celebration of Black music, highlighting a catalog chock-full of hits spanning 25 years. It's been over two years since NPR headquarters was abuzz with chatter of a legend in the building. After an early morning rehearsal for his set at the Something in the Water Festival in Washington, D.C., he made his way over to deliver an unforgettable performance.\n\nUsher and his band, all dipped in black, set it off with an introduction over a funky horn-laced instrumental reminiscent of a Blaxploitation flick. They keep that groove going right into a reworked version of his 1997 breakout single, \"You Make Me Wanna...\" Twenty-five years later, Usher sits arguably as the king of R&B. Between 2000 and 2010, there was no debate whatsoever, with his string of records that included the biggest R&B album of the 21st century, Confessions.\n\nWhat he's done in the vocal booth is only half of his claim to fame. The stage is where he's continued to shine as he prepares for the second leg of his Las Vegas residency. This loose and playful set touches on his many career phases; the crooning, the deeply personal, the club bangers and even the Tik Tok challenges indicate that he could just be reaching his prime. Recently, we've heard plenty of hot takes, wild battles and social media fodder about who sits at the mountaintop in the world of R&B. Usher Raymond has entered the chat.\n\nSET LIST\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\"\n\"Superstar\"\n\"U Don't Have to Call\"\n\"Nice & Slow\"\n\"Confessions Part II\"\n\"My Way\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nUsher: vocals\nEric Bellinger: vocals\nVedo: vocals\nDmitry Gorodetsky: bass\nLemar Guillary: trombone\nBrandyn Phillips: trumpet\nJay Flat: saxophone\nDarek Cobbs: keys\nErick Walls: guitar\nRyan Carr: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Kara Frame\nEditor: Michael Zamora\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, Alanté Serene\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #usher #BMM","title":"Usher: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1487,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220630","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8ODGFWgFg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/up8ODGFWgFg/hqdefault.jpg?v=62bcc32c","content":{"View count":4896795}}

The focus is on freedom, driving, exploration and immersion. It has minimal car maintenance and survival elements.\n\nInfinite Desert, Freedom and Driving:\nThere are no invisible walls or unable to jump over small fences, or blinking red \"wrong direction\" signs on the hud. The car won't need 10-20 liter fuel over just only a few hundred meters, with a full tank, you could go approximately 500 kilometers. If you see a distant big mountain, you can go there and if you are capable, you can climb it. If you don't like where the mirrors are facing you can adjust them however you want or throw them away while driving at full speed. If you want to lean out of the car, or closer to the radio or near anything, you can.","title":"I Turned a Fun Road Trip Into a Nightmare Voyage - The Long Drive","duration":1129,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220701","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88RAHxrQ33M","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/88RAHxrQ33M/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2077359}}

{"description":"As of July 2022, I’m no longer working with Diamondback Bicycles. As I stated in the video the details of the matter are private. However, I can tell you that the split was 100% amicable. My time working with Diamondback was very fruitful, and their bikes have held up to an incredible amount of abuse here on Berm Peak and beyond. \n\nSince 2017, Diamondback Bicycles had been this channels bike sponsor. It’s common for YouTubers to have a bike sponsor now. Many creators are only able to go full time with the help of one or more sponsors, as was my case back in 2017. At that time, my arrangement with Diamondback wasn’t so common in the YouTube world, as I wasn’t a professional or competing in any capacity. This seemed pretty unthinkable at the time, but it turned out to be not so crazy. \n\nWe had some great years, Diamondback!

The ore was a species of bacteria that lives by oxidizing iron dissolved in ground water. It appears as an orange/yellow cloudy precipitate in creeks and ponds. It's a very common natural occurrence and can be found on all continents. I collected the diluted ore and poured it into a large, porous ceramic pot I made. The water leaked out, leaving behind the concentrated iron bacteria \"mud\" like substance. I dried it out until it resembled rusty earth. It took a month to collect the ore for one 2 hour smelt, from a stretch of creek about 20 meters long. \n\nCharcoal was then made simply by burning a pile of wood in a small pit and then extinguishing it with just enough water once it had visibly carbonized. It was quicker to make than the charcoal I normally make in a mound (1hr vs 2.5hrs) and took less preparation time making than the mound from mud. A small furnace was made and the multiblade blower (made in the last episode) was attached to it for air supply. \n\nThe furnace was preheated for an hour with wood and filled with charcoal at the end, using the blower periodically but not full blast. Then over the next hour, 3 double handfuls of charcoal (about 500g) and 2 single handfuls or ore (about 200g) were added every 5 minutes while blowing air into the furnace to burn it at this rate. Then there was a 30 min burn down still using the blower till the charcoal reached the level of the air entry. The total operation took 2 hrs. A lump of slag was taken from the furnace and broken up. Iron prills up to about 1 cm in diameter were retrieved. For the sake of experiment I weighed the iron produced on modern scales= 40g iron from an estimated 1.2 kg of ore. Even though this is a low yield by modern standards it is a marked improvement over my previous smelts that produced much smaller and fewer prills over all. I did another smelt that almost exactly reproduced this result (80g of iron stored). The increase in efficiency is due to the much better blower design (8 blades vs the original 4). \n\nNext I cast the iron in a mold. The melting point of pure metalic iron is 1538 C. However, the iron prills I produced are cast iron, an alloy of iron and carbon where carbon is about 2-4% by weight. Cast iron has a relatively tepid melting point of 1150 C. Such a temperature is easily attainable in an open hearth with charcoal and a forced air supply. So, I put the prills into a triangular clay mold and put it into a simple pit forge that took very little time to make. Importantly, I made a special flat air pipe that spread the incoming air into a sheet that blew over the width of the mold to heat all of it evenly, a round one would only heat the middle of the mold and not melt it completely. Charcoal was then put on top of the mold about 12.5 cm deep and the air blast started. The fire became white hot, exceeding the 1150 C needed to melt the iron. The iron melted filling the mold and the iron triangle was taken from it. \n\nInitially, I was going to make it into an axe head, but decided it was too brittle (cast iron is actually harder than pure iron but brittle) so I sharpened it into a knife. It took many hours of sharpening to bring the end to a point. It's not a sharp blade it works well for drilling holes in timber (like for making fire drill sockets). This represents the first iron tool I've made completely from scratch in the wild.
