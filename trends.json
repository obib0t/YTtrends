{"description":"Watch and you'll see, some day I'll be, part of your world! Watch the new trailer for #TheLittleMermaid and see the movie in theaters May 26!\n\nThe brand new soundtrack for Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” is available now to Pre-Save, Pre-Add or Pre-Order – https://presave.umusic.com/thelittlemermaidsoundtrack\n\n“The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) as the voice of Sebastian; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca”) as the voice of Flounder; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      \n \n“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”) with a screenplay by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”). The songs feature music from multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”) and lyrics by Howard Ashman, and new lyrics by three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), Miranda, two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), and Rob Marshall, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. \n\nHashtag: #TheLittleMermaid\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/littlemermaid\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyTheLittleMermaid\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneylittlemermaid/","title":"The Little Mermaid | Official Trailer","duration":141,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpGo2_d3oYE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kpGo2_d3oYE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":6183103}}

{"description":"Governments are rushing to reassure citizens that their money is safe, after the US saw its biggest banking collapse since the global financial crisis. Silicon Valley Bank's demise was closely followed by that of New York-based Signature Bank. The US insists a repeat of 2008 is not on the cards - but how contagious could the problems be?\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg released a joint statement Sunday that they will complete the resolution of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) whilst protecting depositors.\n\n\"Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThe reason authorities believe the taxpayer will incur no cost is that authorities administrating the bank will be able to use its remaining assets to cover the costs of reimbursing depositors.\n\nThe same will also apply to Signature Bank. On Sunday, the New York State Chartering Authority closed down the cryptocurrency-exposed lender that had lost around a third of its share price value in the second half of the week. \n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters on Sunday that he would speak at more length on the issue early on Monday.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#US #bankfailure #USregulators","title":"As another bank collapses, US regulators race to prevent spread of crisis I DW News","duration":475,"channel_id":"UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg","author":"DW News","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0Ilm230bf8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a0Ilm230bf8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":889630}}

First up though I wanna thank everyone for rocking with me the last 9 weeks and we're sort of like Joel and Ellie a bit because I'd doom the entire human race just to get a thumbs up from you.\n\nAnyway we start off the episode with a flashback and this features a major game cameo. Out in the woods we join a pregnant woman running and this is none other than Ashley Johnson. Ashley voiced Ellie in the game and here we catch her playing her mother. So far several big actors from the game have popped up including Tommy's voice actor as Perry, Troy Baker as James last week and Marlene's who shows up later on in this scene.\n\nEllies mother is called Anna and she was first mentioned in the last of us comic American Dreams.\n\nThis featured Ellie and Riley and in it we learned a little bit about Anna and what she did before the outbreak.\n\nAnna worked as a nurse before the outbreak and we know that she and her lifelong friend Marlene survived together when everything went down worse than this channels views next week.\n\nAll that we learned from the backstroy was that she died within a day of giving birth to Ellie but here we see it fleshed out with her running to a farmhouse being chased by an infected person. We can see a big symbol for the fireflies denoting that this is a safehouse and you can also catch what I'm guessing is the Boston QZ in the background. As we know this was controlled by Fedra and though we don't learn why Anna's out on her own like this it likely has something to do with the infected.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":3025,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2-Egs56y_I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2-Egs56y_I/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":296902}}

{"description":"PRESS START. The final #SuperMarioMovie trailer is here! Tickets on sale now: https://uni.pictures/SMBGetTickets\n--\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\nOnly In Theaters April 5, 2023\n\nFacebook: https://uni.pictures/SMBFB\nTwitter: https://uni.pictures/SMBTW\nInstagram: https://uni.pictures/SMBIG\nTikTok: https://uni.pictures/SMBTT\nSite: https://uni.pictures/SMBSite\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/illuminationent\nhttps://www.facebook.com/illuminationent\nhttps://twitter.com/illumination\n--\n\nFor the first time, the iconic global entertainment brands Illumination and Nintendo join forces to create The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a new, big-screen adventure starring one of pop culture’s most prominent plumbers of the past four decades.\n\nBased on the world of Nintendo’s Mario games, the film invites audiences into a vibrant, thrilling new universe unlike any created before in an action-packed, exuberant cinematic comedy event. \n\nWhile working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt; Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi. \n\nWith the assistance of a Mushroom Kingdom resident Toad (Keegan-Michael Key; The Lion King) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy;The Queen’s Gambit), Mario taps into his own power. \n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an extraordinary comedic cast, including Jack Black (Jumanji films) as Bowser, Seth Rogen (Neighbors franchise) as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen (Portlandia, Saturday Night Live) as Cranky Kong, Kevin Michael Richardson (American Dad!, Family Guy) as Kamek and Sebastian Maniscalco (Green Book) as Spike, plus a special voice appearance by Charles Martinet, who has voiced the characters of Mario and Luigi in the Super Mario games for more than 30 years.\n\nThe film is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (collaborators on Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part). \n\nFrom Nintendo and Illumination—creator of the global blockbuster Despicable Me, Minions, Sing and The Secret Life of Pets franchises—The Super Mario Bros. Movie is produced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri p.g.a. and by Nintendo’s Representative Director and Fellow Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario, after more than six years of close bond and discussions between the two. The film is co-financed by Universal Pictures and Nintendo and will be released worldwide by Universal Pictures.","title":"The Super Mario Bros.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone.

He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #TearItDown #Recovery","title":"Quando Rondo - Tear It Down [Official Music Video]","duration":198,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20230309","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRWPouGltM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2QRWPouGltM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":699781}}

{"description":"As they walk through the mines, Mando picks up a dusty Mandalorian helmet, when he’s captured by a large cyborg with a general grievous looking organic eye. Super cool concept whoever came up with this and then got it approved did a great job. I loved this, had some old revenge of the sith concept art vibes. He moves like Grievous, and is literally just a brain with one eye, the rest is mecahnical. Whatever this creature is, he has some very high end cybernetics, akin to Grievous’s.\n\nGrogu tries to free mando with the force but fails and so Din tells Baby Yoda to go get Bo Katan. Now some people in the live stream chat were wondering why he didn’t say go get Boba Fett, but I would say because there’s less explanation needed with Bo Katan and the fact that Bo knows Mandalore well. \nAs Baby Yoda grabs her attention by landing, they head in her ship, the Gauntlet Starfighter.\nLanding back on Mandalore, she tells Grogu it didn’t always look like this you know, as they land down and go find Mando, heading deep into the mines. Taking her helmet off as she stares at what has become of Mandalore. She says this once was a beautiful city, and that her family laid claim to it all…now it’s just a tomb. She’s quite aware of her surroundings as she pushes Grogu aside and blasts down some Allamites. We see how proficient she is as a fighter and mandalorian as she makes quick work of them without the dark saber at her side.\n\n\nHeading into the general grievous 2.0’s lair where mando is being held, she fights him and then summons the dark saber as she ignites it and moves so smooth and swiftly around unlike Din Djarin who wields it like it’s Thor’s heavy hammer and he’s unworthy as heck.\nBo beats the creature twice, once in his grievous form, and then again in his mecha warrior suit. The Dark saber is rumored to be more powerful than a lightsaber blade, but who knows for sure in canon.\n\n She seems inspired or perhaps has a nefarious plan behind this but tells Din she’ll take him to the springs he seeks for atonement. Grogu pfffts which tells me he doesn’t trust Bo, he can probably feel her nefarious feelings perhaps.\n\nShe says the empire set out to punish them to wipe away their memory of their glorious planet. Bo says what’s painful is not that the empire destroyed them, but rather the civil wars they endured for centuries, leading to the weakness for the Empire to break them.\nBo admits as a child she went to the springs to play but as her royal family would have her do, she would publicly recite the mandalorian tenets infront of large crowds. Mandalorian people loved to see their princess do so. The Mandalorian tenets, also known as the Resol'nare, are a set of core principles that define what it means to be a Mandalorian. The six tenets include: wearing armor, speaking the language of Mandoa, defending oneself and family, raising children as Mandalorians, contributing to the clan's welfare, and answering the call to action from the Mandalore.\n\nMando tells her he wishes to have met her father, and that he died defending mandalore. Mando pauses and says this is the way. She realizes how patriotic Mando is, and she seems to like it. I think there’s a bit of a chemistry here perhaps, but a love hate relationship perhaps.\n\nThey arrive at the living waters, and it’s a dark dungy looking place now. She reads the plaque and it states that this is the place of the great mythosaur, that mandalore the great was able to tame the mythical beast. It is said that if a mandalorian rides a mythosaur, they control all mandalore and mandalorians. I think it even goes beyond the authority of the dark saber. Personally, I think Mandalore the great is just the new canon version of mandalore the ultimate. Mandalore the Great was an ancient Mandalorian ruler who led the Mandalorians in a series of conflicts against the Jedi Order.\nAs Din walks into the water and recites his vow as a mandalorian and the creed, Bo looks on in admiration of his loyalty and passion for Mandalorians. She seems like she really respects it, as he recites and walks further, he drops like a sack of bricks in the water all the way to the bottom surface where Bo grabs him and as she blasts back up to the surface with Mando, she passes a GIANT creature, a mythosaur thought to be extinct!\n\nSo the Mythosaur still exists. This means rule over Mandalore is still possible if one is to tame the creature, which is exactly what I think Bo Katan will do. She may tame the beast, use it to defeat Din and take the dark saber for herself. \n\nA funny theory is if Grogu uses beast control to tame the beast, making him the leader of Mandalore, or perhaps Din if he tells the Mythosaur to answer to him.\n\n\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/realswtheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Episode 2 S3 BREAKDOWN - IT EXISTS!!","duration":888,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20230308","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUi5dyWfWnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cUi5dyWfWnE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":372946}}

{"description":"The 2023 Lotus Emira First Edition ($94,430 USD as spec’d, $120,688 CAD) is a brand new sports car with two engine choices. A torquey AMG 4 cylinder mated to a 6 speed auto, or a supercharged 3.5L V6 with a manual option. Both options come with strong horsepower numbers at 359 hp and 400 hp respectively, but the smaller 4 cylinder actually has a bit more torque. James has secretly used the company credit card to put a deposit down on a new Emira, and Thomas is learning that they will either have to take delivery, or forfeit their deposit altogether. Will the new Lotus Emira be everything they hope it will be? We hope you enjoy the episode.

In this video, we continue our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support this potentially history-altering theory.\n\nMY SOCIALS:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/miniminuteman/\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@miniminuteman\nE-Mail (Business inquiries only.

{"description":"A 22-year-old construction manager served as one of the 12 jurors who found Alex Murdaugh guilty of murdering his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, after deliberating for less than three hours. James, who asked that his last name be withheld, spoke to the Law&Crime Network's Angenette Levy about the kennel video, how prayer played a role in the trial, whether Alex Murdaugh's testimony mattered, and more.\n\nNOTE: James' brother is a Colleton County sheriff's deputy who responded to Moselle the night of the murders but was not involved in the investigation. James said both the state and the defense were aware of his brother's employment and approved of him being on the jury.\n\nFollow Angenette Levy: https://twitter.com/Angenette5\n\n#AlexMurdaugh #MurdaughMurders #LawAndCrime \n\nSTAY UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LAW&CRIME NETWORK:\nWatch Law&Crime Network on YouTubeTV: https://bit.ly/3td2e3y\nWhere To Watch Law&Crime Network: https://bit.ly/3akxLK5\nSign Up For Law&Crime's Daily Newsletter: https://bit.ly/LawandCrimeNewsletter\nRead Fascinating Articles From Law&Crime Network: https://bit.ly/3td2Iqo\n\nLAW&CRIME NETWORK SOCIAL MEDIA:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lawandcrime/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LawCrimeNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lawandcrime\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/lawandcrimenetwork\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@lawandcrime\n\nLAW&CRIME NETWORK PODCASTS: https://lawandcrime.com/podcasts/\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ALL OF LAW&CRIME NETWORK YOUTUBE CHANNELS:\nMain Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz8K1occVvDTYDfFo7N5EZw\nLaw&Crime Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVXOqoOCYbi-iXChKAl6DTQ\nChannel B: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXCLaaClAWQiTkl3pw9ZdLw\nChannel C: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMV3pzWIhJGLYzoHyxBjjNw","title":"Alex Murdaugh Juror Tells All — How Jury Knew Disgraced Lawyer Killed Family","duration":2007,"channel_id":"UCz8K1occVvDTYDfFo7N5EZw","author":"Law&Crime Network","date":"20230306","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8C8xFOOsGI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/j8C8xFOOsGI/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1909159}}
