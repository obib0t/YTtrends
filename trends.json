To distract Kai for the day, we sent him to Universal Studios with an all access pass and he had a blast. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible!

This will cause all sorts of problems in Russian-held territory: it will flood the area downstream, it will limit the irrigation of agricultural fields to the south, and it might limit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's ability to cool itself. Why is Russia doing this? The straightforward answer is that it will reduce Ukraine's ability to initiate an attack in Kherson, thereby freeing up Russian soldiers to pursue an offensive in the north. But it also hints at the possibility that Russia is running low on soldiers, otherwise Moscow would not be willing to incur these costs.\n\n0:00 Does Russia Have a Manpower Shortage?\n0:48 The Draining of the Kakhovka Dam and Reservoir\n2:18 Why Would Russia Release the Dam?\n4:00 Where the Flood Goes\n5:19 Irrigation Problems\n6:54 The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Problem\n8:22 Why Russia Is Probably Running out of Soldiers\n10:04 Or Maybe Russia WAS Running out of Soldiers\n11:30 Is the Russian Winter Offensive a Failure?\n12:59 Boris Johnson's Tie\n\nThe appearance of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) visual information does not imply or constitute DoD endorsement.\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY 2.0: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/):\n\nBy IAEA:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/52339383057/in/album-72177720301779673/\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/):\n\nBy IAEA:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/8506930028\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/11083570446\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/):\n\nBy Kremlin.ru:\nhttp://kremlin.ru/news/20604\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/50329\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/57436\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/60490\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/62249\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/security-council/62933\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67061\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69390\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69465\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69737\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69743\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69756\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69800\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70159\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70315\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70341\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70414\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70565","title":"Russia Just Took a Big Dam Risk.

But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you weaker. \nSo, what happens when you get sick?\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ‚ù§ https://kgs.link/shop-174\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army üêß  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ‚ô¨‚ô™\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/3ZpId7E\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3KOh9Lj\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\nüê¶üêßüê§ PATREON BIRD ARMY üê§üêßüê¶\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nJoshua, Rigers Qeraj, Hamza S, Matthias Foss, Andy D, Tetsuro Kiyooka, Biljana, richardpoulson, Bonzai Garden, Diego Dias Ribeiro da Silva, Kaefersam, Johnny, CookieEroy, Cheesecake King, GHOST96, Patrick Zollondz, Rhys McGauran, Philipp G, Dennis Hippe, TakatukaUltra95, Niggl, Nivek, Earnur 5, Rex Vanhoff, gaetan thoraval, Christian Harshbarger, PANZER KAT, Kelley Green, Kenny Lin, JHD, Michal Hobl√≠k, Millennial Glacier, CuratorViper, James Gill, 4bstr, Fabian Maurer, Michael Willis, Jacob Ord","title":"Your Immune System is More Dangerous than You Think","duration":672,"channel_id":"UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q","author":"Kurzgesagt ‚Äì In a Nutshell","date":"20230228","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-K7mxdN62M","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M-K7mxdN62M/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1969517}}

Download the free Ground News app at https://ground.news/miniminuteman\n\nVIDEO INFO\nHowdy friends! In this video, we begin our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence for it.\n\nADDENDUM: At 48:00 I mistakenly class the Zigurrat at Ur as a burial structure. In reality, the Ziggurat was a temple to the Goddess of the moon. In research I got this crossed with the Royal Cemetary at Ur.

{"description":"Welcome to Sons Of The Forest! The much anticipated sequel to perfectly balanced survival game The Forrest. Similar to that game this one is rammed with various bugs, glitches and exploits that allow you to dupe items and break the laws of physics! Today we will be doing just that by showing one of the fastest and easiest ways to beat the game using just a stick! That's right, this entire 20+ hour game can be beaten with just a stick as sticks allow you to faze through reality. This is rather similar to an exploit in the forest that allowed you to speedrun through all of the locked keycard doors in the game! \n\nToday I will be crossing the entire survival island bypassing the keycard door into the underground lab. Skipping the 3d printing section and going straight for the endgame by sticking my way through the super special final secret door! Sure you might watch a beginer tips and tricks video telling you what to do and how to play the game. Or you could watch The Spiffing Brit explain how to break the laws of reality and bypass all of that fun sons of the forest gameplay with a good old fashion stick take that ign! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:40 - Crash Landing\n01:55 - We're off on an adventure!\n05:23 - The British Space Program\n08:25 - A Stick-y situation\n10:03 - Thinking outside the box\n11:31 - Spelunking\n14:12 - Finishing the Game\n16:36 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nDisclaimer: I am not sure who first discovered the stick glitch as I am 90% certain I am not the first to learn you can glitch the doors using sticks in both of the games. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: How I Beat SONS OF THE FOREST...

{"description":"NASCAR continued its west coast travels with the Pala Casino 400 as Ross Chastain and Kyle Busch started stage one with a fury! Busch was a strong contender to win the first stage until he suffered a pit-stop penalty which played a role into Busch finishing 12th. Chastain cruised to a comfortable first-place finish. Chastain continued this theme in the second stage where he again finished in first place, followed by Kyle Busch and Joey Logano. However, in the final stage, Busch took it to another level and was able to win the Pala Casino 400. With the victory, Busch holds the all-time record for consecutive cup seasons with a victory at 19 and is now ninth in the all-time victories list.\n\n#NASCARonFOX #NASCAR #Fontana\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫FOX Sports YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n‚ñ∫PBC ON FOX‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n‚ñ∫WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n‚ñ∫FOX Soccer‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n‚ñ∫CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOX\nLike NASCAR on FOX on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXFacebook\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXTwitter\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXInstagram\n\nAbout NASCAR on FOX:\nYour home for NASCAR on FOX, from Raceday to Radioactive and all of the racing action in between.\n\n2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX\nhttps://youtu.be/ZXJyURa1Cww\n\nNASCAR on FOX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/NASCARonFOX","title":"2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX","duration":832,"channel_id":"UCWw4HqQcexuZfeFd4XLrNNg","author":"NASCAR on FOX","date":"20230227","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJyURa1Cww","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXJyURa1Cww/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":264800}}

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling!

{"description":"Hey guys! Today I attempt to \"Fix The Unfixable\" squishies in my collection. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my \"hopeless bin\" and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!\n\nDON'T FORGET TO GET THE ME PLAYING CARDS:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/p/7422520721599\n\n*available only until March 20th*\n\n________FAQs_________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.
