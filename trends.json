{"description":"This September the legend begins. #TheRingsOfPower\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien‚Äôs pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N√∫menor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.\n\nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now? We've got it. This week's newest movies, last night's TV shows, classic favorites, and more are available to stream instantly, plus all your videos are stored in Your Video Library.

{"description":"Funny Marco welcomes Orlando Brown, an American actor, rapper and singer. He is best known for his roles as Cadet Kevin 'Tiger' Dunne in Major Payne, 3J Winslow in ‚ÄúFamily Matters,‚Äù Max in ‚ÄúTwo of a Kind,‚Äù Damey Wayne \"Waynehead\" in Waynehead, Sticky Webb in ‚ÄúThe Proud Family,‚Äù Cornelius Fillmore in ‚ÄúFillmore!,‚Äù Eddie Thomas in ‚ÄúThat's So Raven,‚Äù and Frankie in ‚ÄúEddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off.‚Äù \n \nIn this episode the antics and tension are felt immediately as the crew is late setting up and Orlando blows in the mic seeming to frustrate Marco who in turns starts interrogating Orlando about his experience working with Will Smith, which Orlando denies. Not one to take one word answers, Marco goes deep and asks Orlando about his past and if he has fumbled the bag. Orlando responds by saying he is all about love. As the interview continues Marco asks Orlando about his drip. The random questions from Marco seem to baffle and frustrate Orlando. Marco then asks the question on how Orlando feels about going from Disney to TMZ. Orlando responds that is part of the lifestyle of growing up under the spotlight. Orlando also says Marco owns the Shade Room and the Shade Room plays him. An argument starts with the crew as Orlando speaks in the camera to speak directly to The Shade Room. Marco then asks Orlando about Raven-Symone. Orlando calls Marco Raven and starts to sing the theme song to ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs So Raven.‚Äù Marco then gets into Orlando‚Äôs rap career playing one of Orlando‚Äôs songs. Marco asks about his lyrics and Orlando talks about how Debbie Allen inspired him. Marco then shows Orlando a publicity shot of Orlando at Disney next to a mugshot. Orlando points out on his mugshot that he has a tattoo of Raven on his neck. Marco then asks Orlando about Mariah Carey for which Orlando says that her real name is Danielle and he would never sleep with his buddy Nick Cannon‚Äôs girl. The antics continue as Marco asks about Orlando‚Äôs high speed chase. Orlando gives a message to 50 Cent about being down. The producer comments that Orlando has a lifetime contract with Disney. Orlando vehemently denies the claim. Orlando claims Bill Cosby owns Disney and says R Kelly is guilty and he saw the tapes. As usual chaos ensues as Orlando seems patient but confused as he eats a snack. Orlando talks about the Straight Outta Compton feature that he was cut out of. Marco asks a question about Lil Bow Wow and Orlando makes the claim that Lil Bow Wow has ‚Äúbomb ass pussy.‚Äù  \nThe crew is shocked at the comment but Marco stays professional. The crew is having problems as the sound man gets fired. Orlando starts to petition Lil Wayne‚Äôs manager Cortez Bryant, a guest in the crowd, for representation, making for an awkward moment. The random questions continue as Marco seems to be fed up.  \n \nExecutive Producers: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries IG @TheRealDaveMays @IGoByBrettJ\n \nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @MattAblesPromotions\n \nDirector of Photography: Rashid ‚ÄúCruz‚Äù Terry\n \nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco\n \nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Orlando Brown talks TMZ, Disney, Raven Simone, 50 Cent plea, DMs Mariah Carey, Lil Bow Wow + More","duration":1532,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH2yzHSliu0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YH2yzHSliu0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":524639}}

But during his remarks, the president was interrupted by Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquin was one of 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.  \n\n¬ª Subscribe to USA TODAY: http://bit.ly/1xa3XAh\n¬ª Watch more on this and other topics from USA TODAY: https://bit.ly/3uHprM5\n¬ª USA TODAY delivers current local and national news, sports, entertainment,  finance, technology, and more through award-winning journalism, photos, videos and VR.\n\n#Biden #Parkland #Shooting","title":"Biden interrupted by father of Parkland victim | USA TODAY","duration":60,"channel_id":"UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g","author":"USA TODAY","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8P75mHo7p0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/l8P75mHo7p0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":313187}}

Like the first sip of an ice cold drink on a hot summer day, the song expresses the clear and cool feeling of a cold and tangy pop. The fast mood could easily seem as light but by capturing the fast mood with Chung Ha‚Äôs strong voice, this cool and sparkle track was completed. The arpeggio of the analog synthesizer achieves harmony with the retro but trendy drumline, and by adding in the electric guitar, the chorus also realizes a tough but witty rich sound. And Chung Ha‚Äôs chameleonic changes in emotions corresponding with the lyrics can be a key point of this song. Like the lyrics, ‚ÄúYou make me sparkle‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be your sparkle‚Äù, Chung Ha‚Äôs ‚ÄòSparkling‚Äô will glitter up our summer moments. \n\n160ÎåÄÏùò Îπ†Î•∏ BPM ÏúÑÏóê ÌïòÏù¥Ìçº Î∞îÏù¥Î∏åÎ•º ÏïÑÏù¥Îç¥Ìã∞Ìã∞Î°ú, ÌÉÑÏÇ∞Ï≤òÎüº ÏãúÏõêÌïú ÏÇ¨Ïö¥ÎìúÍ∞Ä Îß§Î†•Ï†ÅÏù∏ Í≥°Ïù¥Îã§.

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! a bit of an experimental video here, but i hope you guys like it... \n\nHave you ever wondered why you always get lost in IKEA? Or why you can't leave Sephora without a hand full of lipstick swatches? Or why you just love hanging out at Target? I was curious... so I decided to do some research on how different retail stores manipulate you into spending more time at their stores, interacting with their products more, and therefore, spending more of you hard earned cash at their shops. We explored different tactics that Ikea, Target, Sephora, and Ulta use to lure customers in & keep them there until they make a purchase! This is the first of a 3-part series we're gonna be working on throughout the year!\n\nA big thank you to Jen Clinehens for helping us out with this video; make sure to check out her YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/GrowLiketheGreatest\n\nMake sure to check out The Food Theorists' video on Grocery store manipulation here!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqviBPG2uPE\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/‚Äã\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nWRITTEN by\nRachel Faulkner\nSafiya Nygaard\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDayana Espinoza\nJarvis Rooker\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nOther sources:\nRemus, Emily. ‚ÄúDisruptive Shopping: Women, Space, and Capitalism.‚Äù The American Historian, The Organization of American Historians\nSegran, Elizabeth. ‚ÄúDepartment Stores Were the Original Retail Startups.

{"description":"This is the 200th Episode of Mike Finnegan's Garage and its fire! I towed a boat trailer riding on golf cart tires 4,400 miles to go boating for just 5 days. It was worth it just to see my wife finally get to driver HER BOAT! That's right, I really did build this 21 foot long Eliminator Daytona with a twin-turbocharged Texas Speed 427ci LSX engine and Dominator jet drive for her. Sure, she didn't for it but that doesn't mean she didn't want it, right?\nWant to see more fast boats? Check out the SocalJetBoats Youtube channel. \n\nThe jet drive came from American Turbine http://www.americanturbine.com/ and was blueprinted by Big League Performance Marine https://www.facebook.com/blrmarine/\n\nThe engine came from Texas Speed and features Nelson Racing Engines 72mm Mirror Image turbochargers https://nelsonracingengines.com/\n\nFuel for this beast was provided by twin Aeromotive brushless fuel pumps mounted in custom fuel cells that were built by Ryan Rakestraw, myself and David Newbern. https://aeromotiveinc.com/product/5-0-brushless-gear-pump-module/\n\nThe Electronic fuel injection, igntion, and data acuisition systems are all run by a new Holley Dominator lightweight ECU. https://www.holley.com/products/fuel_systems/fuel_injection/dominator_efi/dominator_ecu/parts/554-114LW\n\nand Smart Coils: https://www.holley.com/products/ignition/smart_coil_and_components/parts/556-128\n\nand Motion Raceworks provided its Icon 102 mm throttlebody, plus other bits to plumb the hot and cold sides of the turbo system: https://www.motionraceworks.com/collections/throttle-bodies-efi/products/motion-raceworks-icon-102mm-interchangeable-throttle-body\n\nhttps://www.motionraceworks.com/products/ls-build-your-own-steam-pro-kit\n\nhttps://www.motionraceworks.com/products/motion-45-46-50mm-wastegate-merge\n\nStainless Header MFR made these incredibly compact log style manifolds, which made plumbing the hot side of the turbo system super easy: \nhttps://www.stainlessheaders.com/product/Modular_Chevy_LS_Turbo_Header_Straight_Exit/\n\nWant to help support my channel?
