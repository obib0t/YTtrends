{"description":"Legendary Overwatch content creator Seagull broke an almost 2 year hiatus from YouTube to make a video explaining his disappointment in Overwatch 2. Of course, Seagull's video is excellently produced, but I can't help but disagree with his pessimism when much of the boosts for the \"Early Access Overwatch 2 PvP Update\" are in response to his original criticisms in the State of Overwatch 1 video. Of course, it's hard to have faith in a new business model we have yet to see and who knows what state the PvED truly is in, but with tempered expectations for now I'm happy to be back on track at least for the live service PvP game.

This review will contain some spoilers for certain things to add some context but I won't be spoiling any of the major deaths or reveals that happen down the line. Now the episode itself takes place during the red spring which was started last week with Laenas death. This happened during the first few days of 120 AC and like our own 20s it was complete s**t show. Shortly after this happened Harwin ended up perishing in the fire of Haranhaal along with his father Lyonel.\n\nIn the books Septon Eustice actually suspected Daemon of doing this and with the murder of Lady Rhea, Alicent might end up using him as a way to further push that side of the family away from the throne.\n\nI'll talk about the other events that happened in the year as we get further into the breakdown but the entire year saw some major shakeups that will have massive rammifications for whats to come.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but if you've been enjoying the video then please hit the thumbs up. Hit the subscribe button if you want your daughters to marry my sons and we can finally join our houses in this great union. With that out the way, thanks for clicking this now let's get into House Of The Dragon.\n\n-\n\nNow we open the book with Laena's funeral and all the houses gathered together to pay their respects. Ey shut up...he...he nah is pretty funny.\n\nAnyway her sarcophagus is clearly based on the ones that Ancient Egyptians used to bury their Pharaohs.\n\nThere is the Seahorse Sigil that the family has on the bottom and we can also see that there's a strong focus on the hair around the face. Like the Targaryens, The Valeryons were known for their distinctive hairstyles and that's why Alicent became so suspicious when Rhaenyras kids came out with neither. The Strongs in the books were described as having brown hair and pug noses and this is a similar sort of thing to how Ned discovered that Cersi's kids weren't Robert Baratheons.","title":"HOUSE OF THE DRAGON Episode 7 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Of Thrones Easter Eggs","duration":1511,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20221003","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snuhcluoZho","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/snuhcluoZho/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":532689}}

{"description":"Shifting wind patterns are making extreme weather events more likely. This is because the wind, which distributes areas of high and low pressure along the latitude lines of the Earth, is also being influenced by climate change.\n\nThe wind is the motor for our weather. It brings us both sunshine and rain. And during the winter months, it regularly blows itself up into heavy storms. But throughout the globe, climate change is causing shifts in existing wind systems - with devastating consequences. Atlantic hurricanes, which build up over the tropics and often lay waste to swathes of land on the eastern coast of the US, are becoming more intense and bringing heavier rainfall.\n\nScientists are looking for clues as to the precise causes for the warming in the Arctic, where temperatures are climbing more rapidly than anywhere else in the world. In the northern hemisphere, rising temperatures result in wind systems ‘twisting’ at 10-kilometer altitudes. The Arctic jet stream drives high- and low-pressure areas around the globe. It travels around the planet from west to east at speeds of up to 500 kilometers an hour. But in recent years, meteorologists have noticed more frequent weaker phases in the jet stream - with fatal consequences for Europe. Droughts like the one experienced in 2018 and flood catastrophes like that of 2021 are both likely to recur.\n\nResearchers on the island of Spitsbergen have already made an alarming discovery. Climate change is altering the wind, and the altered wind is accelerating climate change - a dangerous vicious cycle.\n\n#dwdocumentary #documentary #climatechange \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You'll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories- or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you're low on funds. Jobs and missions pay well, but you'll need to use that money to maintain your truck. When you think your truck is powerful enough, and you have enough bankroll for major repairs, use your truck to complete some of the map's challenges, such as races, rock crawls, hill climbs, and very destructive long jumps.\n\nIf you're not good with mechanics, don't worry. Your truck comes with a fully illustrated service manual.

{"description":"Goals from Thomas Partey, Gabriel Jesus and Granit Xhaka ensured derby day delight for us as we beat our arch-rivals to maintain top spot in the Premier League table.\n\nPartey’s wonderful strike from distance set us on our way, and despite a Harry Kane penalty ensuring the sides went in level at the break, a poacher’s effort from Jesus restored our lead four minutes into the second half.\n\nEmerson Royal was then red carded for the visitors and soon after Xhaka drove in a third to secure a third straight home victor in this fixture for the first time since 2013.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing ahead of kick-off as our Gooners created a cauldron of noise, and their efforts in the stands were matched on the field as we bossed the opening half an hour.\n\nThe game was just two minutes old when Gabriel Martinelli saw a volley smack off Hugo Lloris’ post, and then Granit Xhaka saw an imaginative flick towards goal spin narrowly wide after a wonderful cross from Bukayo Saka.\n\nAnd on 20 minutes, we grabbed the lead with an absolute blockbuster. Saka was again involved, receiving possession on the right and found Ben White. He laid the ball off to Partey who curled it towards goal first-time from 25 yards, and saw it flash past Lloris and into the top corner to send the already-high decibel levels stratospheric.\n\nBut for all our early dominance, Spurs found a way back level just 10 minutes later when we failed to clear our lines from a counter-attack and Gabriel fouled Richarlison in the area. Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot, allowing Kane to convert from 12 yards for the seventh time in north London derbies.\n\nHaving levelled things up, Spurs’ tails were up and led to a shaky period for us with Kane heading straight at Ramsdale after another swift break, but we still nearly went into the break back in front when a mazy dribble in the box by Gabriel Jesus saw him beat two defenders but shoot straight at Lloris from close-range.\n\nHowever, just four minutes after the restart, the Brazilian did get his goal to flip the game back in our favour. Saka did well to jink inside from the right and get a shot away, which Lloris did well to parry. Cristian Romero dallied with the rebound, and inadvertently sent the ball squirming under his goalkeeper, allowing Jesus to pounce and slam it home.\n\nOur no. 9 looked destined to grab a second soon after but misplaced his header from an Oleksandr Zinchenko and sent a golden chance wide, but on 62 minutes we received another huge boost to our chances of victory when Royal was dismissed for a foul tackle from behind on Martinelli.\n\nSensing an opportunity to seal the win, we quickly pressed for a third goal and after Saka bent a shot wide after coming inside, it arrived. Martinelli scampered down the left flank and got to the edge of the box, before laying it off to Xhaka who drilled a low shot under Lloris and grab his second of the campaign and send the stadium into delirium.\n\nThat killed the game off as a contest and we easily saw out the final minutes amongst a crescendo of noise as we matched last season's fine result, ended our opponents' unbeaten start, remained on top spot and sent all Gooners home happy.\n\n#arsenal \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Kim Little, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

So we were itching to whip up another batch of franken makeup, and we realized lip glosses had escaped our grasp up until this point – but not anymore! So yet again, we raided Sephora, buying one of each lip gloss they had in stock and then mixing them all together into one franken-batch to rule them all. What did you think of our final color? \n\nAlso also, if you’d like to learn more about the makeup recycling service that we used at Nordstrom, you can read about it on their site here: https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/get-involved/nordstrom-beauty-cycle \n\nOn top of all of that, if you’d like to buy yourself some of our Fiendish Behavior merchandise, you can check out our shop here: https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nPS - in case you want some more from us, we did just post ANOTHER franken video today over on Tyler’s channel. It features us testing out our own separate approaches towards frankening together one of every oreo flavor we could find. We’re calling it the Frank-Off! So be sure to check it out as well.

What’s coming next? \nFrom your inventions?\nWe wonder where, where does it end?\nWho can foresee, see what will be?\n\n\n========= Historic Fact ==========\n\nFritz Haber, often referred to as the “father of chemical warfare”, weaponised lethal gas for the Germans during World War I.
