With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.

{"description":"Matt called and said he was having issues with his transfer case in The Heavy Wrecker and might not make it to King Of The Hammers. So I loaded up some parts from Off-Road Design and headed over to help. We got all the parts swapped over to the standard Np205 and mated up the ORD Magnum Box and got it all mounted in the Heavy Wrecker. The next morning we took it out for a quick shake down run. Had a couple issues... One being some loose wiring and one being the steering column broke, but we were there to help him get it back together and keep going. I appreciate @MattsOffRoadRecovery allowing me to help them get this beast up and going and able to make it out to The Hammers.

{"description":"Continuing the #Disney100 celebration with this new look at #TheLittleMermaid! Just 100 days until it arrives in theaters!\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall‚Äôs live-action reimagining of the studio‚Äôs Oscar¬Æ-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton‚Äôs daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life ‚Äì and her father‚Äôs crown ‚Äì in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (‚Äúgrown-ish‚Äù) as Ariel; Tony Award¬Æ winner Daveed Diggs (‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù ‚ÄúSnowpiercer‚Äù) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (‚ÄúLuca,‚Äù ‚ÄúRoom‚Äù) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (‚ÄúRaya and the Last Dragon‚Äù) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (‚ÄúA Dog‚Äôs Way Home‚Äù) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (‚ÄúHomeland‚Äù) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù) as Queen Selina; with Oscar¬Æ winner Javier Bardem (‚ÄúNo Country for Old Men,‚Äù ‚ÄúBeing the Ricardos‚Äù) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award¬Æ nominee Melissa McCarthy (‚ÄúCan You Ever Forgive Me?‚Äù ‚ÄúBridesmaids‚Äù) as Ursula.      \n\n‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù is directed by Oscar¬Æ nominee Rob Marshall (‚ÄúChicago,‚Äù ‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (‚ÄúLife of Pi,‚Äù ‚ÄúFinding Neverland‚Äù), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (‚ÄúTony Bennett: An American Classic‚Äù), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy¬Æ winner Marc Platt (‚ÄúJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,‚Äù ‚ÄúGrease Live!‚Äù), three-time Tony Award¬Æ winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award¬Æ winner Alan Menken (‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin‚Äù), who won two Oscars¬Æ for the music in the animated version of ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns,‚Äù ‚ÄúInto the Woods‚Äù).
