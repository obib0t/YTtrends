{"description":"Stephen Thompson | August 15, 2023\nThe Tiny Desk has hosted plenty of major pop, rock and hip-hop stars in its 15-plus years, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one more agreeable or self-effacing than Austin Richard Post. Whether lamenting the state of his singing voice, joking about his nerves or sitting slack-jawed in awe of the fantastic band his people had assembled for this show, Post had the bearing of a lottery winner who wouldn't even give himself credit for buying a ticket.\n\nBefore, during and after the show, Post Malone was a joy to have around. But he also just happened to bring a few of the biggest pop hits of the 21st century: Set-opener \"Sunflower,\" for example, has been certified eighteen-times platinum by the RIAA since its release in 2018 — that's an all-time record — while the 2017 single \"I Fall Apart\" and 2019's \"Circles\" lag behind at a mere ten-times platinum apiece. \"Enough Is Enough,\" which closes this set, enjoys no such designation, but give it time: A track from Post Malone's new album Austin, it's only been out for a few weeks.\n\nSo enjoy this set for what it is: one of the world's biggest stars, performing a few of the world's biggest songs, each set to a luminous arrangement. Post Malone himself seems surprised by how great this Tiny Desk concert sounds, and that's not just the humility talking.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Sunflower\"\n\"I Fall Apart\"\n\"Circles\"\n\"Enough Is Enough\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAustin Post: lead vocalist, guitar \nHannah Juliano: vocalist\nElliot Aguilar: vocalist\nChauncey Matthews: vocalist\nKola Rail: vocalist\nDestin Johnson: drums\nEmily Rosenfield: guitar \nBobby Wooten: bass \nLouis Bell: piano\nKevin Kuh: strings \nFrancesca Dardani: strings \nKiku Enomoto: strings\nKirin McElwain: strings\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Suraya Mohamed\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Zayrha Rodriguez, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Team: Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #postmalone","title":"Post Malone: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1088,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230815","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCcks-fwq2c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCcks-fwq2c/hqdefault.jpg?v=64da7e22","content":{"View count":2313954}}

Experience the rush and fatigue of a high-pressure game with the Exhaust Engine, where sustained pressure in the attack zone leads to new game-changing effects like goalie fatigue that slows the netminder’s reaction time the more they get worn down with offensive action; change the momentum with Physics-Based Contact as you break the glass and send players into the bench with big body checks; and get unparalleled player command with the new Vision Passing System and Total Control Skill Moves.\n\nChel is more connected than ever with cross-play in all online team play modes, along with HUT Moments, which lets you recreate classic moments in hockey history and today’s biggest plays. Adding an extra layer of authenticity, Flex Moments introduces 75+ new goal celebrations, and a wholly refreshed presentation complements an enriched crowd atmosphere that makes playing the game feel like you’re at the game.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more NHL 24 Trailers: https://bit.ly/3kF5rTK\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsnhl\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsnhl \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/easportsnhl\n\n\n#NHL24 #Reveal","title":"NHL 24 Gameplay Reveal | Official Trailer","duration":321,"channel_id":"UCLydKeNR8rf-yoUu9J2acMg","author":"EA SPORTS NHL","date":"20230816","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSbtHgyMrX4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/TSbtHgyMrX4/hqdefault.webp?v=64dce76c","content":{"View count":210275}}

{"description":"Nuclear-weapons physicist Greg Spriggs rates seven nuclear-explosion scenes in movies.\n\nHe analyzes the portrayal of nuclear detonations and their effects in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” (2008), starring Harrison Ford; “Broken Arrow” (1996), starring John Travolta; Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012), starring Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, and Anne Hathaway; and Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” (1964). He also comments on what a nuclear explosion in outer space would really look like in comparison to Marvel’s “The Avengers” (2012), starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson; and Michael Bay’s “Armageddon” (1998), starring Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, and Liv Tyler. He breaks down the underwater detonation seen in “American Assassin” (2017), starring Michael Keaton. And he explains how accurate Christopher Nolan’s recreation of the construction of the first atomic bomb in Los Alamos and the subsequent Trinity test was in \"Oppenheimer” (2023), starring Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh.\n\nSpriggs has been a nuclear-weapons physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for 20 years. He worked on a special project where he scanned, reanalyzed, and declassified old nuclear test films.\n\nYou can find more information about the Livermore National Laboratory at: www.llnl.gov\n\nThese movies show simulations of the effects of using nuclear weapons near the public. To date, the 1945 atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the only instances of nuclear weapons being detonated as an act of war.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

{"description":"The death toll from the wildfires in Maui now stands at 80, and about a thousand people remain missing. The fire is now mostly contained and some survivors are returning to find their community in ruins. Global’s Neetu Garcha is in Maui and has been speaking with evacuees including a Canadian school principal.\n\nResidents say the wildfires hit without warning and some are now demanding to know why their large seaside community was caught off guard. As Reggie Cecchini explains, experts say this fire offers lessons for the future. \n\nAt least six asylum seekers have been killed after their boat sank in the English Channel. It’s the latest in a string of similar tragedies. More than 1,000 migrants have tried to make the journey to the UK by boat in just the last two days. As Touria Izri reports, those who survived the journey, face tough, new immigration measures.\n\nWith no end in sight to the war in Ukraine, tensions are rising in neighbouring Poland – particularly along its border with Belarus. The Polish government claims Belarussian military helicopters entered its airspace at the beginning of the month. In response, Poland’s government ordered 10,000 troops to the border to bolster defences – while on the other side, mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner group are reportedly training Belarussian forces. Those military maneuvers are making NATO nations nervous. Tonight, Crystal Goomansingh looks at the work underway to keep Poland safe.\n\nArtificial Intelligence just might join you on your next vacation. Tourism Jasper in Alberta’s rocky mountains is now using AI in hopes of making the destination more popular. And they’re not alone- as Heather Yourex-West explains, applications like ChatGPT and Oliver A.I. are taking the industry by storm.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/national/program/global-national\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #globalnational","title":"Global National: Aug. 12, 2023 | How Maui was caught off guard by catastrophic wildfires","duration":1224,"channel_id":"UChLtXXpo4Ge1ReTEboVvTDg","author":"Global News","date":"20230813","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uvpq0jkgA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/U2Uvpq0jkgA/hqdefault.webp?v=64d82cc3","content":{"View count":584087}}

This arose in a discussion about Kodak Black, who was given a Rolls-Royce Phantom for contributing a verse to a song. When Vlad questioned the wisdom of owning multiple cars, Boosie defended the practice claiming they are an investment and a source of additional income if needed. In support of this practice, Boosie referred to a period when he was incarcerated and paid his bond by selling one of his cars. Vlad echoed Boosie’s sentiment, adding that smart financial habits can only be learned through experience. Both agreed that material possessions are not worth as much as personal freedom and should not be viewed as a permanent asset.","title":"Boosie on Kodak Black Clowning Him for Selling Rolls Royce to Pay for Legal Fees (Part 10)","duration":287,"channel_id":"UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","author":"djvlad","date":"20230811","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWYD9av1XcY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dWYD9av1XcY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":828500}}

As Tommy leaves New York after losing Ghost, LaKeisha and the only city he's ever known, he makes a quick detour to close an old wound that’s been haunting him for decades. What was supposed to be a quick stop turns into a labyrinth of family secrets and lies Tommy thought were long buried.  One step leads to another and Tommy quickly finds himself in Chicago's drug game, inserting himself between the city's two biggest crews. In a city divided by race, Tommy straddles the line, ultimately becoming the lynchpin that not only unites them - but holds the POWER to watch them crumble. As the first season unfolds at breakneck speed, Tommy uses his outsider status to his advantage, breaking all the local rules and rewriting them on his quest to become the biggest drug dealer in Chicago.v","title":"Power Book IV: Force | Official Trailer | Season 2","duration":119,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230810","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02K63ZxlZo4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/02K63ZxlZo4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":5422849}}
