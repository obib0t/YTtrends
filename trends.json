{"description":"Night Swim\nComing Soon to Theaters\n\nNo running. No diving. No lifeguard on duty. No swimming after dark. \n\nAtomic Monster and Blumhouse, the producers of M3GAN, high dive into the deep end of horror with the new supernatural thriller, Night Swim. \n\nBased on the acclaimed 2014 short film by Rod Blackhurst and Bryce McGuire, the film stars Wyatt Russell (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) as Ray Waller, a former major league baseball player forced into early retirement by a degenerative illness, who moves into a new home with his concerned wife Eve (Oscar® nominee Kerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin), teenage daughter Izzy (Amélie Hoeferle, this fall’s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes) and young son Elliot (Gavin Warren, Fear the Walking Dead). \n\nSecretly hoping, against the odds, to return to pro ball, Ray persuades Eve that the new home’s shimmering backyard swimming pool will be fun for the kids and provide physical therapy for him. But a dark secret in the home’s past will unleash a malevolent force that will drag the family under, into the depths of inescapable terror. \n\nNight Swim is written and directed by Bryce McGuire (writer of the upcoming film Baghead) and is produced by James Wan, the filmmaker behind the Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring franchises, and Jason Blum, the producer of the Halloween films, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man. The film is executive produced by Michael Clear and Judson Scott for Wan’s Atomic Monster and by Ryan Turek for Blum’s Blumhouse.\n\nSocial Pages:\n\nFacebook: Facebook.com/nightswimmovie\n\nInstagram: Instagram.com/nightswimmovie\n\nX: x.com/nightswimmovie","title":"Night Swim | Official Trailer","duration":117,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231005","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/pcSNqteCEtE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1360442}}

In lieu of a silky smooth twin turbo V12, the Spectre has two electric motors making a silent 577 horsepower and 664 lb ft of torque. Befitting a true Rolls Royce, the Spectre is bespoke to the buyer and has numerous options to beautify both the interior and exterior with artistic designs. It also aims to provide a cabin that is effortless, comfortable and quiet. \n\nBut how has the transition to electric power affected the driver and their passengers' enjoyment of a Rolls Royce?

Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMB01F5ZJCRFJBFO","title":"We Left for a Cabin in the Woods","duration":1325,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQGWIkKB8l8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JQGWIkKB8l8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":132458}}

Witness water roaring into basements, stranded vehicles, and impassable roads that brought the Big Apple to a standstill.\n\nThis video dives deep into the heart of the devastation, spotlighting the worst affected regions like Brooklyn and Long Island.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 $8k per night villa!\n01:27 Royal Villa tour\n02:00 how did we get here?\n03:04 full resort tour: Conrad Bora Bora\n09:00 Kardashian’s stayed here!\n12:18 swimming with manta rays\n16:30 Presidential Villa tour!!🙌🏻\n25:00 Nate attempts to win 5 free nights😍\n27:45 Bloops","title":"We Stayed in Bora Bora's Most Expensive Overwater Villa","duration":1738,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDIp0Vu9iII","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NDIp0Vu9iII/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":912349}}

{"description":"Stephen Thompson | September 29, 2023\nWhat you've got here is a perfect 20-minute distillation of The Sam Smith Experience: The Grammy-winning 2014 ballad that kicked off the singer's career (\"Stay With Me\"), a sleek dance-pop banger (\"How Do You Sleep\") and a chart-topping dollop of debauched hedonism (\"Unholy\") bundled together with \"Lay Me Down,\" in which Smith performed a gorgeous duet with LaDonna Harley-Peters. From the stately to the louche and bawdy — Smith even introduced \"Unholy\" with a perfect summation of their recent artistic direction: \"Let's get saucy!\" — it's all here.\n\nPerforming with an 11-person choir and two instrumentalists — sadly, Kim Petras wasn't there to emerge from between Smith's legs as if she were being birthed — Smith brought an overflowing bag of tricks to the proceedings. But what really shone through was a sense of movement: Each song swayed and played effervescently, centering Smith while also elevating every other magnificent voice in support. This set may not serve as anyone's introduction to the music of Sam Smith, but it's still a hell of a gateway — and a joy to behold.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Stay With Me\"\n\"How Do You Sleep\"\n\"Lay Me Down (feat.
