{"description":"Bobby Carter | September 8, 2022\nEverything JID does is intricately detailed. He seems to care much more than the average emcee, and throughout this entire production, I felt his strong desire to get it right. The weight was lifted from his shoulders at the midway point of the set as he turned to his band, saying, \"We're pretty hot guys. We're pretty f***ing hot.\" In this performance, recorded weeks before the release of his now widely praised third studio album, The Forever Story, the East Atlanta native performs songs from the album live for the first time, plus career-defining songs in ways we've never heard before.\n\nThe origin of JID makes up the puzzle pieces in The Forever Story. It's the story of a kid with derailed football dreams, searching for purpose until it found him. These are tales that many kids from the inner city can relate to — but what sets JID's story apart is that nobody raps like him. His music casts a wide net, considering history, family and hometown, and connecting with hip-hop enthusiasts and music nerds alike.\n\nIn these stripped-down versions of songs like \"Never\" and \"Surround Sound,\" the focus is on how JID can manipulate pitch, bend words and hop from one cadence to another. After he playfully cuts the \"Usher tension,\" he and his stacked band and backup singers close with the powerful and spiritual \"Kody Blu 31.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Galaxy\"\n\"Workin Out\"\n\"Off da Zoinkys\"\n\"Never\"\n\"Sistanem\"\n\"Surround Sound\"\n\"Kody Blu 31\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJID: vocals\nNajinga Luster: vocals\nRashida Chitunda: vocals\nTeja Lanier Veal: bass\nGrady Housworth: trombone\nAllan Knighton: saxophone\nMichael Cruse: trumpet\nSamuel Williams: keys\nDivante Davis: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Alanté Serene\nAudio Assistant: Andie Huether\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #JID","title":"JID: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1323,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsaZRcL-OTQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gsaZRcL-OTQ/hqdefault.webp?v=63191459","content":{"View count":321117}}

{"description":"Watch the teaser trailer for #ThePeripheral starring Chloë Grace Moretz – streaming exclusively on Prime Video October 21.\n\nThe Peripheral centers on Flynne Fisher, a woman trying to hold together the pieces of her broken family in a forgotten corner of tomorrow's America.  Flynne is smart, ambitious, and doomed.  She has no future. Until the future comes calling for her. The Peripheral is master storyteller William Gibson’s dazzling, hallucinatory glimpse into the fate of mankind — and what lies beyond.  \n\nFlynne Fisher lives in the rural American South, working at the local 3D printing shop, while earning much needed extra money playing VR games for rich people.  One night she dons a headset and finds herself in futuristic London—a sleek and mysterious world, alluringly different from her own hardscrabble existence.  \nBut this isn’t like any game she’s ever played before:  Flynne begins to realize it isn’t virtual reality… it’s real.  Someone in London, seventy years in the future, has found a way to open a door to Flynne’s world.  And as utterly beguiling as London is… it’s also dangerous.  As Flynne searches to discover who has connected their worlds, and for what purpose, her presence here sets dangerous forces into motion…forces intent on destroying Flynne and her family in her own world.","title":"The Peripheral Season 1 - Teaser Trailer | Prime Video","duration":110,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSaWHbCSmRI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RSaWHbCSmRI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":481818}}

{"description":"A beautifully crafted story of forbidden love and changing social conventions, My Policeman follows three young people - policeman Tom (Harry Styles), teacher Marion (Emma Corrin) and museum curator Patrick (David Dawson) as they embark on an emotional journey in 1950s Britain. Flashing forward to the 1990s, Tom (Linus Roache), Marion (Gina McKee) and Patrick (Rupert Everett) are still reeling with longing and regret, but now they have one last chance to repair the damage of the past. Based on the book by Bethan Roberts, director Michael Grandage carves a visually transporting, heart-stopping portrait of three people caught up in the shifting tides of history, liberty, and forgiveness.\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

Disconnectedness and loneliness are widespread. \n\nMany people want more close friends but don’t know how to get them.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Prodcuts designed with ❤ https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3BgSE4e\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3AIeV9i\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nMarius Kawahara-Lieben, Matt Smith, Brittany Grace, Autumn Weddell, SULTAN ALVI ALADIN, Arlent M.

{"description":"TULSA KING follows New York mafia capo Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone), just after he is released from prison after 25 years and unceremoniously exiled by his boss to set up shop in Tulsa, Okla. Realizing that his mob family may not have his best interests in mind, Dwight slowly builds a \"crew\" from a group of unlikely characters, to help him establish a new criminal empire in a place that to him might as well be another planet. The series also stars Andrea Savage (\"I'm Sorry\"), Martin Starr (\"Silicon Valley\"), Max Casella (\"The Tender Bar\"), Domenick Lombardozzi (\"The Irishman\"), Vincent Piazza (\"Boardwalk Empire\"), Jay Will (\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\"), A.C. Peterson (\"Superman & Lois\") with Garrett Hedlund (\"The United States vs. Billie Holiday\").\n\nThe series will be executive-produced by Sheridan, Winter, Stallone, David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin and Allen Coulter.

{"description":"(Sept. 4, 2022) Top lightweight contender Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz (24-2-1, 17 KOs) delivered a highlight-reel knockout over veteran contender Eduardo Ramirez (27-3-3, 12 KOs) in the second round of their showdown.\n \nAlready a fan-favorite after giving three-division world champion Gervonta Davis all he could handle in defeat at this same arena last December, Mexico City’s Cruz entered the ring to roaring approval as he looked for another statement victory.\n \n\"I was ready to win at all costs, for my family and what better way to win than here in front of all the great fans in Los Angeles,” said Cruz.”\n \nMidway through round two, Davis showed the fight-changing power that he possesses and that has helped make him a fan favorite in Los Angeles and beyond. Cruz first connected flush with a big left hook around a Ramirez jab that sent Ramirez to the mat hard.\n \nWhile Ramirez was able to get to his feet, Cruz pushed forward, sensing his moment to end the fight. Using a feint right hand, Ramirez caught Cruz cleanly with another left hook and followed up with a powerful right hand to score a second knockdown. This time referee Jack Reiss jumped in immediately and halt the bout 2:27 into the round.\n \n\"I lost and I have to accept that,” said Ramirez. “I'll get better and move forward. I felt like I was fighting well and then everything turned all of a sudden. That's just boxing. Now I'm going to rest, recover and plan my next moves going forward. But I'll definitely be back, you can count on that.\"\n\n#IsaacCruz #EduardoRamirez #CruzRamirez \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Cruz vs Ramirez FIGHT HIGHLIGHTS: September 4, 2022 | PBC on FOX PPV","duration":120,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20220905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7naL2FFdg2Y","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7naL2FFdg2Y/hqdefault.jpg?v=6315aca0","content":{"View count":985103}}

Though we don’t see those events in the Dragon Ball Super manga just assume it’s basically the same as the movie. Goku and Vegeta are training and talking about never fighting together again and doing all the other flirting you’d expect. Vegeta asks about Ultra Instinct but Goku says he hasn’t been able to use it a single time since the Tournament of Power. Their date gets interrupted by a call from Mr. Satan. Buu is being kidnapped so he needs Goku and Vegeta’s help.\n Goku tells Vegeta he’ll teleport them over, but Vegeta acts like a tsundere and says he’ll just fly there himself. Goku arrives first and handles the kidnappers. Vegeta gets there shortly after, but lets Goku handle it. One of the kidnappers hears Mr. Satan say Goku and Vegeta. He knows who they are and proceeds to effortlessly speed blitz both of them. Defeating them both with a stun gun. He tells the others to take Goku and Vegeta as well so with that, the kidnappers leave Earth.
