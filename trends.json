{"description":"IT'S MY BACHELORETTE WEEKEND!! I was soooo pumped to have great friends and twin who decided to throw me the best bachelorette weekend ever! \n\nIf you see Bailey doing most of the vlogging, it is because I just wanted to enjoy the weekend and still vlog for y‚Äôall!\n\nWe booked a cool cabin airbnb in Texas on a lake, and had the best time. I invited a handful of friends, old college roommates, sister-in-laws, and siblings! We had everything from matching pjs, to cute sweatshirts, to gift baskets I made for everyone. Of course we had classic bachelorette activities, starting with a girl‚Äôs night out! We also played games, swam, and hung out until early in the morning catching up with each other (though losing a lot of sleep haha!).

{"description":"-An overview of the drama unfolding over the ship channel in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n-Preorder my new book before the holiday rush: https://practical.engineering/book\n\nErrata:\nAt 3:08, the old Harbor Bridge actually does have narrow pedestrian walkways, but they lack connectivity with pedestrian infrastructure on either side of the bridge.\nAt 3:21, a clarification: The ships can't enter the port empty (because they would have too much air draft). That means they can't be fully loaded in the inner harbor because they are already carrying some weight when they enter.\nAt 12:40, I meant to say \"20% above their capacity\"\n\nIn July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Sponsor: Fractal Pop Air RGB Case on Amazon https://geni.us/TMxbP\nNVIDIA just announced the new GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080 16GB, and RTX 4080 12GB. The new cards use the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture and are priced at $900 for the 4080 12GB, $1200 for the RTX 4080 16GB, and $1600 for the RTX 4090 24GB cards. In this video, we also talk about the specs -- like CUDA core count, RT (ray tracing) performance expectations, power utilization and consumption targets, and memory bandwidth. NVIDIA additionally announced DLSS 3, which is a major step revision over DLSS 2 and could have wider-reaching implications outside of just the GPU space (and could impact CPU bottlenecked scenarios as well). We also briefly talk about some of the architectural changes, but we‚Äôll leave most of those until after NVIDIA‚Äôs architectural briefing with the press.\n\nGrab the BRAND NEW GN ‚ÄòAmp‚Äô Medium Modmat on the store and support our independent reviews, testing, and journalism: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/medium-modmat-v2\n\nEVGA DROPPED NVIDIA.

{"description":"Nope, the spelling isn‚Äôt wrong, Ariel is merely using the word differently, a contraction of ‚ÄòHigh Performance Carbon Reduction‚Äô. So 'Hipercar'. Carbon emissions rather than carbon fibre. There‚Äôs a lot of the latter about, although underneath the chassis is aluminium and most of the body sections are weighty 3D-printed test panels. It‚Äôs 1,759kg as it sits here, but Ariel is confident of dropping that below 1,500kg with full carbon panels and carbon wheels. The jet turbine is a range extender ‚Äì it exists to charge the 56kWh battery, not drive the wheels. Available as either 2WD or 4WD, with or without the jet turbine, full house versions are likely to be knocking on the door of seven figures. That‚Äôs a complete sea change for Ariel, for a car without classic hypercar elegance. But this is new tech, new age, new customer base.
