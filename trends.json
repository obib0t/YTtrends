{"description":"-An overview of the drama unfolding over the ship channel in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n-Preorder my new book before the holiday rush: https://practical.engineering/book\n\nIn July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Sponsor: HYTE Y60 computer case on Amazon - https://geni.us/3ngWP\nEVGA has terminated its relationship with NVIDIA. EVGA will no longer be manufacturing video cards of any type, citing a souring relationship with NVIDIA as the cause (among other reasons that were minimized). EVGA will not be exploring relationships with AMD or Intel at this time, and the company will be downsizing imminently as it exits the video card market. Customers will still be covered by EVGA policies, but EVGA will no longer make RTX or other video cards.

{"description":"A day in the life of a Japanese waitress in Tokyo working at a Japanese teppanyaki restaurant.  This is a typical work day for a waitress in the Japanese food industry and the typical working hours in Japan.  This is a look inside of Japanese work culture in Japanese restaurants.  Working in Japan is quite unique and depending on the industry may be a bit different from job to job, but many of the jobs also share similar characteristics.  The video follows Yuki in her typical japan work day from morning until the evening and everything that happens in between at work.  She arrives at the teppanyaki restaurant when it opens and leaves when it closes, very typical for Japanese restaurants.  Yuki is a waitress at Pandora, a Teppanyaki restaurant, Japanese style flat grill, which has been a local favorite since 1972 serving Kobe beef steaks and teppanyaki course meals. During her time working as a full-time waitress, she learned the importance of reading and anticipating the customers needs and acting beforehand.  It‚Äôs a strong part of a Japanese omotenashi culture, a deep and honest form of hospitality, treating customers with respect without asking for anything in return.  So for her, even a smile from her customers brings her true joy.  One of the main reasons why in Japan tips at the end of the meal are very uncustomary.  This among other things shared in this video is what makes working in Japan as a waitress very unique experience.\n\nWatch all of my Japan Day in the Life videos on this playlist\n- https://tokyozebra.com/ditl\n\nPandora Restaurant\n2F - https://maps.app.goo.gl/LnRPN96XcFRUyyPz5?g_st=ic\n4F - https://maps.app.goo.gl/yXDjN92hVCtffdddA?g_st=ic\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi3CubfpdU3GpoHtX1Cy46A\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?

It‚Äôs why in just one year‚Äôs time, he‚Äôs already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80‚Äôs hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song ‚ÄúNever Comin‚Äô Home‚Äù amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, ‚ÄúFall In Love‚Äù, ‚ÄúRock and A Hard Place‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWhere It Ends‚Äù. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #NeverLeave #LyricVideo","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Never Leave (Lyric Video)","duration":204,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20220915","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmz6EueDmpE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rmz6EueDmpE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":349936}}
{"description":"Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nShe became Queen in 1952 at the age of 25 and spent 70 years on the throne. She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \"it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \"rock\".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign.","title":"Queen Elizabeth II dies aged 96","duration":1369,"channel_id":"UCTrQ7HXWRRxr7OsOtodr2_w","author":"Channel 4 News","date":"20220908","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYGByWrjyFw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mYGByWrjyFw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":6355938}}

Omar Apollo kicks off Latinx Heritage Month with a full-band rendition of \"En El Olvido,\" backed by Las Mariachis Lindas, as he channels a childhood spent listening to Juan Gabriel into his performance of the Mexican corrido. \n\nIn the eternal wisdom of Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre, it's not a Mexican party until someone starts crying, and Apollo embraces esta melancol√≠a as the band slips into the easy R&B number \"Evergreen.\"  \"We're about to get more sad,\" he says to the crowd with a grin. \n\nDespite the heartbreak and unrequited love songs, there's a sense of ease in this Tiny Desk concert ‚Äî an easy camaraderie among the group as the members sing through \"Evergreen\" and \"Petrified\" before finishing with the (slightly) more upbeat \"Endlessly.\"  El coraz√≥n puede estar adolorido, but in community, the pain never seems hopeless. \n\nAs Apollo's Tiny Desk comes to an end, he offers the audience a homework assignment for self-improvement, for putting the negative behind you and making yourself available to participate in building community: \"I want y'all to think about something,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI want you to go home, I want you to meditate and I want you to just burn the bridge.\" He laughs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing!‚Äù But as his and the band‚Äôs joyful energy attests, in the world of Omar Apollo, there‚Äôs only room for building each other up. \n\nSET LIST\n‚ÄúEn El Olvido‚Äù\n‚ÄúEvergreen‚Äù\n‚ÄúPetrified‚Äù\n‚ÄúEndlessly‚Äù\n\nMUSICIANS\nOmar Apollo: vocals\nJonah Feingold: guitar\nJackson Shanks: drums\nManny Barajas: bass\nHarrison Hawkins: keys, music director\nAstyn Turrentine: vocals\nPhylicia Hill: vocals\nBrian Antonio Gazo Martinez: vocals\nFabian Anthony Chavez: saxophone\nMarcus Clayton Paul: trumpet\nSilvia Estrada: guitarr√≥n\nMayra Mart√≠nez: guitarr√≥n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nDirector: Kara Frame\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAnimator: Alant√© Serene\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Pierre Kattar\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Copeland\nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alant√© Serene, Joby Tanseco\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#TinyDesk #NPRMusic #ElTiny #OmarApollo","title":"Omar Apollo: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1093,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220915","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p78XATPcyg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7p78XATPcyg/hqdefault.jpg?v=632258af","content":{"View count":430379}}
