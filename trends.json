{"description":"Sweden and Belgium faced off in their qualification match for the UEFA 2024 Euro. Belgium took strong control on the pitch from the jump and Romelu Lukaku found his first goal of three in the 35th minute with a header to the bottom left corner. In the 49th minute, Lukaku scored his second from very close range to the bottom right corner following a corner and assist from Dodi Luk√©bakio. Sweden‚Äôs Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá (Euro qualifier‚Äôs oldest player) entered the pitch in the 73d minute and had an excellent, though unsuccessful, header shot from inside the box. Lukaku secured his hat trick in the 82nd minute and Belgium went on to take a 3-0 finish home over Sweden.\n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #Belgium #Sweden\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n‚ñ∫PBC ON FOX‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n‚ñ∫WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n‚ñ∫NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n‚ñ∫CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer‚Äôs YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

{"description":"Italy and England begun their qualification journey to the 2024 Euros with an entertaining matchup! England jumped to a hot start in the first half and didn't look back, highlighted from goals by Declan Rica and Harry Kane. With his 54th goal in international competition, Kane become the record goal scorer for England. Italy failed to make much of a mark in the first half, but was able to change this during the second half. Featuring a pass from Lorenzo Pellegrini, Mateo Retegui slotted a beautiful strike to grab his first goal in his debut match.  Italy continued to press, looking for that second goal to tie the match, but England was able to hold on to a 2-1 victory for the first time since 1961 at Italy. \n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #England\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n‚ñ∫PBC ON FOX‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n‚ñ∫WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n‚ñ∫NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n‚ñ∫CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer‚Äôs YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

We explore that using numbers generated from our last episode, where the Z06 beat a Porsche 911 GT3 (992), an Audi R8 V10 Performance, and almost kept up with a Ducati Panigale V4 SP2.\n\nUsing his signature time-freeze technique, veteran automotive journalist Jason Cammisa shows us the outcome of the race and explains how it happened by walking back through slow-mo time at the finish line.\n\nThe Corvette E-Ray combines the Z06's wide body with the base Stingray's 6.2-liter LS2 V-8 and a front-mounted, 160-hp electric motor. Launches are now wheelspin-free and no-drama as the E-Ray rockets from 0-60 in just 2.4 seconds ‚Äî making this the quickest Corvette in history.\n\nAnd, at 3925 lb, the heaviest. But also the first AWD Corvette and the first-ever hybrid Corvette. \n\nIt's a very quick sign of things to come!\n\n===\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

{"description":"Today AD is welcomed to Columbus, Ohio by Debby Ryan and Josh Dun for a tour of their fascinating, ‚Äòtreehouse fantasy‚Äô home. It might be surprising to hear of a sparkling young actor and her rocker husband setting up their first house in the ‚ÄúArch City,‚Äù but Ryan and¬†Dun relish an impulsive departure from the script. When they discovered the property and decided to make it their home, the actor and musician tapped Fawn Galli and Ashley Moyer to bring their domestic dream to life.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ‚ñ∫https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ‚ñ∫https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"We SPILLED CORN While Loading the Truck!

{"description":"Months after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, I began filming the U.S. Army‚Äôs 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment (known as the Gunners) in Baghdad. The unit was housed in a bombed-out palace on the banks of the Tigris that they named Gunner Palace.\n\nRather than just making a movie about the men, I suggested that we make a film together ‚Äî an offer that the soldiers quickly embraced. They told the story of the war as only they could: They played guitar, spat out rhymes and played to the camera. But behind all their bravado and posturing, they were just kids who desperately wanted the world to understand the war through their eyes.\n\nIn the last two months of 2003, the Gunners lost three men to I.E.D. attacks. They scrambled to create makeshift armor for their soft-skinned vehicles using scrap metal. When asked by a soldier about the lack of armor in 2004, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said, ‚ÄúYou go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.‚Äù\n\nThey were the army we had. They fought an enemy they couldn‚Äôt always see in a land they didn‚Äôt understand for reasons that were never entirely clear. In the midst of the pandemic, I visited the men and spoke with them about how they make sense of their role in a war that has yet to be fully reckoned with. In \"The Army We Had,\" the veterans grapple with a past that still reverberates powerfully through their lives.\n\n- Text by Michael Tucker\n- Film by Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker\n\nMore from The New York Times Video: \nOp-Docs: https://www.nytimes.com/column/op-docs\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n‚Äã‚Äã\nWatch all of our videos here: http://nytimes.com/video‚Äã‚Äã\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nytvideo‚Äã‚Äã\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nytvideo‚Äã‚Äã\n----------\nOp-Docs is a forum for short, opinionated documentaries by independent filmmakers.

{"description":"Download Flip and get 30% off your first order with code \"Safiya\" at https://www.flip.shop/safiya - thanks again to Flip for sponsoring this video!! And make sure to follow me @safiyany on flip :)\n\nAnd thanks so much to Julia from Agile Styling for her consult! You can find her website and find out more about her color matching and styling services here: https://www.agilestyling.com/\n\nAnd follow her on TikTok & Instagram at: @agile_styling !\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! Today it‚Äôs all about color - and as someone who is known for wearing almost only black, I decided to dip my toes into the personal color analysis trend I've been hearing about for years and seeing all over TikTok. Because I've always been curious... am I a winter? Autumn? Summer? Or even Spring? Pastels have never been my forte, but I was open to at least *hearing* about them. So, we took a little detour to Toronto and visited Julia Dobkine from Agile Styling, an expert in color analysis who I‚Äôd been following on Tiktok, to find out my colors, my season, my tones, and everything underneath those tones. What do you guys think? Would you try this?\n\nAlso, thanks to the virtual color analysts, the color key, for their help in fact-checking the video and collaborating on celebrities for the 12 seasons for our graphics! To learn your season virtually, check out @‚Äåthecolorkey_ on Instagram! **celebrities shown here are examples based on the color key's best classification done in good faith but without participation in the color key analysis process. Accurate results can only be achieved through their color analysis process!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/‚Äã\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nMelissa Douglas\nPhil Kinney\nElizabeth Pinotti\nClare Gelber\nBree von Bradsky\nNez Covington\nIshara Mathews\nHailey Cox\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\n0:00 Intro\n3:20 Flying to Canada\n5:08 The Color Analyzing Process\n7:15 Finding Out My Undertones\n12:49 Finding Out My Colors' Brightness & Depth\n14:55 My Palette vs Other Palettes\n16:40 Shopping My Color Palette\n21:46 Doing Makeup in My Color Palette\n23:00 The Final Look\n24:31 Outro","title":"I Got A Professional Color Analysis","duration":1520,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230319","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvFD5KBAb0Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zvFD5KBAb0Q/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2137645}}

In this video, we continue our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support this potentially history-altering theory.\n\nMY SOCIALS:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/miniminuteman/\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@miniminuteman\nE-Mail (Business inquiries only.
