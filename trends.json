Brotato is a top-down arena shooter roguelite where you play a potato wielding up to 6 weapons at a time to fight off hordes of aliens. Choose from a variety of traits and items to create unique builds and survive until help arrives.\n\nOur build is going to be exploiting trees and the luck statistics to generate more upgrades than the game realistically expects and the luck stat ensures they are likely unique or legendary upgrades. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nBROTATO CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 - Coming up...\n00:07 - Welcome to BROTATO\n01:01 - Waves 1  - 20\n15:44 - Waves 21 - 29\n23:52 - Waves 40 - 49\n26:23 - THE FINAL WAVE: WAVE 50\n27:53 - Thank you and goodbye!\n\nTitle: I Became A God in BROTATO - A perfectly balanced game with no exploits\n\n#game #brotato #god","title":"I Became A GOD in BROTATO - A Perfectly Balanced Game with no exploits","duration":1704,"channel_id":"UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ","author":"The Spiffing Brit","date":"20230807","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaw3jLuIQ28","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iaw3jLuIQ28/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":436113}}

{"description":"The Real Reason Why Jimmy Uso Betrayed Jey Uso at WWE SummerSlam\n\nSummerSlam just came to a shocking end. Roman Reigns retained his WWE championship, but I don’t think anybody expected it happen like this. After a hard-fought battle, it looked like main event Jey Uso was going to win the world championship. It seemed like a perfect ending to The Bloodline story. After a big-time splash, Jey went for the pin. \n\nThe referee nearly counted three until a man with a hoodie pulled Jey Uso out of the ring. We come to find out that it’s his brother. Jimmy Uso returned and cost his brother the championship match. He then hit him with a superkick and sent him back in the ring to take one final spear that ended the match. \n\nRoman Reigns even looked shocked, so this wasn’t planned by him or Paul Heyman. Jimmy Uso came out to screw over his brother for a certain reason. What is that reason? Well, here’s the real reason why Jimmy Uso returned to betray his brother.\n\n#WWE #SummerSlam \n\nCan we REACH 5000 likes?\n\n►Help Me Reach 500K Subscribers - http://goo.gl/e0xMwh\n►My Twitter - https://twitter.com/valonpllana\n►My Instagram - https://instagram.com/valon.pllana\n\nFor copyright purposes, please email: business.pllana@gmail.com\n\n*Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

{"description":"Thanks to everyone for joining us for this race: \n- Red Bull: @redbullracing \n- Rimac: https://www.instagram.com/rimac_automobili/\n- McMurtry: https://www.instagram.com/mcmurtryautomotive/\n\nGet ready for the most exciting drag race in carwow history! \n\nWe’ve got the World Championship-winning Red Bull RB8 going up against the 1,914hp Rimac Nevera and the Goodwood Hillclimb record-holding McMurtry Spéirling!\n\nSo let’s see how these marvellous machines compare. Starting with the Rimac, it’s equipped with four electric motors that can produce an eye-watering 1,914hp and 2,360Nm of torque. It’s packing a 120kWh battery pack, so as a result it’s pretty heavy, tipping the scales at around 2,300kg. And as you can imagine, all of that power doesn’t come cheap, with the Nevera costing around £2,000,000! \n\nAlongside it we have the McMurtry. This single-seater EV is a whole lot lighter than the Rimac, weighing in at just 1,000kg. It’s also equipped with two electric motors that produce around 1,000hp, while also packing an incredible fan system that helps to generate 2,000kg of downforce! As a result, it can shoot off from the line like nothing you’ve ever seen before! But there’s a catch - it’s limited to a top speed of only 150mph...\n\nThen finally we have the F1 car, driven by Red Bull’s reserve driver, Liam Lawson. He’s driving Sebastian Vettel’s Championship-winning RB8, which is equipped with a 2.4-litre V8 that can produce 800hp. It’s easily the lightest car here, at around 700kg, and all power is sent to the rear wheels only. \n\nSo it’s an absolutely incredible line-up, but will electric power triumph?! Or will the F1 car prove victorious? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!\n\nMcMurtry Spéirling review & 1/4-mile: https://bit.ly/-McMurtry-Speirling-Review\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"F1 Car vs World's FASTEST Hypercars: DRAG RACE","duration":882,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230805","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCzCqqVGQYE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PCzCqqVGQYE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3313894}}

Furnace insulation stops heat being lost from the walls of a furnace and so increases the heat within the furnace. Dry wood ash makes an excellent insulator for heat as the fine particles separated by small air gaps don't allow heat to conduct very well. To make the furnace a double layered wall of clay was made and the space between was filled with wood ash from different fires. The clay needed to be completely dry before doing so however as it was important the the ash not get wet, which would cause it to loose its insulating properties.The furnace was tested with an iron smelt and it produced 34g of iron from 10 charges of ore. It was going quickly to start with but then I had issues with the blower towards the end of the smelt (broken housing). The furnace design is promising though as this produced the third best smelt I've done in the wild with natural tools and materials (the best were 39g and 41g over a year ago). I'll try it again later when I've replaced the broken forge blower. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Today AD is welcomed by John Legend and Chrissy Teigen to tour their loving family home in Beverly Hills. The superstar couple are no strangers to moving house as the chapters of their lives change, this time around wanting a magical space for their kids to grow up. John and Chrissy enlisted AD100 designer, Jake Arnold, working in tandem as he paired his signature earthy palette with their desire for bright pops of color. Together they designed an open space full of warmth with no shortage of spots for family time during their latest stage of life. “Every house we’ve ever had reflects the moment we were in in our lives, like chapters in a book,” Teigen avers. “We were attracted to this place because of its lightness and airiness. We love how open it feels, and how it’s so connected to the outdoors. We wanted to create something magical, especially for the kids,”\r\n\r\nSee more of John and Chrissy's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/john-legend-chrissy-teigen-california-home\r\n\r\nShop Chrissy and John’s home style!\r\n\r\nFurniture: \r\nCrate & Barrel Rumford Accent Chair by Jake Arnold: https://fave.co/3YhbUs6\r\n(Similar) Interior Icons Epic Round Pedestal Table: https://fave.co/3YiQJpI\r\n(Simlar) Duhome Round Faux Fur Bar Stools Set of 2: https://amzn.to/3rPfRbt\r\n(Similar) Target Alena Poly Blend Accent Chair: https://fave.co/44OWtKf\r\n(Similar) Perigold Serena Marble Top Coffee Table: https://fave.co/3KnObAF\r\n\r\nRugs: \r\nLulu and Georgia Wilcox Rug by Jake Arnold: https://fave.co/47ffOFS\r\n(Similar) Wayfair Martha Stewart Jute Rug: https://fave.co/3OC5FvG\r\n\r\nLighting:\r\nCrate & Barrel Ellery Tripod Table Lamp by Jake Arnold: https://fave.co/44M6NCM\r\n(Similar) 1stdibs Pair of Italian Murano Sconces: https://fave.co/3QgfTDn\r\n(Similar) Etsy Perforated Flushmount: https://fave.co/3rSCvzH\r\nVL9150 Vertical Vine Pendant: https://fave.co/47fGypZ\r\n(Similar) Etsy Brass Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3KJ7gxF\r\n\r\nAccessories: \r\nHerman Miller Wide Corduroy Pillow: https://fave.co/3rWdlzT\r\nFete Home Brass Obelisk: https://fave.co/3Kldljm\r\n(Similar) Urban Outfitters Selene Floor Mirror: https://fave.co/43PLhvm\r\n(Similar) Chairish Mid-Century Box Tray: https://fave.co/458DA4B\r\n(Similar) 1stdibs French Confit Pot: https://fave.co/3rLz3Xj\r\nCravings: All Together: Recipes to Love by Chrissy Teigen: https://amzn.to/3YbSHbj\r\n(Similar) East Fork Luisa Vino 3-Piece Glassware Set: https://fave.co/3DzgeJE\r\n(Similar) West Elm Kaloh Stoneware Condiment Bowl Sets: https://fave.co/3YeXrg9\r\n(Similar) Anthropologie Antique Brass Candlestick: https://fave.co/3YbTLMl\r\n(Similar) Etsy Bud Vase Trio: https://fave.co/3YhO2Vp\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nArtwork by: \r\nDaniella Busarello http://danielabusarello.com/\r\nNacho Carbonell https://www.nachocarbonell.com/ \r\nMichael Harnish https://www.instagram.com/michaelharnishh/?hl=en\r\nMitch Iburg http://www.mitchiburg.com/ \r\nValéria Nascimento https://www.valerianascimento.com/ \r\nJon Pilkington https://jonpilkington.co.uk/\r\nKour Pour https://www.kourpour.com/ IG: @kourpour\r\nDomingos Tótora https://www.domingostotora.com.br/ \r\nNina Walton https://www.ninawalton.com/ \r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks: \r\n\r\nJordan Daniels at Carpenters Workshop Gallery https://carpentersworkshopgallery.com/ \r\nMarina at Sage Culture Art Gallery https://sageculture.com/\r\nSarah Drake at the Simchowitz Gallery https://www.simchowitz.com\r\nStephanie Guerrero at Creative Art Partners https://www.creativeartpartners.com/\r\n\r\nDirector: Meg Sutton\r\nDirector of Photography: Grant Bell\r\nEditor: Alex Mechanik\r\nTalent : John Legend; Chrissy Teigen\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nLine Producer: Joe Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Josh Crowe\r\nProduction Manager: Peter Brunette\r\nProduction Coordinator: Kariesha Kidd\r\nTalent Booker: Dana Matthews\r\nCamera Operator: Josh Andersen\r\nAudio Engineer: Paul Cornett\r\nProduction Assistant: Jordan Crucchiola\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nAssistant Editor: Justin Symonds\n\nWant even more AD?

{"description":"Grounding is one of the most confusing and misunderstood aspects of the grid.\n🥑 For 50% off with HelloFresh PLUS free shipping, use code 50PRACTICAL at https://bit.ly/44zdZll!\n\nErrata:\nAt 10:40, the meter is set to resistance (not voltage). Since current is constant, it is also an indication of differences in voltage, but the script should have been a little clearer.\n\nCurrent doesn’t flow to the ground; it flows through the ground and back up. If there is electricity moving into the ground from an energized conductor, go back to the source of that conductor and see what’s happening. For the grid, it’s probably a transformer or electrical generator, in either case, a simple coil of wire. And, the electrical current flowing out of the coil has to be equal to the electrical current flowing into it, whether that current is coming from one of the other phases, a neutral line, or an electrode buried in the ground.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-where-does-grounded-electricity-actually-go?ref=practical-engineering\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

Funniest thing I’ve seen in a while\"\n0:54 The mechanic repaired the leak, redid the brake line then bled the brake system.\n1:10 Fuel tank needed to be replaced as the customer screwed multiple self-tappers into the fuel tank.\n1:20 As mentioned the customer tried to plug a USB-C cable into a regular USB port. \n1:36 The customer just recently bought this vehicle used and was not informed of the features that it had.\n1:46 The customer is going through their insurance company to get the repairs done.\n2:01 The customer towed a dump trailer that was too big/heavy for the truck they have. A 3/4 ton or 1 ton would have been better for the job. They are trying to get insurance to cover the damage.\n2:13 International with a Cummins Engine. The technician isn't quite sure what the driver put in the diesel exhaust tank to make it look like cheese. He thinks maybe they put diesel in the tank by accident or hydraulic fluid.\n2:22 \"Customer had \"engine work\" done at another local shop. Driving it home the car apparently filled with smoke and then quit running. She had a new battery installed and warranted it 3 times. It came to our shop and you couldn't even jump it. The battery-positive cable to the starter was shorted to the ground. Found there were only 3 of the 4 bolts holding the AC compressor in. Removed the compressor and found the reason why- the 4th bolt hole was blocked by the B+ cable sandwiched between the compressor and its bracket.\"\n2:39 2022 Dodge Ram 1500. The technician wasn't informed who/what shop apparently did this. So they think it might have been the customer.\nThe rear differential pinion melted since there was no gear oil in the differential.\n2:54 \"Plugged in the tester, but couldn't find anything valid.\nI suggested it was an electronic failure of a French car (I'm used to, that French cars could behave a little bit strange issues, sometimes). So I disconnected the battery, but the alarm was still going. Then I found the Alarm-clock. Me and my customer laughed.\"\n3:09 In the last photo you can see that the customer's \"friend\" installed the head gasket incorrectly as the part that says FRONT is supposed to be at the front of the engine.\n3:24 \"1974 Corvette 454, tko 500 5 speed Granatelli cutouts.\"\n3:35 Outro.

{"description":"Secret Invasion has the distinct honor of uniting the spectrum of Marvel fandom in a shared disdain for the latest MCU Disney Plus entry.  Pitched as a psychological spy thriller it lacked intrigue and suspense despite the stellar cast of Samuel L Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Olivia Colman, Martin Freeman and Cobie Smulders. Plus the finale was, you know, bad.
