{"description":"Kung Fu Panda 4 - In Theaters March 8\n\nThis spring, for the first time in almost a decade, comedy icon Jack Black returns to his role as Po, the world’s most unlikely kung fu master, with a hilarious, butt-kicking new chapter in DreamWorks Animation’s beloved action-comedy franchise: Kung Fu Panda 4. \n\nAfter three death-defying adventures defeating world-class villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills, Po, the Dragon Warrior (Golden Globe nominee Jack Black), is called upon by destiny to … give it a rest already. More specifically, he’s tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace.\n\nThat poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. \n\nEven worse, there’s been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (Oscar® winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Po’s Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. \n\nSo, Po’s going to need some help. He finds it (kinda?) in the form of crafty, quick-witted thief Zhen (Golden Globe winner Awkwafina), a corsac fox who really gets under Po’s fur but whose skills will prove invaluable. In their quest to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleon’s reptilian claws, this comedic odd-couple duo will have to work together. In the process, Po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places. \n\nThe film features the voice talent of returning stars Academy Award® winner Dustin Hoffman as Kung Fu master, Shifu; James Hong (Everything Everywhere All at Once) as Po’s adoptive father, Mr. Ping; Academy Award® nominee Bryan Cranston as Po’s birth father, Li, and Emmy Award nominee Ian McShane as Tai Lung, Shifu’s former student and arch-nemesis. Oscar® winner Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All at Once) joins the ensemble as a new character, Han, the leader of the Den of Thieves. \n \nKung Fu Panda 4 is directed by Mike Mitchell (DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls, Shrek Forever After) and produced by Rebecca Huntley (DreamWorks Animation’s The Bad Guys). The film’s co-director is Stephanie Ma Stine (She-Ra and the Princesses of Power). In 2008, the Academy Award®-nominated 2008 inaugural chapter, Kung Fu Panda, became DreamWorks Animation’s highest-grossing original animated film and launched a franchise that has earned more than $1.8 billion at the global box-office.\n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/kungfupanda \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kungfupanda \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.kungfupanda.com\n#KungFuPanda","title":"KUNG FU PANDA 4 | Official Trailer","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_inKs4eeHiI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_inKs4eeHiI/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4122339}}

{"description":"You are not prepared for what is to come. #DunePartTwo - Only in theaters March 1.\n\nThe saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast. The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”\n\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), Souheila Yacoub (“The Braves,” “Climax”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).\n\n“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.\n\nVilleneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel. The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick. The executive producers are Joshua Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.\n\nVilleneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West. Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.\n\nWarner Bros.

{"description":"Ashley Pointer | December 13, 2023\n\"I grew up playing classical music and it's so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamber-like setting,\" Laufey says in her performance. Accompanied by a string quartet, the singer-songwriter's modern jazz-pop love songs soared at the Tiny Desk, the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact.\n\nLaufey's music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger, mainstream audiences coming to the genre. Her sophomore album, Bewitched, broke Spotify's all-time streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platform's history and resulted in her first Grammy nomination. She opens the set with \"From The Start,\" a bouncy, whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend, connecting Chet Baker-like scats with charming and playful lyrics.

{"description":"Tom Sandoval, Ariana Madix, James Kennedy, Scheana Shay, Lala Kent and the rest of the cast gear up for season 11 of Vanderpump Rules. Watch the season premiere of Vanderpump Rules, January 30th at 8/7c on Bravo. \n\n►► SUBSCRIBE: http://bravo.ly/Subscribe\n►► WATCH FULL EPISODES NOW: https://bravo.app.link/Bravo-YT\n►► VISIT BRAVO’S OFFICIAL SITE: http://bravo.ly/Official\n#Bravo #PumpRules #SneakPeek #SeasonPremiere\n\nAbout Vanderpump Rules:\nAs a mentor and confidant to the group, Lisa is working to restore some peace between two feuding exes as she attempts to provide perspective. Lisa is refocusing her expertise on opening a new restaurant in Lake Tahoe and continuing her success with additional ventures in Las Vegas.   \n\nAriana’s life was turned upside down after a devastating breakup, but she’s determined to make the best of a difficult situation. Although she still shares a home with her ex, Ariana is moving on and dating a new long-distance boyfriend. While working to open the doors to her and Katie’s sandwich shop, Something About Her, Ariana is embracing the countless opportunities that have come her way.\n  \nRecently proclaimed #1 guy in the group, James’ friendships within the circle are stronger than ever and his DJ career is booming. He bought a house in the Valley and is settling into suburban life with his girlfriend, Ally Lewber, along with their cat and a dog from James’ past.\n  \nWith more distance from her divorce, Katie is exploring life as a single woman and dating, even if her pursuits strike too close to home for her ex-husband, Tom. A previous indiscretion comes to light and threatens to upend her and Scheana’s renewed friendship as well as her cordial post-divorce relationship with Tom.\n  \nLala is still in the midst of a challenging custody battle, but being the best mom to Ocean remains her priority. Lala explores fertility treatments and looks for a sperm donor as a single mother. She finds an unlikely connection with Tom Schwartz, forming a friendship that neither saw coming, but creating tension between her and the rest of the girls as her forgiveness for the Toms grows.\n  \nCelebrating their one-year wedding anniversary, Scheana and husband Brock are struggling to connect as they leave the honeymoon stage and settle into their life with a toddler. Scheana works on new music as a way to express herself. She finds herself straddling the lines in the sand within the group as she navigates her relationships with her longtime friends, and feuding exes, Ariana and Tom.\n  \nIn the aftermath of a scandal that changed his romantic relationships, dynamics within the group and the success of his businesses, Sandoval is working on bettering himself. In a fragile state, he focuses on repairing the foundations of his friendships. When he isn’t on the road touring with his band, Tom Sandoval and the Most Extras, he and Ariana live under the same roof ... locked in a stalemate for the house.\n  \nTom is mending a challenged friendship after taking the heat for his part in his best friend’s shocking deception. Embracing a new identity, Tom bleaches his hair, evades exclusivity with a friend-potentially-turned-girlfriend, and winds up in a surprising love triangle with a new flame and his ex-wife.\n\nCast:\nLisa Vanderpump\nAriana Madix\nJames Kennedy\nKatie Maloney\nLala Kent\nScheana Shay\nTom Schwartz\nTom Sandoval\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Splash Day for our New HH44 Catamaran\n01:08 How New Boats go from Land to Sea\n03:27 STOP!

{"description":"In November of 2022, Ken Block and the Hoonigan team headed to Mexico City, MX to film the next installment of the Electrikhana series with the Audi S1 Hoonitron.

{"description":"Welcome to the ULTIMATE petrol vs electric drag race! \n\nWe’ve got our hands on the all-new Tesla Cybertruck, and it’s lining up alongside the a Lamborghini Urus! But which will come out on top - petrol, or electric? \n\nWell, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. It also has a top speed of 130mph. \n\nThen we have the Lambo. It’s packing a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet, and this can produce 650hp and 850Nm of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-speed torque converter gearbox, and it’s a whole lot lighter than the Tesla, tipping the scales at 2,200kg. It also has a much bigger top speed, coming in at 190mph. \n\nSo the Cybertruck has the Urus beat when it comes to performance stats, but will the extra weight drag it down? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!","title":"Tesla Cybertruck v Lamborghini Urus: DRAG RACE","duration":618,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20231206","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl-wz50yAHo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fl-wz50yAHo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGGEgYShhMA8=&rs=AOn4CLDkxOa5KH6_Q7BI9oV5e0241G7MTQ","content":{"View count":5138115}}
