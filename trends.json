To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMB01VDG34ZD46WY","title":"We have a small problem...","duration":1846,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20230604","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesQzx5tJnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/VesQzx5tJnE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":154013}}

{"description":"Check out the best shots of the day from round 4 of the 2023 Memorial Tournament presented by Workday, featuring Jon Rahm, Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland, who defeated Denny McCarthy in a one-hole playoff for his fourth victory of his PGA TOUR career.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PGA TOUR heads to Ohio for the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday, a Designated event at Muirfield Village Golf Club. Hosted by 18-time major champion Jack Nicklaus, it is one of the PGA TOUR’s longest-running events at the same venue, having debuted at Muirfield Village in 1976. Billy Horschel returns this week to defend his title from 2022. His four-stroke victory marked his seventh PGA TOUR win last time out. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler also heads to Muirfield Village after finishing tied for third in last week’s Charles Schwab Challenge. He finished just one stroke outside of the Emiliano Grillo and Adam Schenk playoff. Grillo and Schenk will also be competing this week, looking to bring their hot hands to the Memorial Tournament. FedExCup Standings leader Jon Rahm and world No. 3 Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up at Muirfield Village. Rahm won the tournament in 2020 by three strokes. Two-time tournament champion Patrick Cantlay heads back to Ohio aiming to get a third win under his belt, and his close friend Xander Schauffele will aim to grab his first title here after four top-20 finishes in five starts at the Memorial Tournament. Jordan Spieth, Viktor Hovland, Matt Fitzpatrick and Justin Thomas will also look for their first wins at Nicklaus’ signature event.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Highlights | Round 4 | the Memorial | 2023","duration":699,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20230604","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRPpay6bpHs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eRPpay6bpHs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":307882}}
{"description":"Go to https://squarespace.com/vanwives to get a free trial and 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain \n\nWelcome back, Pack! With our never-ending renovations, improvements and gardening we've been doing this spring, we've decided to give our tired and sore backs some help by tag-teaming in a legend in the world of gardening: THE TRACTOR! A 2012 Kubota B26, bright orange tractor with 1800 hours on it to be precise 🤠 That's right, through a twist of fate and a bit of good fortune, we were able to get one recently and it's beautiful. And we need YOUR help in naming it! Please comment your names below! 👇 But first we have to learn how to drive it, use the bucket, backhoe and forklift. This thing turns on a dime, lifts giant payloads with ease, and is generally so much fun to drive that maybe we're going to become the TractorWives?! Okay maybe not just yet, but we're in love with this tractor. Maybe we can even start a new landscaping side-hustle: C&J's Landscaping! Has a nice ring to it, eh? No more walking on sharp rocks, breaking our backs lifting for hours a day. The backhoe mode is kind of the opposite of the lifter mode, and after some trial and error, we were able to plant our first cedar tree with it. For anyone who's never operated a tractor before, it's almost like playing a video game like Smash Brothers, where your button inputs suddenly become backwards. We're so happy! We also checked in on our little seedlings in our green house and are so excited to show you how much they've grown already 🌞 And we're finally creating a pathway for our fruit garden. We can't wait to see what new projects we can complete with our new tractor friend.

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.\n\nSubscribe to DisneyMusicVEVO 🔔 for all the latest Disney music videos: https://www.youtube.com/@DisneyMusicVEVO?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Disney Music: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic\n\nMusic video by Awkwafina, Daveed Diggs performing The Scuttlebutt (From \"The Little Mermaid\"). © 2023 Walt Disney Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/cwVndj","title":"Awkwafina, Daveed Diggs - The Scuttlebutt (From \"The Little Mermaid\")","duration":129,"channel_id":"UCgwv23FVv3lqh567yagXfNg","author":"DisneyMusicVEVO","date":"20230601","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4ovRhX8XIM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4ovRhX8XIM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":941996}}

The area had a large fallen tree in it that I burnt into 3 pieces and rolled out of the way with logs as levers. I may build a hut in this area and so cleared it.\nNext, I dug a pit to mix clay in and collected the new source of clay. The old brick mold (made in a previous video) was used to make 50 bricks that were then allowed to dry. \nWhile this was happening I dismantled the old kiln and used its bricks to make a new one. The new configuration uses only 74 bricks instead of the previous 100, a significantly simpler design. Its firebox is formed by crisscrossing 2 layers of bricks so that air enters in the first layer channels and wood enters the 2nd layer channels at right angles to the first. The new kiln has 3 firing holes instead of the previous 2 of the last design. The new design also has all the bricks stacked on their sides so there is less chance of breakage.\nI fired the bricks and the kiln went ok. There were some cold spots at the top but this may be due to the fact I used less wood than usual, with the firing only taking 2.5 hours (ran out of wood). 3 hours would be better and more wood should be collected beforehand ( a 75x75x100cm pile as opposed to 75x75x75cm pile used this time). The bricks in the coldest area still passed a water test without dissolving though, so it was a success.\nAsh from the firring was made into bricks for storage as they can be used for mortar by calcining (firing in the kiln) later and mixing with sand and water.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #BrickKiln #Kiln","title":"Primitive Technology: New Brick Kiln Design","duration":835,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230602","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SH4irC_xMs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7SH4irC_xMs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1220779}}
