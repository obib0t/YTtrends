{"description":"Up in the sky, that's a rocket arcing over the sky in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. And see that explosion? That's the iron dome missile defense system in action.. Intercepting and eliminating the projectile.\n\nIt might seem like not much more than a blip in the sky, but take a look at the view at night. Each of those explosions is right here. A thwarted rocket attack.\n\nThe Israeli company that developed the iron dome system says the system has destroyed thousands of unguided rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon into Israel since 2011.\n\nBut the iron dome isn't really a dome. Though it's meant to create a force field effect. They're movable batteries, attached to missile launchers that look like this.\n\nAnd here's how it works - so first, its radar senses a rocket when it's getting close. Anywhere from 2.5 to 43 miles away. According to Raytheon - a U.S. defense contractor that helps produce them. Then, the iron dome's control center kicks into gear - and quickly analyzes whether a rocket will hit populated areas. If it determines the rocket will hit a town or a city, the system will tell a launcher to shoot off a missile that will intercept and destroy it mid-air. The fragments of metal and debris then fall to the ground.\n\nThe Israeli defense forces reported that it intercepted more than 95 percent of rockets during an operation last May. Over the last few days, the Israeli military says 4,500 rockets were fired from Gaza, and the Iron Dome has intercepted many.\n\n===================\n\nWCNC Charlotte considers multiple perspectives and provides diverse points of view.

And I've learned even more about the game since the last one.  But more then that, the game has improved a ton, too!   In this Cities Skylines 2 gameplay video, we'll continue to build Moundsville, which  is a city inspired by a real master plan; however, in this episode, Moundsville completely outgrows its plans as we add a ton of density.\n\nBut beyond just adding density, we'll also build some of the grittier parts of the city, including cargo rail and passenger rail infrastructure, a garbage incineration plant, a new solar power plant and battery backup, all of the specialized industries, and MASSIVE suburban expansions.  By the end, we'll add a ton of skyscrapers to the city.  \n\nStick around until after the tour when I'll give you my completely unvarnished views on the game.\n\nFYI - this is not a sponsored video, but I want to give a huge shout out to  @paradoxinteractive  and the  @CitiesSkylines  team for providing me early access to the game!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS VIDEOS IN SERIES\n\n►  First CS2 video: https://youtu.be/xm2yD9mXgPQ\n► Seconds CS2 video: https://youtu.be/g9yESIzeyQ0\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFIND ME HERE\n\n► Website: http://CityPlannerPlays.com \n► Discord:  https://discord.gg/CityPlannerPlays\n► Twitter:  https://twitter.com/cityplanneryt\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE CHANNEL, GET COOL PERKS!\n\n► Merch Store:  https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Store\n► Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CityPlannerPlays\n► YT Membership: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/YTMembership\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMY MUSIC\n\n► Master Planned Music: Http://MasterPlannedMusic.com\n► Epidemic Sound: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Epidemic\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMY GEAR\n\n► Kit.co Link  https://kit.co/cityplannerplays\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLAYLISTS\n\n► Ultimate Beginners Guide: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/BeginnersGuide\n► Cities Skylines II: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/CS2\n► Tutorials: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Tutorials\n► Nicolet Bay: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/NicoletBay\n► Verde Beach: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/VerdeBeach\n► Clearwater County: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/ClearwaterCounty\n► Abandoned City Fix: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/AbandonedCity\n► Sustainable City: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/SustainableCity\n► Bluffside Crossing: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Bluffside\n► City Tips: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/CityTips\n► Previous Live Streams: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Streams\n► Timberborn: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Timberborn\n► Other Games: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/OtherGames\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHASHTAGS\n\n#CitiesSkylines2 #cityplannerplays\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHAPTERS\n\nSeries Recap and Off Camera Fixes! - 0:00\nI'm the Trash Man! - 2:37\nALL of the Rail - 6:04\nThe Suburbs - 17:46\nSolar - 32:01\nSpecialized Industry - 37:04\nIncreasing Density - 46:34\nCity Tour - 53:52\nHow I feel about the game after 143 hours - 55:30","title":"After 143 hours playing Cities Skylines 2, I built THIS city and have a few thoughts...","duration":3598,"channel_id":"UC8WAaaW2FnctRI9coYJoUdA","author":"City Planner Plays","date":"20231011","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P21vSG4Adwc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P21vSG4Adwc/hqdefault.jpg?v=65265560","content":{"View count":322030}}

{"description":"Back to where it all started! Five years ago, I rented a Royal Enfield Himalayan in Manali, India and rode it around the Himalayan mountains for a couple of weeks. I loved it so much, that I bought one in Delhi, named it Basanti and rode it half across the world. Now, I am back in the Himalayas, but this time, on the NEW Himalayan, a bike that is not yet launched. I got the incredible opportunity to try this pre-production bike out, and this time, I have my cameras to record these adventures in India.

{"description":"The 2024 Lamborghini Revuelto is the company’s first high-performance hybrid supercar. Powered by a roaring V12 with an absurdly high 9500 rpm redline and three electric motors, the Revuelto makes over 1000 horsepower combined. All of this explosive and electric power is connected by a transversal dual clutch e-gearbox, which aids in achieving Lamborghini’s claimed 0-100 kmh time of just 2.5 seconds. But performance aside, does a hybrid Lamborghini still feel like a Lamborghini? And how is it on the track? Thomas is off to Italy to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling!

{"description":"Gabriel Martinelli’s late deflected strike gave us a huge win against Champions Manchester City at Emirates Stadium.\n\nIn a game with little goalmouth action throughout, it was left to substitute Martinelli – on his first appearance since the middle of September – to score the only goal of the game, and move us above Pep Guardiola’s men in the table.\n\nIt ended a run of 12 consecutive defeats against City, and it’s a victory that could yet prove significant come the end of the season.\n\nAs usual, the atmosphere inside Emirates Stadium was electric at kick off. Both sides knew top spot in the Premier League was up for grabs.\n\nIt was the visitors who had the first sight of goal. From their first corner of the afternoon, Josko Gvardiol hooked goalwards, but Declan Rice was well placed to head off the line. The danger was not cleared though, until Nathan Ake blazed over when the ball fell to him inside the area.\n\nIt was a big let off early on, and there was another on the quarter hour. We were playing the ball around at the back, but David Raya spent just too long in possession, Julian Alvarez closed him down and the keeper’s attempted clearance clattered against the Argentine and just wide of his own post.\n\nWe needed to get into the game, and Eddie Nketiah did well to work a shooting opportunity inside the area, but flashed his effort wide.\n\nWe began to come back into the game, the intensity increased and there was a flashpoint when Mateo Kovacic dived in late on Martin Odegaard. He was only shown a yellow card, despite a VAR review.\n\nWithin minutes the Croatian then fouled Declan Rice with a similar lunge, but to the amazement of the Emirates faithful, the referee kept his cards in his pocket.\n\nWe were having our best spell of the half, and Alex Zinchenko had two speculative shots from the edge of the area blocked.\n\nMikel Arteta introduced Gabriel Martinelli for the second half, the Brazilian returning to action after missing the last five games with injury.\n\nHe took up his usual position on the left, replacing Leandro Trossard, with Gabriel Jesus on the opposite flank. After a run of 87 consecutive appearances in the Premier League, Bukayo Saka was not involved at all.\n\nMartinelli struck our first shot on target five minutes after coming on. He was set up by Declan Rice, but the angle was always against him.\n\nThe pace of the game began to drop, and chances were scarce for either side. As we entered the final 15 minutes, Arteta made a triple change, bringing on Kai Havertz, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Thomas Partey.\n\nThree of the four subs combined for the goal.\n\nTomiyasu laid off a long pass to Havertz just inside the area, who in turn passed back to Martinelli. His shot was on target, but completely wrong-footed Ederson when it smashed off Nathan Ake’s face.\n\nThe Emirates erupted. We had barely been troubled at the back, but now we had a lead to see out.\n\nWe managed it without much cause for alarm, to extend our unbeaten start in the Premier League, and finally get one over last season’s treble-winners.\n\n#arsenal \n\n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"The Grant: https://forms.gle/HBtAdt7zedrtzbZ48\nPizzamas: https://pizzamas.com/discount/HANKSENTME\n\nAs I upload this, I am realizing that there is a pretty huge part of my life that I barely ever talk about publicly. I mean, that is also somewhat true of family things, but business isn't traditionally seen as a thing to be private about. There are lots of people who have big, full careers just talking about the business of their business. I myself have felt the pull to create that kind of content and have done it!\n\nBut I stopped a while back as I realized that talking about the inside operations of my business was always sharing other people's stories as well as my own, and that's weird without asking for permission. Plus, my perception of a situation is never going to be exactly the same as someone else's. So I stopped doing it. I even put a little sign on my computer that says \"DON'T TWEET ABOUT WORK\" to remind me. Even this video felt like it was on the edge of sharing too much, though it is almost all about me. \n\nI feel like there's a relationship between the \"I tweet about what a good boss I am boss\" and the \"wife guy.\" And we've seen times when those bosses hve proved that they are not great bosses. I am also not a great boss...I know that there are some out there, but it's not an easy thing to do. It's especially hard when you have both the inclination and opportunity to be constantly distracted by other things!\n\nSo yeah, that's why I don't talk about the biggest part of my professional life on the internet. If my businesses were just my business, I would, but it's not. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com","title":"I Quit","duration":576,"channel_id":"UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA","author":"vlogbrothers","date":"20231006","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjz3lGV6Tuw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jjz3lGV6Tuw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":642690}}

{"description":"Night Swim\nComing Soon to Theaters\n\nNo running. No diving. No lifeguard on duty. No swimming after dark. \n\nAtomic Monster and Blumhouse, the producers of M3GAN, high dive into the deep end of horror with the new supernatural thriller, Night Swim. \n\nBased on the acclaimed 2014 short film by Rod Blackhurst and Bryce McGuire, the film stars Wyatt Russell (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) as Ray Waller, a former major league baseball player forced into early retirement by a degenerative illness, who moves into a new home with his concerned wife Eve (Oscar® nominee Kerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin), teenage daughter Izzy (Amélie Hoeferle, this fall’s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes) and young son Elliot (Gavin Warren, Fear the Walking Dead). \n\nSecretly hoping, against the odds, to return to pro ball, Ray persuades Eve that the new home’s shimmering backyard swimming pool will be fun for the kids and provide physical therapy for him. But a dark secret in the home’s past will unleash a malevolent force that will drag the family under, into the depths of inescapable terror. \n\nNight Swim is written and directed by Bryce McGuire (writer of the upcoming film Baghead) and is produced by James Wan, the filmmaker behind the Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring franchises, and Jason Blum, the producer of the Halloween films, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man. The film is executive produced by Michael Clear and Judson Scott for Wan’s Atomic Monster and by Ryan Turek for Blum’s Blumhouse.\n\nSocial Pages:\n\nFacebook: Facebook.com/nightswimmovie\n\nInstagram: Instagram.com/nightswimmovie\n\nX: x.com/nightswimmovie","title":"Night Swim | Official Trailer","duration":117,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231005","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSNqteCEtE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/pcSNqteCEtE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":10322814}}

To make and fire bricks, a workspace protected from the rain must be made to protect the bricks from dissolving before they are fired. Built in a previous video, the hut was used as a space to fire the bricks. The firing went well with no issues with the thatch catching fire due to the height of the roof above the kiln.\nIn addition to the hut being a place to make bricks, I made a charcoal mound in the space left over to make charcoal, a fuel for smelting iron. I had a previous charcoal mound out in the weather but the rain was an issue keeping the wood damp before getting a chance to fire it. So I made a 75 cm diameter re-useable charcoal mound and it produced 6 and a half pots of charcoal. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #brickmaking  #charcoal","title":"Primitive Technology: Brick and Charcoal Production","duration":1129,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20231005","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjBTKe8Y44c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PjBTKe8Y44c/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":941559}}
