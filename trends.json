{"description":"Long Live the Fighters. #DunePartTwo only in theaters November 3.\n\n-----------------\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dune\nhttps://twitter.com/dunemovie \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@dunemovie \n-----------------\nThe saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast.  The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).\n“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. \nVilleneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel.  The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick.  The executive producers are Josh Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.\nVilleneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West.  Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.\n“Dune: Part Two” was filmed on location in Budapest, Abu Dhabi, Jordan and Italy.  The film is slated for a November 3, 2023 worldwide release from Warner Bros. Pictures.","title":"Dune: Part Two | Official Trailer","duration":144,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

{"description":"The 2023 MET Gala has come and gone, and well I wish it had gone rather faster, considering the lack of care or interest most of the celebrities put into it. The MET Gala exhibit “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” was celebrated with a red carpet attended by the world of celebrity and fashion’s elite. But the theme of the red carpet “In honor of Karl” was certainly followed loosely. Celebrities arrived wearing poor imitations of Karl Lagerfeld’s work at Chanel, while neglecting his work at Fendi, Patou, Balmain, and Chloé so severely it was almost sickening. What was supposed to be an exciting and easy theme to follow, was obviously just too hard. \n\nMET Gala 2023 Karl Lagerfeld Theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrFvY8KczIM\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:09 Anna Wintour & Bill Nighy - Chanel\n2:25 Anne Hathaway - Versace\n3:49 Bad Bunny - Jacquemus\n5:13 Billie Eilish - Simone Rocha\n6:55 Cardi B - Chen Peng\n8:26 Doja Cat - Oscar de la Renta\n10:36 Dua Lipa - Chanel\n12:42 Emma Chamberlain - Miu Miu\n14:03 Gigi Hadid - Givenchy\n15:10 Ice Spice - Balmain \n17:00 Janelle Monae - Thom Browne\n18:49 Jared Leto\n18:55 Jenna Ortega - Thom Browne\n20:43 Jennie Kim - Chanel\n22:34 Kendall Jenner - Marc Jacobs\n23:39 Kim Kardashian - Schiaparelli\n25:13 Kylie Jenner - Jean Paul Gaultier by Haider Ackermann\n26:13 Lil Nas X - Pat McGrath\n27:45 Lizzo - Chanel\n28:51 Margot Robbie - Chanel\n29:50 Michaela Coel - Schiaparelli\n32:02 Nicole Kidman - Chanel\n33:16 Rihanna & A$AP Rocky\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join\n\nSocial Media:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/\nPersonal Style: https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hautelemode\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess\n\nFor business inquiries please contact: hautelemode@whalartalent.com\n\nVideo Edited by:\nRachel Fritz: https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/","title":"MET GALA 2023 FASHION ROAST (this was the worst one yet)","duration":2178,"channel_id":"UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw","author":"HauteLeMode","date":"20230502","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WcvAiKQfI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E_WcvAiKQfI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGGUgSyhHMA8=&rs=AOn4CLDysNGyCl7ZW6_ayjXyo082ihxJ_Q","content":{"View count":493478}}

{"description":"The Met Gala 2023 was fashion's biggest night, and it brought out the best in celebrities. In this OSSA'm video, we'll be exploring all of the Met Gala’s 2023 must-see looks and biggest moments!\n\nIn today's OSSA'm video, you will learn that this year's theme was \"\"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\"\" and celebrities paid homage to the legendary designer. Most celebrities followed Karl's dress code, wearing black and white gowns. Florence Pugh, Olivia Rodrigo, and Jenna Ortega perfectly combined these colors. Celebrities also had fun imitating Karl's favorite cat, Choupette. Jared Leto even brought a giant copy of the cat's head with him. Doja Cat and Lil Nas X took their cat look further. Lil Nas X covered his body with nothing but a thong and a silver tint, while Doja Cat completed her Oscar de la Renta hooded gown with cat ears on the hood. Rihanna made a bold statement, arriving covered with iconic Chanel camellia flowers from head to toe. Cardi B also wore a stunning white dress but later changed to a pink gown that didn't match the dress code of the event. There were also examples of chic and elegance at the event, with Pedro Pascal and Pete Davidson paying tribute to Chanel in their looks. Kim Kardashian arrived at the Met Gala dripping in precious gems, wearing a dress made from 50,000 pearls and 16,000 crystals. Her ex-boyfriend, Pete Davidson, posed on the red carpet alone this time, but they reunited inside for a sweet talk. Meanwhile, Serena Williams announced her second pregnancy at the event.\n\nOverall, the Met Gala 2023 was a night of surprises, and it showcased some of the most memorable fashion moments in recent history.

Today The Spiffing Brit is playing the game to see if age of wonders 4 is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits! Although spoilers he finds 4 exploits in the game and will be covering all of them for you today. From farming pantheon points, unlimited gold and free trade deals to just printing units by instantly transferring provinces. \n\nYou can check out AOW 4 here: https://play.ageofwonders.com/SpiffingBrit\n\nThis video is going to be packed with funny clips in a montage style of british humor!

{"description":"GRAB THE LIMITED GN15 ANNIVERSARY FOIL SHIRT! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/limited-edition-foil-gn15-tshirt-design | Grab one of the brand new, LIMITED EDITION FOIL 'GN15' shirts to help out while getting something commemorative for 15 years of GamersNexus in return! This research piece took us a straight week of nonstop work to complete. We're beyond excited to have worked on this -- it's exactly what we love doing here. \n\nThis video benchmarks and tests various points of failure for the AMD X3D CPUs in particular, but also just generally AM5 / Ryzen 7000 (Zen 4) CPU failures. The most eye-catching failure mode is catastrophic: Users have posted photos of exploded CPUs with blown-out motherboard sockets and melted plastic. We bought those parts from the users to perform a failure analysis, then set forth testing our own AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPUs to see if we could make them explode. Spoiler alert: It worked. We were able to melt new AMD X3D CPUs in the socket of an ASUS X670E Crosshair Hero motherboard, but we also found severe BIOS bugs in Gigabyte's BIOS. SOC voltage isn't the only concern, here. It's also poor OCP implementation on at least the ASUS board we used, plus a combination of the erosion of thermal and over-current protections. As stated in the video, no test of this type is fully conclusive: These are complex issues with functionally infinite variables between users (and possible error), manufacturers, BIOS versions, and AMD itself. As such, we can only speak to our findings in some instances -- but we have some that do point to specific issues.\n\nWe killed 2x 7800X3Ds and 1x ASUS motherboard, but we also had 2 failed CPUs and 1 failed board from viewers.\n\nWe will have at least 1 more part following this video up. We've sent parts out to the same failure analysis lab we worked with in our NVIDIA 12VHPWR content - it'll take a few weeks to put together.\n\nBig thanks to Wendell at @Level1Techs - check out his channel!\nThanks to @der8auer for his guidance on delidding safely!\nCheck out Elmor's super cool utilities: https://elmorlabs.com/\n\r\nWatch our last failure analysis video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig2px7ofKhQ\n\nLike our content?

{"description":"A day in the life at a Japanese Bakery in Tokyo Japan. This is the working life of a typical Japanese baker and their Japan work culture.  We follow the Japan baker during their work hours as well as the morning routine and after work life.  Japanese bakeries are known for their unique variety of bread products quite different to their western counterparts, with items such as melon pan, an pan and all kinds of sozai breads. And although rice is a Japanese staple, bread gained in popularity during the meiji period, and in less than 2 centuries, it’s become even more popular than rice.  Soft Japanese bread with all sorts of cream and curry fillings, mentaiko and yakisoba toppings is all perfectly suited for the local taste.  In Japan, food safety is paramount to showcasing and serving delectable breads.  And with Japanese customers equally conscious about cleanliness, it's almost culturally mandatory for breads to be individually wrapped assuring customers that each piece of bread has been properly handled and no else has touched it. Shokupan is a Japanese milk bread, popular for its milky-sweet taste, undeniable moistness and pillowy cottoncandy like softness often served as breakfast toast or sandwich bread.  Different than traditional white bread, it has a richer flavorful experience. The Yudane baking method which originated in Japan is used here.  Instead of being cooked, the flour is mixed with boiled water then left to cool down before use, which gelatinizes the starch in the flour resulting in a more tender bread which stays softer for longer. \n\nAripan Bakery\nLocation - https://goo.gl/maps/occ511AarD1xnb7y8\nIG - @arina_de_panaderia, @arinasuda67\n- https://instagram.com/arina_de_panaderia\n- https://instagram.com/arinasuda67\n\nWatch more of my Japan Day in the Life videos:\n- https://tokyozebra.com/ditl\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n___ Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ___\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?
