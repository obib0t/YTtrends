Since they'd have to be at least 25 years old to qualify for importation, the guys would have to choose cars from the greatest decade - the '90s.  Tyler brought a heavily modified BMW E30 325i hot rod from Lebanon, Freddy lets his JDM freak flag fly with an inappropriate Mazda RX-7, and Ed outdoes himself and shows up in the most offensive TVR Cerbera ever made. They are then told to meet at the Freedom Factory for a race.

The prison consisted of four large plots where players could build, long hallways with cells and bathrooms, a cafeteria, an infirmary, and the Warden's Tower.\nSome prisoners grouped up to cause trouble, while others remained peaceful.

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #travel #travelvlog #alcatraz \n\n0:00 Our biggest fear\n0:50 Why are we doing this?!\n3:41 Seeing Alcatraz for the first time\n4:19 INSIDE Alcatraz (prison tour)\n5:50 What we are wearing to swim\n7:29 BEST VPN\n8:35 MORNING OF THE SWIM\n12:42 JUMPING IN the San Francisco Bay\n19:19 Our final thoughts on the swim","title":"WE ATTEMPTED THE DEADLY SWIM (Alcatraz to San Francisco)","duration":1410,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220528","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6H4dLs9kGU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M6H4dLs9kGU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":952228}}

{"description":"Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 - NEW TRAILER 2022 | NetPro's Concept Version\n\nThis trailer is a concept-mashup that shows my idea of ​​how the teaser trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 might look like.       \n____________________________________________\n◖Made/Edited By NetPro ◗\n▻ netfl.pro192@gmail.com\n____________________________________________\n\n◅ On our channel we create а trailer mashups ▻\nalso known as recut trailers, involve collecting multiple pieces of film footage from one or multiple movies and editing them to create a new trailer. Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.\n\nThere is no intention of infringing on anyone's intellectual property. This is not intended to deceive or defraud anyone; rather, it is intended to give fans a taste of what the film may be like. I don't own the material; I simply produce trailers for fans and others who are excited about a movie.\n\nThe trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.\n____________________________________________\n\nAbout Poppy Playtime:\n\nA survival horror video game with puzzle elements, developed and published by indie developer MOB Games. It was released on Steam for Windows on October 12, 2021. The game tells the story of a former employee who visits an abandoned factory of children's toys, formerly owned by the gaming company Playtime Co., 10 years after its employees disappeared without a trace.","title":"Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 - NEW TRAILER 2022 | NetPro's Concept Version","duration":59,"channel_id":"UCgLKyuJH2kaZX5sIJLKZ_aQ","author":"NetPro","date":"20220528","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7PsjG_cUFs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l7PsjG_cUFs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":3703130}}

{"description":"The beginning of the episode started with a recap of the prequels, ending with yoda’s line to him at the end of revenge of the sith where he tells Obi-Wan he has training for him, to teach him to commune with his old master qui-gon. So I think for sure we’ll see or hear Qui-Gon Jinn’s force ghost once again.\n\nWe start on coruscant, at the jedi temple where the younglings are being trained by a jedi master, as two 501st clones rush in to execute order 66. As she does her best to protect the younglings, she gets defeated and we see one of the younglings centred. I believe this could be a young Reva. She was a Jedi as the grand inquisitor states. We hear palpatine continuously say execute order 66 as see them running away while the temple is under attack as we saw in revenge of the sith.\n\nTransitioning to Tatooine, we see the Inquisitors land down and interrogate a cantina for the location of a Jedi hiding there. Reva uses tactics to snuff him out \nthat are very heaty in the eyes of the Grand Inquisitor, we have to remember that the senate is still a thing at this time, and isn’t disbanded quite yet. So Palpatine still doesn’t has as much free reign as he does in the original trilogy with blowing up alderaan and doing whatever he pleases whenever. The Jedi gets away and the Grand Inquisitor tells Reva he’s had enough of her wreckless behaviour and her fixation on Kenobi, that he’s not hers to find. He’s Vader’s, are my thoughts. I think she hates Kenobi so much for failing Anakin, but I could be wrong. \nWe finally meet up with Kenobi cutting sushi in the middle of the desert, making a living for himself as a regular man. Getting back to his Eopie, which could be the same one from revenge of the sith, he feeds it and heads back home. Heading to his cave, makes himself at home when he’s visited by a Jawa named TEEKA who hands Kenobi a toy ship, a lambda t4a imperial shuttle for Luke. \nWhen Teeka shows him a belt of the Jedi we just saw, telling Obi-Wan that a Jedi ran through the dune sea inquisitors after him and all and Obi-Wan says the Jedi are all extinct, now he knows that a jedi is here and the inquisitors are aware. This makes his job more difficult to protect Luke. He has to be on a higher alert now and keep watch of the boy more than usual.\n\nAs he goes to sleep, he has ptsd of Anakin and what happened to him. This is 10 years after the events of revenge of the sith, which means his ptsd was probably even worse in the years prior. He tries to reach out to qui-gon, and this isn’t the first time. The beginning of the episode started with a recap of the prequels, ending with yoda’s line to him at the end of revenge of the sith where he tells Obi-Wan he has training for him, to teach him to commune with his old master qui-gon. So to me, I think obi-wan hasn’t spoken to qui-gon yet. He;s trying, but he isn’t connecting himself to the force, he can’t. If he does, the empire will detect him. and Sniff him out like a dog to food.\n\nObi-Wan watches over Luke as he runs from Owen, much like Anakin, playful and rebellious.\n\nThrough the desert, Obi-Wan is found by Navi, the Jedi the inquisitors were after. He has a short interaction with Obi-Wan who pretends he’s not the famous Jedi Master. He finally breaks and tells the boy to forget the Jedi and let it go. To bury his lightsaber in the sand. Kenobi is a broken man. He’s hurting and he’s no longer the same hopeful man he used to be. I believe the point is to show a broken obi-wan turning into the hopeful alec guiness obi-wan we see later.\n\nOn Alderaan we meet with Leia. This is the best casting of a young Leia I’ve ever seen. I think she played the role so well. She portrays Leia’s rebellious, know it all personality while being adorable at the same time. Playing tricks on her mother and running off into the forest to explore.\n\nObi-Wan’s mundane life repeats itself and it seems like it’s really taken the wind from his sails. Heading back to his Eopie, Uncle Owen throws the toy he left for Luke onto the ground and tells Kenobi to leave them alone. Owen doesn’t like Obi-Wan for many reasons. One being that he blames Kenobi for the fall of Anakin and turn into Darth Vader, and the overall state of the galaxy. He also doesn’t like how Obi-Wan is always watching over Luke, he thinks it’ll eventually tip someone off and it’ll get them hurt all because of obi-wan snooping around and keeping watch.\n\nObi-Wan asks if Luke is ok, and owen says you don’t care if he’s ok you care if he’s showing. He means showing signs of the force. Meaning Owen thinks Kenobi only uses Luke to push him to be a Jedi like Anakin, and that didn’t turn out well.\n\nContinued in video...\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join\n\nContinue the conversation on the Theory forums!\nhttps://starwarstheory.com/THEORY/posts\n\nBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory","title":"Obi-Wan Kenobi Episode 1 BREAKDOWN","duration":857,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20220527","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScLHffxXkkE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ScLHffxXkkE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":790635}}

{"description":"Beast - Only In Theaters August 19\n\nSometimes the rustle in the bushes actually is a monster.\n\nIdris Elba (Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, The Suicide Squad) stars in a pulse-pounding new thriller about a father and his two teenage daughters who find themselves hunted by a massive rogue lion intent on proving that the savannah has but one apex predator.  \n\nElba plays Dr. Nate Daniels, a recently widowed husband who returns to South Africa, where he first met his wife, on a long-planned trip with their daughters to a game reserve managed by Martin Battles (Sharlto Copley, Russian Doll series, Maleficent), an old family friend and wildlife biologist. But what begins as a journey of healing jolts into a fearsome fight for survival when a lion, a survivor of blood-thirsty poachers who now sees all humans as the enemy, begins stalking them. \n\nIyana Halley (The Hate U Give, This is Us series) plays Daniels’ 18-year-old daughter, Meredith, and Leah Sava Jeffries (Rel series, Empire series) plays his 13-year-old, Norah.  \n\nFrom visceral, experiential filmmaker Baltasar Kormákur, the director of Everest and Universal Pictures’ 2 Guns and Contraband, Beast is produced by Will Packer, the blockbuster producer of Girls Trip, the Ride Along franchise, and ten movies that have opened No. 1 at the U.S. box office, including Night School, No Good Deed and Think Like a Man, by James Lopez, president of Will Packer Productions, and by Baltasar Kormákur. The film is written by Ryan Engle (Rampage, Non-Stop) from an original story by Jaime Primak Sullivan and is executive produced by Jaime Primak Sullivan and Bernard Bellew.\n\nSocial Handles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/beastmovie_official/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/beastmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BeastMovie/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics \nWebsite: https://www.beastmovie.com \n#BeastMovie","title":"Beast | Official Trailer","duration":151,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20220525","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQMc7Sq36mI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oQMc7Sq36mI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":9861082}}
