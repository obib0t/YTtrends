{"description":"Stephen Thompson | August 15, 2023\nThe Tiny Desk has hosted plenty of major pop, rock and hip-hop stars in its 15-plus years, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one more agreeable or self-effacing than Austin Richard Post. Whether lamenting the state of his singing voice, joking about his nerves or sitting slack-jawed in awe of the fantastic band his people had assembled for this show, Post had the bearing of a lottery winner who wouldn't even give himself credit for buying a ticket.\n\nBefore, during and after the show, Post Malone was a joy to have around. But he also just happened to bring a few of the biggest pop hits of the 21st century: Set-opener \"Sunflower,\" for example, has been certified eighteen-times platinum by the RIAA since its release in 2018 ‚Äî that's an all-time record ‚Äî while the 2017 single \"I Fall Apart\" and 2019's \"Circles\" lag behind at a mere ten-times platinum apiece. \"Enough Is Enough,\" which closes this set, enjoys no such designation, but give it time: A track from Post Malone's new album Austin, it's only been out for a few weeks.\n\nSo enjoy this set for what it is: one of the world's biggest stars, performing a few of the world's biggest songs, each set to a luminous arrangement. Post Malone himself seems surprised by how great this Tiny Desk concert sounds, and that's not just the humility talking.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Sunflower\"\n\"I Fall Apart\"\n\"Circles\"\n\"Enough Is Enough\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAustin Post: lead vocalist, guitar \nHannah Juliano: vocalist\nElliot Aguilar: vocalist\nChauncey Matthews: vocalist\nKola Rail: vocalist\nDestin Johnson: drums\nEmily Rosenfield: guitar \nBobby Wooten: bass \nLouis Bell: piano\nKevin Kuh: strings \nFrancesca Dardani: strings \nKiku Enomoto: strings\nKirin McElwain: strings\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Suraya Mohamed\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Zayrha Rodriguez, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Team: Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #postmalone","title":"Post Malone: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1088,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230815","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCcks-fwq2c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCcks-fwq2c/hqdefault.jpg?v=64da7e22","content":{"View count":4800019}}

{"description":"Pre-order NHL 24 X-Factor Edition: http://x.ea.com/77254\n\nEA SPORTS‚Ñ¢ NHL¬Æ 24 officially launches worldwide October 6th featuring Cale Makar as your cover athlete. \n\nIn NHL 24, all-new gameplay features bring authentic on-ice action to life. Experience the rush and fatigue of a high-pressure game with the Exhaust Engine, where sustained pressure in the attack zone leads to new game-changing effects like goalie fatigue that slows the netminder‚Äôs reaction time the more they get worn down with offensive action; change the momentum with Physics-Based Contact as you break the glass and send players into the bench with big body checks; and get unparalleled player command with the new Vision Passing System and Total Control Skill Moves.\n\nChel is more connected than ever with cross-play in all online team play modes, along with HUT Moments, which lets you recreate classic moments in hockey history and today‚Äôs biggest plays. Adding an extra layer of authenticity, Flex Moments introduces 75+ new goal celebrations, and a wholly refreshed presentation complements an enriched crowd atmosphere that makes playing the game feel like you‚Äôre at the game.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more NHL 24 Trailers: https://bit.ly/3kF5rTK\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsnhl\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsnhl \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/easportsnhl\n\n\n#NHL24 #Reveal","title":"NHL 24 Reveal Trailer | Official Gameplay","duration":321,"channel_id":"UCLydKeNR8rf-yoUu9J2acMg","author":"EA SPORTS NHL","date":"20230816","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSbtHgyMrX4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/TSbtHgyMrX4/hqdefault.webp?v=64dce76c","content":{"View count":326398}}

{"description":"Nuclear-weapons physicist Greg Spriggs rates seven nuclear-explosion scenes in movies.\n\nHe analyzes the portrayal of nuclear detonations and their effects in Steven Spielberg‚Äôs ‚ÄúIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull‚Äù (2008), starring Harrison Ford; ‚ÄúBroken Arrow‚Äù (1996), starring John Travolta; Christopher Nolan‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight Rises‚Äù (2012), starring Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, and Anne Hathaway; and Stanley Kubrick‚Äôs ‚ÄúDr. Strangelove‚Äù (1964). He also comments on what a nuclear explosion in outer space would really look like in comparison to Marvel‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Avengers‚Äù (2012), starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson; and Michael Bay‚Äôs ‚ÄúArmageddon‚Äù (1998), starring Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, and Liv Tyler. He breaks down the underwater detonation seen in ‚ÄúAmerican Assassin‚Äù (2017), starring Michael Keaton. And he explains how accurate Christopher Nolan‚Äôs recreation of the construction of the first atomic bomb in Los Alamos and the subsequent Trinity test was in \"Oppenheimer‚Äù (2023), starring Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh.\n\nSpriggs has been a nuclear-weapons physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for 20 years. He worked on a special project where he scanned, reanalyzed, and declassified old nuclear test films.\n\nYou can find more information about the Livermore National Laboratory at: www.llnl.gov\n\nThese movies show simulations of the effects of using nuclear weapons near the public. To date, the 1945 atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the only instances of nuclear weapons being detonated as an act of war.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?
