{"description":"For the second straight year, the San Francisco 49ers bounced the Dallas Cowboys from the playoffs with a 19-12 final score. Dak Prescott threw two interceptions in the first half and finished with just over 200 passing yards and one touchdown. The Cowboys last play, with Ezekiel Elliott snapping the ball to Dak, was shut down when KaVontae Turpin was immediately tackled after hauling in the short pass. Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe discuss the biggest reason America's Team came up short once again.\n\n#Undisputed #NFL #Cowboys\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫ Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n‚ñ∂ First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n‚ñ∂ The Herd with Colin Cowherd‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n‚ñ∫ SPEAK's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n‚ñ∫ FOX Bet Live‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n‚ñ∫ Club Shay Shay‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n‚ñ∫ The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n‚ñ∫ What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n‚ñ∂ The Carton Show‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\nFollow UNDISPUTED on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@undisputedonfs1?lang=en\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.

And all of it was online and available at the click of a button. \n\nThis is the story of this unique investigation, conducted entirely through open source techniques, harnessing the power of google searching and social media stalking to expose a massive failure of the US military. \n\n‚ÄúUS Soldiers Expose Nuclear Weapons Secrets Via Flashcard Apps‚Äù by Foeke Postma for Bellingcat is available to read here; \nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/05/28/us-soldiers-expose-nuclear-weapons-secrets-via-flashcard-apps/\n\nWatch more from this series: \n\nHow a 10-Year-Old Boy Was Forced to Join Isis\nhttps://youtu.be/P5bOIKpT6_A\n\nHow Putin's Oligarchs Hide Their Billions\nhttps://youtu.be/ySyx-7CZJfg \n\nThe Star of Netflix‚Äôs Cheer Sexual Abuse Scandal\nhttps://youtu.be/9jfdwR-rTzY \n\nHelp keep VICE News‚Äô fearless reporting free for millions by making a one-time or ongoing contribution here. - https://vice.com/contribute\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vicenews?lang=en\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\n\nFollow VICE World News here: \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@viceworldnews?lang=en\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/viceworldnews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/VICEWorldNews\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/viceworldnews/\n\n#VICENews #News","title":"The US Soldiers Leaking Nuclear Secrets","duration":569,"channel_id":"UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ","author":"VICE News","date":"20230123","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1Gy5nJ6GGE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A1Gy5nJ6GGE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":810979}}

The series has had two really good episodes back to back and as a big fan of the game I've loved watching these first two entries. They do change some things up though and throughout the video we're gonna be going over the easter eggs, game differences and also giving our thoughts on the series so far.\n\nHuge thank you to everyone who checked out our video last week and like that one we're gonna be saving the more spoilery easter eggs until the end so that people who haven't played the game can enjoy all the twists and turns that come up in the show. I'll give you a heads up before we hit that and we start the episode off in Jakarta all the way back in 2003.\n\nIf you cast your mind back to last week then you may remember that they did an announcement over the radio that talked about the city and how something strange was going on there. Here we see it playing out with the outbreak of the infection being studied by a doctor. This wasn't in the game and I like how the series is slowly filling in the backstory of the virus. Both the beginning of last episode and this one had completely new bits in them and it's possible that we might even get a new story slotted in at the opening of each entry that gives us way more details on the infection than what we ever got in the game.\n\nWhen the title cards first shown we can see this is taking place on September 24th 2003 dating it two days before the outbreak. This of course shows how fast the virus spread and in the game we learned it was through products contain flour and yeast which we'll talk more about in just a bit. Huge shoutouts to Dyanmic Smurf on our last video for pointing out that 2003 was potentially chosen because it was one of the hottest years on record which a record breaking heat wave happening that killed 20,000 people.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 2 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":1737,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230123","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crDFaekrmLE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/crDFaekrmLE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":460130}}

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•","title":"33 Hours in the World's Best First Class","duration":1536,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20230121","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6hpzfYV2fU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6hpzfYV2fU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1128094}}

There are 52 cards in a deck, plus 2 jokers (which I am going to include), so this is a HUGE project.

I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

For me, this moment came during the climax of the Pete Davidson film ‚ÄúThe King of Staten Island,‚Äù where his most important line was impossible to understand. \n\nI had to rewind three times ‚Äî and eventually put subtitles on ‚Äî to finally pick up what he was saying.\n\nThis experience isn‚Äôt unique ‚Äî gather enough people together and you can generally separate them into two categories: People who use subtitles, and people who don‚Äôt. And according to a not-so-scientific YouTube poll we ran on our Community tab, the latter category is an endangered species ‚Äî 57% of you said you always use subtitles, while just 12% of you said you generally don‚Äôt.\n \nBut why do so many of us feel that we need subtitles to understand the dialogue in the things we watch?\n\nThe answer to that question is complex ‚Äì and we get straight to the bottom of it in this explainer, with the help of dialogue editor Austin Olivia Kendrick.\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Use my code PAOLO15 at https://partner.bokksu.com/paolo15  to get $15 off your first Bokksu Japanese snack box!\n\nThis is a Japan behind the counter food tour of a local Japanese bento shop. For more than 40 years, Bento Kawano has been making delicious Japanese handmade bento lunches at the affordable price of 600yen. At this value and quality it‚Äôs no surprise everyday that the customer lunch lines wrap around the entire block.  One important things about this Japanese bento shop is that they must be extra careful about food safety.  Since Bentos are designed to be able to sit on the shelf for several hours without refrigeration, the food must always be fully cooked. Run by Japanese food craftsman, Inoue san, he changes the menu everyday so his customers have something to look forward to.  He particularly enjoys analyzing the performance of his previous bentos and creating new ones to see how popular it will be, but ultimately he says that whatever bento he serves, he creates each one as if he‚Äôll be sharing it with his loved ones. Interestingly, this Tokyo bento shop runs 4 rice cookers simultaneously throughout the entire day to keep up with the demand using a special hitomebore rice from Miyagi prefecture known for its exquisite taste especially when its cooled down.  Even the rice at the shop was specifically selected by Inoue san.  I hope you enjoy this Tokyo Hidden gem bento shop.   \n\nBento Kawano\n- https://goo.gl/maps/LUWZtAGDey1msVFw6\n- https://www.genkigohan.com/\n\nWatch more Japan Behind the Counter videos here\n- https://tokyozebra.com/btc\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n___ Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ___\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?

{"description":"Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are known for being open world games. If you want to go somewhere, you can. Because you're able to choose what you do with the story, I challenged myself to see how many Pokemon you could actually catch before having to obtain a badge in the game... and the result was pretty insane. This video took a lot of time and effort to put together, so I'd really appreciate it if you shared this with a friend. If you have any suggestions for the next video, leave it in the comments below!
