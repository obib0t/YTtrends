{"description":"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nBobby Carter | June 30, 2022\n\"We celebrate Black Music Month. This has been Black magic.\" Truer words may have never been spoken behind the Tiny Desk as R&B goliath Usher caps off our month-long celebration of Black music, highlighting a catalog chock-full of hits spanning 25 years. It's been over two years since NPR headquarters was abuzz with chatter of a legend in the building. After an early morning rehearsal for his set at the Something in the Water Festival in Washington, D.C., he made his way over to deliver an unforgettable performance.\n\nUsher and his band, all dipped in black, set it off with an introduction over a funky horn-laced instrumental reminiscent of a Blaxploitation flick. They keep that groove going right into a reworked version of his 1997 breakout single, \"You Make Me Wanna...\" Twenty-five years later, Usher sits arguably as the king of R&B. Between 2000 and 2010, there was no debate whatsoever, with his string of records that included the biggest R&B album of the 21st century, Confessions.\n\nWhat he's done in the vocal booth is only half of his claim to fame. The stage is where he's continued to shine as he prepares for the second leg of his Las Vegas residency. This loose and playful set touches on his many career phases; the crooning, the deeply personal, the club bangers and even the Tik Tok challenges indicate that he could just be reaching his prime. Recently, we've heard plenty of hot takes, wild battles and social media fodder about who sits at the mountaintop in the world of R&B. Usher Raymond has entered the chat.\n\nSET LIST\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\"\n\"Superstar\"\n\"U Don't Have to Call\"\n\"Nice & Slow\"\n\"Confessions Part II\"\n\"My Way\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nUsher: vocals\nEric Bellinger: vocals\nVedo: vocals\nDmitry Gorodetsky: bass\nLemar Guillary: trombone\nBrandyn Phillips: trumpet\nJay Flat: saxophone\nDarek Cobbs: keys\nErick Walls: guitar\nRyan Carr: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Kara Frame\nEditor: Michael Zamora\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, Alanté Serene\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #usher #BMM","title":"Usher: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1487,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220630","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8ODGFWgFg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/up8ODGFWgFg/hqdefault.jpg?v=62bcc32c","content":{"View count":1395600}}

{"description":"This Halloween Season, some legends never die. Hocus Pocus 2, an Original movie event, streaming September 30 on Disney Plus.\n\nBette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy reunite for the highly anticipated Disney+ Original Movie “Hocus Pocus 2.” The live-action, long awaited sequel to the perennial Halloween classic, which brings back the delightfully wicked Sanderson sisters for more comedic mayhem, will debut on Disney+ on September 30.\n\nIt’s been 29 years since someone lit the Black Flame Candle and resurrected the 17th-century sisters, and they are looking for revenge. Now it is up to three high-school students to stop the ravenous witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on Salem before dawn on All Hallow’s Eve. “Hocus Pocus 2” also stars Doug Jones (“The Shape of Water”), Whitney Peak (“Gossip Girl”), Lilia Buckingham (“Dirt”), Belisa Escobedo (“American Horror Stories”), Hannah Waddingham (“Ted Lasso”), Tony Hale (“Veep”), Sam Richardson (“The Tomorrow War,” “Good Boys”), Juju Brener (“Vanquish”), Froy Gutierrez (“Teen Wolf”), Taylor Paige Henderson and Nina Kitchen. The film is directed by Anne Fletcher (“Dumplin,’” “The Proposal”), written by Jen D’Angelo (“Happy Together,” “Workaholics”) and produced by Lynn Harris (“King Richard,” “The Shallows”), with Adam Shankman (“Disenchanted,” “Hairspray”), Ralph Winter (“Hocus Pocus,” “X-Men” franchise) and David Kirschner (“Hocus Pocus,” “Chucky”) serving as executive producers.","title":"Teaser Trailer | Hocus Pocus 2 | Disney+","duration":81,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20220628","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecJRvz9nk-U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ecJRvz9nk-U/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2946642}}

{"description":"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nAshley Pointer | June 29, 2022\nAfter taking a sip of his tea towards the end of his six-song set, Denzel Curry turns to his band and exclaims: “We lowkey breezed through this b****! That’s great for two rehearsals!” \n\nFrom the moment Curry and his people stepped foot into NPR headquarters to record their Tiny Desk concert, the vibes were right. With a 10-piece configuration — consisting of drums, bass, keys, guitar, horns and percussion — the rapper put on a flawless and inspired live performance of songs off his latest LP as well as some of his biggest hits, all freshly arranged for the Tiny Desk.  \n\nOver the course of a decade, Curry has released a number of albums and EPs, becoming one of the most versatile emcees in hip-hop today. His sixth studio album, Melt My Eyez See Your Future, marked a new artistic beginning for him: infusing neo-soul, jazz and traditional hip-hop influences into the album, with less “rah” and more mature introspection. Throughout this concert, you get a little bit of both. \n\nCurry and the Cold-Blooded Soul Band open their set with “Melt Session #1,” a feel-good neo-soul groove where Curry’s introspective lyrics flow beautifully, taking center stage. Then kicking it up a notch, Curry performs “Walkin” and “Troubles” with an assist from DJ POSHtronaut, employing some serious bounce complimented by catchy horn lines. In the second half of his set, Curry takes us back with “DIET_.” Evoking instant head-bops as bass and drums smoothly lock in, Curry charms our audience with his improvised rhymes and exuberant personality.  \n\nAs Curry and the band closed out the concert going absolutely bonkers with “RICKY,”  I could feel how light the room had gotten as everyone in the audience fed off Curry’s infectious energy fueled by distorted guitar and bass and punchy horns. “You know I killed that s***. You know I murked that s***!” Yes, Denzel Curry. Yes you did. \n\nSET LIST\n“Melt Session #1”\n“Walkin”\n“Troubles”\n“DIET_”\n“CLOUT COBAIN | CLOUT CO13A1N”\n“RICKY”\n\nMUSICIANS\nDenzel Curry: vocals\nDJ POSHtronaut: vocals\nMarcus Paul: trumpet \nBrandyn Phillips: trumpet\nTim McKay: saxophone/flute\nAlex Csillag: trombone\nBrian Gazo: percussion\nBrian Patterson: drums\nJay Winfield: keys\nJack Siegel: guitar\nDavid McKinzie: bass\n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nEditor: Kara Frame\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, Alanté Serene\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #BMM #denzelcurry","title":"Denzel Curry: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1184,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220629","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glHqWvkpRqo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/glHqWvkpRqo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":420272}}

{"description":"Because of the potential size of the future, the most important thing about our actions today might be their impact on future generations. This simple-sounding idea has some surprising moral implications: https://80000hours.org/kurzgesagt-last-human\n\nSources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sources-last-human/\n\nThis video was created in partnership with the Open Philanthropy Project\n\nKurzgesagt in 8 languages: https://linktr.ee/kgs_international\n\nThe future of humanity seems insecure. Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism and so many people think our end is in sight. But humans always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on. \nThis is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants. What makes this worse is that we actually may live at an extremely critical moment in human history. To understand why, let us look at the temporal window of humanity and ask:\nWhen will the last human be born and how many people will there ever be? \n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤  https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3A5LwaB\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3OzdsIs\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible: ziipzaaapM16A4, Filippo, Alloy robot, Harold Mabin Jr, Toby Lowe, BiohazardVictim, Riad Salihu, Gunnstein Lye, Jeff Wheeldon, Andy Kelly, Quenby Joanette, Daniel Schulte-Hillen, Val Kabalkin, Maximilian Thomas Goldstein, Tyler Lindberg, Felix, Davesanify, Russ Newman, Kira, Thomas Schenck, Skyler Stanley, dirk from wellington, LoveGiants (Polyamorous) Seeking 4 BrotherHusbands, BalrogWing, Coffee is the path to victory, Addie, Lucas, vb, Santiago Perez, Robert Walsh, Angus Jake Smith, JamesDBartlett3, Marlison Gosalvez de Alencar, Rahul Golwalkar, Keerthi Vasan, Brian Bradley, Lincoln Volk, Haubrechts, Avalanche, Craig B, Tina Hatch, Nathan Ornat, Amathara, khalifa almehairbi, jtfletchbot, Steven Zeck, Maurice Ibler, Bafy78, Andreas Høve Smidt-Nielsen, Victoria Camp, Andrew Dawson, pierluigi valente, GH, Jay C, Sergey Melnik, CultistLemming, Thane Stevens, Alex MacKay, SimpleAvocado, Dave Kircher, Karen Rosenow, James Pita, Kyron","title":"The Last Human – A Glimpse Into The Far Future","duration":751,"channel_id":"UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q","author":"Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell","date":"20220628","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/LEENEFaVUzU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3624087}}

{"description":"PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/foolishbaseball\nTWEETER: https://twitter.com/FoolishBB\nMERCH: https://shop.jomboymedia.com/collections/foolish-baseball\n________________________________________\nThis one's about the best and worst umpires, at least with regards to calling the MLB strike zone. Umpire Angel Hernandez is probably the most infamous at the moment, but do you know Pat Hoberg? John Libka? Alan Porter? They're gonna be umpiring the strike zone for a lot longer than Angel Hernandez, Laz Diaz, or CB Bucknor.\n\nIn this episode of Baseball Bits, a Foolish Baseball production, there will be plenty of time to look at some MLB worst calls and MLB best calls, especially with regards to the MLB strike zone. But we'll also dig deeper on the subject of Robo-umps, the Automated Ball Strike System that may soon replace human strike zone callers. \n\nUmpScoreCards is a fairly new, public-facing way to grade umpires, and we'll be leaning on their work heavily to find the truth. Does MLB have an umpire problem? Kyle Schwarber seems to think so.

{"description":"Hello friends & welcome to another video!! This week, I traveled to a Lost Luggage store with HopeScope to buy and try some lost luggage items...\n\nOver the past few years, we have tried a number of interesting ~secondhand purchasing experiences~, like buying an abandoned storage unit, buying a box of Amazon customer returns, and visiting an Amazon returns store - and something that I have been very interested in trying for quite a while now, is buying lost airline luggage. Because apparently if you lose a piece of luggage while traveling, and never come back for it, the airline will eventually sell it. And if you're in the US, chances are that they will sell it to the Unclaimed Baggage store in Scottsboro, AL - who sorts through and resells the items from that lost luggage. So we flew down there with our friend HopeScope to check out the store and buy a lost luggage haul of our own: a head-to-toe outfit each!! What did you guys think of our lost looks? Would you shop at this store?\n\nPS - Unclaimed Baggage does sell some of their inventory online here!\nhttps://www.unclaimedbaggage.com/\n\nCheck out HopeScope's channel & video here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAM2fyCjEdROyELretVTiiw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5aHcu19wio\n\nCheck out Unclaimed Baggage here! \nhttps://www.instagram.com/unclaimedbag/\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nLona Smith\nBryce Jennings\nDave Szamet\nNez Covington\nJarvis Rooker\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza","title":"I Went To A Lost Luggage Store","duration":1677,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20220626","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h31p4OLbqSc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/h31p4OLbqSc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2916948}}
