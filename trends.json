{"description":"SUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUnxiP7q4RDDyeioZFZLnXA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGET MERCH HERE: https://www.pivotpodcast.com\n\nWe have had our¬†biggest Pivot guest in Shaq and now today, he may be our smallest guest but by far the biggest show we've done...Kevin Hart joins the Pivot and we promise we didn't F**k this one up!\n\nWith nothing off limits, this conversation is the perfect blend of insightful stories, life experiences and sound advice with some \"light-harted\"¬†moments as Ryan, Channing and Fred talk with Kevin about everything from his career to family to personal miscues¬†to getting to the top and staying there.¬†¬†\n\nStraight off the stage at Madison Square Garden with Chris Rock and Dave Chapelle, Kevin sits down with us and is very candid about how his journey has evolved and his addiction to winning motivates him everyday to keep being better and expanding. Stressing the power of collaborations and relationships, Kevin says there is room for more than one great in a certain space and sharing success is the best way to stay at the top, recognizing that, the blessing and the curse, is the sacrifices we make to get where we want to be.¬†\n\nRyan asks Kevin how living out some of his personal relationship issues in the public eye with his¬†first marriage and now his second, never affected his¬†persona or allowed scandals to be larger than the purpose. \n\nKevin opens up on how being honest and owning his mistakes publicly allowed him to move forward and also earn respect and grace along the way. Nobody is perfect and when we realize that everyone messes up, it's easier to block out the people who don't matter and focus on what does. Kevin explains how he turned his miscues into humor allowing art to imitate life and became better for it.¬†\n\nLeave it to Channing to derail the conversation as he tries to ask a simple question that pivots the show into an entirely different direction that gives Kevin an up close and personal look into the wild mind of Channing but it doesn't take for Channing to realize he has met his match as Kevin fires back and it's priceless.¬†\n\nGetting into a little Philadelphia history, Fred talks about some of the greats and people Kevin admires from his hometown with the long history of stars. As we get ready to head off to our NFL training camp tour, Ryan couldn't help but ask Kevin about his infamous Philly Super Bowl Snub a few years ago and the story is just as funny now as it was back then.¬†\n\nNew Episodes of the Pivot premiere every Tuesday at Noon eastern with special drops on Friday afternoons. Since January 4th, We have released¬†over 50 episodes, accumulated over 40 million views and have almost 500K subscribers. As We wrap our first season and prepare to hit the road to start our NFL Training camp Tour next Tuesday, we will be¬†bringing you some of the best football guests in the NFL cities we visit- it's going to be a wild ride so thank you for sticking with us and making this PIVOT with us!¬†\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HAPPY DAD: https://youtube.com/channel/UCRVEzpUvlbs06pNZ1WSzg2A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFOLLOW THE PIVOT PODCAST:\nINSTAGRAM | https://instagram.com/thepivot\nTWITTER | https://twitter.com/thepivot\nTIKTOK | https://tiktok.com/@thepivot\nFACEBOOK | https://facebook.com/thepivotpodcast\nSPOTIFY | https://open.spotify.com/show/5KtXTWiC3J5WW1CVTpYG5V\nAPPLE PODCASTS | https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pivot-podcast/id1603292451\n\n#ThePivot\n#Podcast\n#ChanningCrowder\n#FredTaylor\n#RyanClark\n#HappyDad","title":"Kevin Hart on Sacrifice, Success & Never Allowing Mistakes to Overshadow Purpose | The Pivot Podcast","duration":4061,"channel_id":"UCUnxiP7q4RDDyeioZFZLnXA","author":"The Pivot Podcast","date":"20220726","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_alcE8PfzbI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_alcE8PfzbI/hqdefault.jpg?v=62e004c9","content":{"View count":942496}}

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n00:00 The last 6.5 yearsüåé\n02:32 OUR 101st COUNTRY IS‚Ä¶!\n05:02 Therapy is awesome :)\n06:00 Travel day to Country #101!‚úàÔ∏è\n09:25 WE MADE IT\n11:31 Getting lost‚Ä¶part 1\n12:41 First impressions of Country 101\n13:48 Our ‚ÄúGame Plan‚Äù for this trip\n14:40 First traditional breakfast‚Ä¶& a little drama‚òïÔ∏è\n16:20 LOVING this city!

{"description":"Armor officer and military tank historian Nicholas Moran rates eight tank battles in movies, such as \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Fury,\" for realism. \n\nMoran breaks down the accuracy of World War II tank history and battle tactics in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), and \"Fury\" (2014). He looks at the realism of features and capabilities of tanks used in \"GoldenEye\" (1995), \"Fast & Furious 6\" (2013), and \"Batman Begins\" (2005).

During his battle with cancer Chadwick kept it a secret from almost everyone around him and thus Marvel didn't even know that he had the disease. Going back and watching his performances it's incredible that he was even able to deliver to the level that he did and it's a testament to how strong of a person that he was. He's obviously left a big hole and we know that this film will very much centre around the mantle being passed. Due to controversies around Leticia Wright there's been a lot of different rumours over whether she's gonna get the mantle or not and from this first look it seems like there might even be multiple people vying for it. This movie is also going to be introducing Namor, RiRi Williams and it will center around the war between Wakanda and Atlantis.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but if you could smash that thumbs up button and also subscribe for Heavy Spoilers forever. With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into the trailer.\n\n-\n\nOk so the trailer itself is extremely somber and we open with a cover of Bob Marley's no woman no cry. Marley sadly passed away at the age of 36 and us being robbed of an icon is something that feels like it might be echoing the death of Chadwick Boseman. I hope I don't sound disrespectful there but it's just kind of the emotion and reason behind this song choice. Really got me teary eyed and this is one of the most beautiful trailers I've ever watched. His imagery is laced throughout the teaser and we also get what I believe might even be the funeral of T'Challa. How he dies we don't really get to see but there's this strong focus on him with him even getting his own mural. They of course did something similar in Far From Home with Tony Stark but here it feels infinitely more impactful due to the real life knowledge that we have about the actor.\n\nMusic - LAKEY INSPIRED - Arcade\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired","title":"BLACK PANTHER Wakanda Forever Trailer Breakdown | Easter Eggs, Hidden Details & Characters Explained","duration":947,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20220724","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMgNkh5AiYI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HMgNkh5AiYI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":756132}}

{"description":"Discover the legend that forged the rings. September 2 on Prime Video. #TheRingsOfPower\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien‚Äôs pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N√∫menor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power - SDCC Trailer","duration":182,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220722","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYnQDsaxHZU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYnQDsaxHZU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":10696628}}

{"description":"Dream Dangerously. Enter the world of THE SANDMAN on August 5, only on Netflix.\n\nThere is another world that waits for all of us when we close our eyes and sleep ‚Äî a place called the Dreaming, where The Sandman, Master of Dreams (Tom Sturridge), gives shape to all of our deepest fears and fantasies. But when Dream is unexpectedly captured and held prisoner for a century, his absence sets off a series of events that will change both the dreaming and waking worlds forever. To restore order, Dream must journey across different worlds and timelines to mend the mistakes he‚Äôs made during his vast existence, revisiting old friends and foes, and meeting new entities ‚Äî both cosmic and human ‚Äî along the way.\n\nBased on the beloved award-winning DC comic series written by Neil Gaiman, THE SANDMAN is a rich, character-driven blend of myth and dark fantasy woven together over the course of ten epic chapters following Dream‚Äôs many adventures. Developed and executive produced by Gaiman, showrunner Allan Heinberg, and David S. Goyer.\n\nWatch The Sandman, only on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/thesandman\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 221 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

In an effort to cross the Sonic frontiers ‚Äì from friendship to relationship ‚Äì Amy Rose had the two-tailed fox head up her transformation into what she thought would be the dream girl of Sonic the Hedgehog.
