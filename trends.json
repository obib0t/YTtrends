{"description":"In August 2023, it took about twice as long to sell an EV in the U.S. as it did the previous January. Prices of EVs are down 22% year-over-year and that's mainly driven by Tesla. About two thirds of EVs sold are Elon Musk's brand. Companies like Ford have ramped up hybrid production as demand has leveled off. While slightly more than half of consumers say EVs are the future and will eventually replace Internal Combustion Engines, less than a third of dealers say so. This all comes at a time when investments in EVs are more than ever. So what's really going on?

{"description":"Up in the sky, that's a rocket arcing over the sky in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. And see that explosion? That's the iron dome missile defense system in action.. Intercepting and eliminating the projectile.\n\nIt might seem like not much more than a blip in the sky, but take a look at the view at night. Each of those explosions is right here. A thwarted rocket attack.\n\nThe Israeli company that developed the iron dome system says the system has destroyed thousands of unguided rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon into Israel since 2011.\n\nBut the iron dome isn't really a dome. Though it's meant to create a force field effect. They're movable batteries, attached to missile launchers that look like this.\n\nAnd here's how it works - so first, its radar senses a rocket when it's getting close. Anywhere from 2.5 to 43 miles away. According to Raytheon - a U.S. defense contractor that helps produce them. Then, the iron dome's control center kicks into gear - and quickly analyzes whether a rocket will hit populated areas. If it determines the rocket will hit a town or a city, the system will tell a launcher to shoot off a missile that will intercept and destroy it mid-air. The fragments of metal and debris then fall to the ground.\n\nThe Israeli defense forces reported that it intercepted more than 95 percent of rockets during an operation last May. Over the last few days, the Israeli military says 4,500 rockets were fired from Gaza, and the Iron Dome has intercepted many.\n\n===================\n\nWCNC Charlotte considers multiple perspectives and provides diverse points of view.

{"description":"Watch the official trailer for #AmericanFiction, starring Jeffrey Wright, Tracee Ellis Ross, Issa Rae, and Sterling K. Brown. From Writer/Director Cord Jefferson. Only in theaters this December.\n\n AMERICAN FICTION is Cord Jefferson's hilarious directorial debut, which confronts our culture‚Äôs obsession with reducing people to outrageous stereotypes. Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who‚Äôs fed up with the establishment profiting from ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.\n\nAbout MGM Studios: Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) is a leading entertainment company focused on the production and global distribution of film and television content across all platforms.

He also adds that he didn't appreciate everyone doubting him, including his friend and artist Drake, who bet on Logan Paul to knock out Dillon.\n\nDillon goes on to say if Logan Paul was a man, he would keep his side of the bargain and fight him in MMA, where Dillon believes not only could he beat Logan, but also the likes of KSI, Jake Paul and even boxers such as Floyd Mayweather.

When I left school, I fell into a wonderful job at a local small engine shop where I worked the counter for a couple years. In 2010 my husband and I opened up our own small engine shop in central Arkansas where I am able to work alongside my family and best friends. We see over 2,000 pieces of small engine equipment every year, and answer 1,000's of small engine questions. We specialize in brands such as Briggs and Stratton, Kohler, Echo and Shindaiwa, but work everyday on MANY other brands like Stihl, Husqvarna, Honda, Craftsman, Remington, Red Max, Troy Bilt, Scag, Bad Boy, Hustler, World Lawn, Poulan, Mantis, Etc..
