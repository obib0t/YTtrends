{"description":"üëæ My Discord Server: https://discord.gg/5ZYbXPf\nüî¥  Live Channel:  @lukestephenslive \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nStarfield is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was announced during Bethesda's E3 presentation in 2018. The game takes place in a space-themed setting, and is the first new intellectual property developed by Bethesda in 29 years. It is set to release for Windows and Xbox Series X/S on September 6, 2023.\n\nStarfield is an action role-playing video game. Players can switch between a first-person and third-person perspective any time in the game. Starfield features an open world in the form of an area within the Milky Way galaxy, containing both fictional and non-fictional planetary systems, with players being able to land on more than 1,000 planets and an unspecified number of moons and space stations. The majority of the landscapes within the game were procedurally generated; they were subsequently modified and handcrafted content was developed around them. The game will generate the terrain and the alien flora and fauna of a planet depending on the star of its system and its atmosphere, as well as locations of interest as the player approaches a planet. The largest city in the game, New Atlantis, is the largest fictional city Bethesda has developed. As the player explores the game world, they will encounter various non-playable characters (NPCs), some of whom may join the player's crew. Such NPCs may aid the player in combat, carry items, or during confrontations, speak to other NPCs on the player's behalf. Some may comment on choices the player makes. The player may station crew members at any of their constructed outposts. Each companion character has their own unique skills and abilities. Some recruitable NPCs are able to be romanced by the player.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n‚ïî‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ïê‚ïó\n‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïö‚ï£‚ïî‚ï£‚ïî‚ï£‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïê‚ï£ \n‚ï†‚ïó‚ïë‚ïö‚ïù‚ïë‚ïë‚ï†‚ïó‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïê‚ï£\n‚ïö‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïù‚ïö‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ïù\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe and I'll be your bestest friend!\n#starfield #xbox #gaming","title":"A correction to my 'Starfield' review...","duration":1042,"channel_id":"UCe4_UPAmhz2sqorGbF8oZHA","author":"Luke Stephens","date":"20230906","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M1ca57NZTw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1M1ca57NZTw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":252319}}

Picking up immediately after last weeks entry, that saw Ahsoka and co discovering the Eye of Sion after tracing the super star destroyer tracking device. This of course also explains how Hera shows up this week going against the Senators orders. Whether that means some of them are still inline with the Empire remains to be seen but as we know there are imperials in every aspect of the new republic.\n\nAnyway Ahsoka and co ended up landing in the Forest which is when droids were sent out after them and that takes us into the brand new entry. Directed by Pete Ramsey he co-directed Into The Spider-verse and Season 3 Episode 5 Of The Mandalorian.\n\n-\n\nNow we begin with the T6s crew trying to fix the ship so that they can reach out to home one with whats going on.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"AHSOKA Episode 4 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Easter Eggs, Review & Anakin Skywalker!","duration":1611,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230906","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vyRx2t8UDc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vyRx2t8UDc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":282344}}

{"description":"Suraya Mohamed | September 5, 2023\nChl√∂e Bailey and her band were scheduled to fly in the day before this show. But with thousands of flights delayed or canceled at the start of the 4th of July holiday weekend, one member couldn't make it into town. Because the arrangements were designed for two background vocalists, it didn't make sense to have just one and the team decided the ensemble would go without.\n\nBut you would never know something was missing here. Chl√∂e filled the room with a stunning vocal performance, her positive spirit and light radiated throughout the entire room. The band exuded a special energy too. Right from the first note, they locked into a groove that felt really good. \"Surprise,\" a hit from 2022, started out the set with a sexy bump and grind, R&B vibe that segued right into the body-popping \"Body Do.\" Next up was \"I Don't Mind,\" an afrobeat-infused party jam that really demonstrates her wide vocal range.\n\nThe party mood stayed strong with \"Worried,\" another favorite from her 2023 debut album In Pieces. Its reflective title track speaks to Chl√∂e's transparency around being vulnerable. She said, \"A lot of times I've been broken down and the cracks will be left, but that doesn't make me imperfect or it doesn't take away any beauty I have deep inside.\" That lovely disposition continued into the last song, \"Cheatback,\" a reminder that even if we think of seeking revenge, karma matters.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Surprise\"\n\"Body Do\" \n\"I Don't Mind\"\n\"Worried\"\n\"In Pieces\"\n\"Cheatback\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nChl√∂e: vocals \nBrandi Singleton: drums \nKyla Wright: bass\nElise Solberg: keys\nTaylor Gamble: guitar\nArnetta Johnson: trumpet\nCameron Johnson: trumpet\nDerek Dixie: musical direction, drum pad\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Suraya Mohamed \nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Keren Carri√≥n, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Team: Joshua Bryant, Hazel Cills \nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #chloe","title":"Chl√∂e: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1152,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIeqO2tyhcY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oIeqO2tyhcY/hqdefault.jpg?v=64f2327a","content":{"View count":530642}}
{"description":"The Exorcist: Believer\nOnly in Theaters October 6\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.  \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own. \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia O‚ÄôNeill), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil. \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar¬Æ winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before.\n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela‚Äôs neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela‚Äôs friend. \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award¬Æ nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.  \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty. \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment. \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Y√ºcer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures. \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever","title":"The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer 2","duration":159,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSGeC880CYw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/rSGeC880CYw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":5265276}}

{"description":"How Solar Power Got So Cheap ‚Ä¶ So Fast. Order yourself a LARQ Swig Top Bottle to go plastic free and enjoy ice cold water throughout the entire day.  https://bylarq.com/undecided3 CODE: MATT10. The growth of solar energy has exploded in the past few years. According to Our World in Data, solar power‚Äôs share of global electricity production jumped from 0.15% percent in 2010 to over 4.52% in 2022. This has left even the most optimistic solar energy adoption predictions in the dust. And everyone from skeptical naysayers to the loudest cheerleaders have been taken by surprise. In a 2012 Harvard Business School paper, researchers referred to solar energy as ‚Äúthe most expensive renewable energy.‚Äù Compare that to about a decade later where we‚Äôre entering solar power‚Äôs ‚Äúterawatt age.‚Äù The sun is now widely regarded as the cheapest way to generate electricity.

{"description":"Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances ‚Äì either side if the interval ‚Äì and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"Hey guys! Today is another episode from my series Thrift Store Makeovers, where I take a used, worn out item (OR sometimes from yard sales or  off of ebay) clean it up, fix it up and decorate it. I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. I've definitely missed these thrift flips and I want to do more thrifting soon.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Our current lawmakers are barring people from accessing the healthcare they need, risking lives over things they don't care to understand, and it makes me sick.\n\nTHE TEAM:\n\nAUDIO EDITOR: Cory\nhttp://instagram.com/morningjoeaudio\n\nSTORYBOARDS:\n\nBelle\nhttp://twitter.com/belleinpastel\n\nLaddi\nhttp://youtube.com/theladdi\n\nTyler\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tylerletson_/\n\nBACKGROUNDS + ASSETS:\n\nOskar\nhttp://twitter.com/oskardraws\nhttp://instagram.com/polaroskar\n\n\nClover\nhttp://twitter.com/cloversandmoss\nhttp://instagram.com/cloversandmoss\n\nNunu\nhttps://twitter.com/NuNuIsTaken\nhttps://www.youtube.com/NuNu91011\n\nANIMATION: \n\nLaddi\nhttp://youtube.com/theladdi\n\nDelaney\nhttps://www.delaneyoldenburgart.com/portfolio\n\nBreeezy\nhttps://instagram.com/breeezy.png\n\nViral\nhttps://www.instagram.com/viral_genesis/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ViralGenesis\n\nAnnika\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLpy30I4INA4y3GuiIFpriQ\nhttps://instagram.com/grunkleann\n\nRiah\nhttps://twitter.com/MissRiahArt\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MissRiah\n\nPRODUCTION MANAGER: Mel\nhttps://www.instagram.com/monmiimel/\n\nCHANNEL MANAGEMENT: David Seelos\n\nhttps://concurrent.co/\n\n#illymation #mychoice","title":"Why I got an \"Abortion\"","duration":857,"channel_id":"UCsKVP_4zQ877TEiH_Ih5yDQ","author":"illymation","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zM-YaTKN1M","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7zM-YaTKN1M/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1349630}}
