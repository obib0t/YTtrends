{"description":"Amy was willing to do anything to get Sonic to notice her. She just wanted Sonic and Amy to become a thing. A Sonamy thing. And that’s where Tails came in. In an effort to cross the Sonic frontiers – from friendship to relationship – Amy Rose had the two-tailed fox head up her transformation into what she thought would be the dream girl of Sonic the Hedgehog. But, has that resulted in her being able to call herself Mrs. Sonic Hedgehog? Well… you’ll see.\n\nThis isn’t a Sonic Origins story. This isn’t some Sonic game to the pink-haired girl. In fact, she’s got a bad case of Sonic mania. What began as a romantic comedy in her mind, has turned into a Sonic vs Amy nightmare for her. Forget Sonic exe: Amy exe has entered the chat.

{"description":"Machine Gun Kelly ft. glaive - more than life (Official Live Performance) \n\nWhether rapping, as he did in the early part of his career, or rocking, as he's doing these days, Machine Gun Kelly is one of those artists who starts fierce and gets fiercer. That impact comes from the punch of emotion at the core of his tunes - the guy comes on strong from the get-go. You can hear it on 2012's \"Wild Boy\" from his 'Lace Up' debut, and it's there on both the 'BINGE' and 'bloom' albums from a few years ago. In May, Billboard said \"there’s no one on the charts serving balls-to-the-wall rock’n’roll decadence like the 31-year-old musician.\" It's hard to disagree. Since he turned a punk-pop corner with blistering guitar tracks such as \"bloody valentine\" - a blitzkrieg bop if there ever was one - the Halsey duet \"forget me too,\" and his blackbear romp \"my ex's best friend,\" he's moved from respected cool guy to flat-out superstar. And he takes the success in stride; the name of his latest album is 'mainstream sellout.' If you caught the Billboard Awards in May, you know he poured it all out in his performance of \"Twin Flame.\" So much so that his sweetie Megan Fox tweeted her approval in a gushing example of PDA. \"Baby – so proud of you for giving such a vulnerable and emotional performance. You are magic.\" Fans will think something similar when they're done with our Official Live Performances. MGK roared through \"more than life\" with his pal glaive, and yes, they destroyed. More coming: stay close.\n\nWatch the official video of \"more than life\": https://youtu.be/BokDch3_g-Y\nWatch music videos by Machine Gun Kelly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUs8sGiP4avNaYNVO22INhQ\n\n\nMachine Gun Kelly \nhttps://tiktok.com/@machinegunkelly\nhttp://twitter.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://instagram.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://facebook.com/machinegunkelly\nhttp://machinegunkelly.com\n\nVevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\n\nDirector: Kyle Goldberg\nDirector of Photography: Skyler Brown\nSenior Line Producer: Jen Bates\nLine Producer: Maddy Schmidt\nProducer: Averi Smith\nProducer, Contrast Films: Haley Sliger\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nArt Director: Daniel Erb\n1st AD: Evan Coniglio\nProduction Coordinator: Cole Emery\n2nd AD: Aris Ray\n\n1st AC: Adam Marquez\n1st AC: Ben Steen\n2nd AC: Melissa Kirchho\n2nd AC: Keith Hudson\nJib/Crane Op: Christian Hurley\nCrane Tech: Harrison Reilly\nCrane Tech: Lucas Reilly\nDIT: Benjamin Crump\nProduction Assistant: Jordan Dominguez\nProduction Assistant: Mario Arita\nProduction Assistant: Dilllon Weidler\nProduction Assistant: Johnny Baez\nProduction Assistant: Matt Callahan\n\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nOn Set Dresser: Eric Moore\nOn Set Dresser: Tim Miller\n\nLighting Designer: Josh Beard\nKey Grip: Julien Janigo\nBest Boy Grip: Darrin Stuckwisch\n\nVFX Supervisor: Sydney Emery\nVFX: Austin Prahl\nMotion Design: Sydney Emery\nMotion Design: Jakub Blank\nDesign: Nick Resnicow\nPhotography: Brandon Bowen\nAudio: Casey Graham\n\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nColor: Company 3\nColorist: Joseph Bicknell\nPost Production Supervisor: Michael Colman\nProject Manager, Post Production: Dominic Siri\nMusic + Talent: Gabriela Prisciandaro + David McTiernan\n\n#MachineGunKelly  #morethanlife  #mainstreamsellout  \n\n\nMusic video by Machine Gun Kelly performing more than life (Official Live Performance). © 2022 Bad Boy/Interscope Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/Qd8oi8","title":"Machine Gun Kelly - more than life ft. glaive (Official Live Performance) | Vevo","duration":211,"channel_id":"UC2a9zmrdjvLsrRgi4G4blWw","author":"MGKVEVO","date":"20220720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs20GWAJVCE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bs20GWAJVCE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1341732}}
{"description":"This Video breaks youtube! How you might ask? Well the 2022 youtube algorithm is a unique creature with many fun exploits and algorithm glitches that allow us to manipulate it for extreme results. One such manipulation is watchtime! This is a great way for youtube to see if a video is clickbait or so interesting people watch it for longer potentially even replaying parts of it! So when a video has comparatively high watch time in comparison to other videos then the youtube algorithm loves to push it! \n\nSo today the spiffing brit exploits youtube with the 0.5x playback speed exploit that will double the amount of watch time the video gets. So watch as the youtube algorithm explained leads to some perfectly balanced results!  After all youtube seo is not needed when you ask how to grow on youtube with this completely unusable meta youtube algorithm hack!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. If you enjoyed this why not watch our community post exploit detailing how to get more views or our steam sale exploit cheesing the summer sale! \n\n00:00 - You Must Watch in 0.5x Speed\n00:12 - What Is Going On\n00:22 - The Exploit\n00:36 - The Youtube Algorithm\n00:50 - New Youtube Meta?\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\ntitle: This Video Breaks Youtube.\n\n#youtube #glitch #video","title":"This Video Breaks Youtube.","duration":72,"channel_id":"UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ","author":"The Spiffing Brit","date":"20220720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyguvcHwE3s","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TyguvcHwE3s/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1918946}}

{"description":"When adjusted for inflation, wages have remained virtually unchanged over the last 50 years, with workers today earning just 12 cents more than they did in 1972. And with inflation at its highest since 1971, Americans are feeling the pain of slow wage growth. Two-thirds of American workers said that inflation has outpaced any salary gains made in the past year. But some economists argue that the concept is merely a myth politicians use to promote their careers. So, how real is wage stagnation in America today and what does it mean for American workers?

{"description":"Better Call Saul Season 6 Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained. In-depth recap and review of “Fun and Games”. Please subscribe! 👉 http://bit.ly/PetePeppers\n\nIn the ninth episode of Better Call Saul's final season, we wrapped up the story of Jimmy McGill in the prequel's timeline. In the end, Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) made a decision to leave because even though she loves Jimmy (Bob Odenkirk), she contends that they are like poison when they are together. \n\nIn episode 9 after the breakup, the show jumps ahead in time to the Breaking Bad timeline. We see that Jimmy has completely transformed into Saul Goodman with Kim out of his life.  \n\nEpisode 609: “Fun and Games”\nDirected by Michael Morris\nWritten by Ann Cherkis\nOriginal Air Date July 18, 2022\nOfficial Synopsis: Gus attempts to smooth things over with the cartel while Mike ties up loose ends.\n\nHeralded as “a beautiful tragedy and gripping character drama” (IndieWire) and “one of the best dramas on television” (Vulture), Saul’s 13-episode final season will roll out in two parts with the first seven episodes beginning April 18 and culminating with the series’ final six episodes beginning July 11. \n\nBetter Call Saul’s final season concludes the complicated journey and transformation of its compromised hero, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), into criminal lawyer Saul Goodman. From the cartel to the courthouse, from Albuquerque to Omaha, season six tracks Jimmy, Saul and Gene as well as Jimmy’s complex relationship with Kim (Rhea Seehorn), who is in the midst of her own existential crisis. Meanwhile, Mike (Jonathan Banks), Gus (Giancarlo Esposito), Nacho (Michael Mando) and Lalo (Tony Dalton) are locked into a game of cat and mouse with mortal stakes.\n\nIf you want to leave me a tip for my work 💰 https://paypal.me/petepeppersYT\n\nWhat are your favorite BCS theories for the upcoming season 6?

Jimmy becomes the lawyer for former beat cop Mike Ehrmantraut,  whose relevant skill set allows him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The reality was a bloody lie. When Elizabeth Holmes claimed she'd invented a device that with a pinprick of blood could diagnose hundreds of medical conditions, she became the darling of Silicon Valley. Holmes, along with her business partner and ex-lover Sunny Balwani, then set about duping investors to bankroll their multi-billion dollar company, Theranos. But what the couple didn't count on was the courage of two of their own staff who knew the blood machine didn't work, and knew they had to tell the world. Now Holmes and Balwani have been found guilty of fraud and could face decades in jail.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

{"description":"Cameron Smith put together one of the great rounds in major history to become Champion Golfer of the Year at The 150th Open.\n\nThe Australian started the final day four strokes back from Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland but shot an incredible 64, which featured five birdies in a row at the beginning of the back nine and another on 18, to overhaul McIlroy and fend off Cameron Young by a stroke.\n\nHis finishing score of 20-under-par matched Henrik Stenson’s winning number from Royal Troon six years ago and is the joint-best score to par in Open history, and the lowest at St Andrews.\n\nSmith is also the first Australian to become Champion Golfer since Greg Norman in 1993 and in the process shot the lowest fourth round by a champion in St Andrews history, surpassing Zach Johnson’s 66 in 2015.\n\nSmith was three shots back from McIlroy at the beginning of the back nine but he switched his putter on when it mattered most, holing putts from five, 16, 11, 18 and five feet to swing the Championship his way.\n\nVisit www.TheOpen.com for the greatest stories in golf\n\nKeep in touch with us!\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/The-Open-Championship/ \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/TheOpen \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/theopen/\nTo LICENSE The Open footage, please contact IMG REPLAY   ▶ https://bit.ly/306V7dI","title":"Cameron Smith wins The 150th Open Championship | Final Round Highlights","duration":653,"channel_id":"UCZ5fOnOmQunH18xZGhu9f_Q","author":"The Open","date":"20220717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz-TB7qprhg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Cz-TB7qprhg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":879999}}
