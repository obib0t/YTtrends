In this video, we continue our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast.

{"description":"As they walk through the mines, Mando picks up a dusty Mandalorian helmet, when he’s captured by a large cyborg with a general grievous looking organic eye. Super cool concept whoever came up with this and then got it approved did a great job. I loved this, had some old revenge of the sith concept art vibes. He moves like Grievous, and is literally just a brain with one eye, the rest is mecahnical. Whatever this creature is, he has some very high end cybernetics, akin to Grievous’s.\n\nGrogu tries to free mando with the force but fails and so Din tells Baby Yoda to go get Bo Katan. Now some people in the live stream chat were wondering why he didn’t say go get Boba Fett, but I would say because there’s less explanation needed with Bo Katan and the fact that Bo knows Mandalore well. \nAs Baby Yoda grabs her attention by landing, they head in her ship, the Gauntlet Starfighter.\nLanding back on Mandalore, she tells Grogu it didn’t always look like this you know, as they land down and go find Mando, heading deep into the mines. Taking her helmet off as she stares at what has become of Mandalore. She says this once was a beautiful city, and that her family laid claim to it all…now it’s just a tomb. She’s quite aware of her surroundings as she pushes Grogu aside and blasts down some Allamites. We see how proficient she is as a fighter and mandalorian as she makes quick work of them without the dark saber at her side.\n\n\nHeading into the general grievous 2.0’s lair where mando is being held, she fights him and then summons the dark saber as she ignites it and moves so smooth and swiftly around unlike Din Djarin who wields it like it’s Thor’s heavy hammer and he’s unworthy as heck.\nBo beats the creature twice, once in his grievous form, and then again in his mecha warrior suit. The Dark saber is rumored to be more powerful than a lightsaber blade, but who knows for sure in canon.\n\n She seems inspired or perhaps has a nefarious plan behind this but tells Din she’ll take him to the springs he seeks for atonement. Grogu pfffts which tells me he doesn’t trust Bo, he can probably feel her nefarious feelings perhaps.\n\nShe says the empire set out to punish them to wipe away their memory of their glorious planet. Bo says what’s painful is not that the empire destroyed them, but rather the civil wars they endured for centuries, leading to the weakness for the Empire to break them.\nBo admits as a child she went to the springs to play but as her royal family would have her do, she would publicly recite the mandalorian tenets infront of large crowds. Mandalorian people loved to see their princess do so. The Mandalorian tenets, also known as the Resol'nare, are a set of core principles that define what it means to be a Mandalorian. The six tenets include: wearing armor, speaking the language of Mandoa, defending oneself and family, raising children as Mandalorians, contributing to the clan's welfare, and answering the call to action from the Mandalore.\n\nMando tells her he wishes to have met her father, and that he died defending mandalore. Mando pauses and says this is the way. She realizes how patriotic Mando is, and she seems to like it. I think there’s a bit of a chemistry here perhaps, but a love hate relationship perhaps.\n\nThey arrive at the living waters, and it’s a dark dungy looking place now. She reads the plaque and it states that this is the place of the great mythosaur, that mandalore the great was able to tame the mythical beast. It is said that if a mandalorian rides a mythosaur, they control all mandalore and mandalorians. I think it even goes beyond the authority of the dark saber. Personally, I think Mandalore the great is just the new canon version of mandalore the ultimate. Mandalore the Great was an ancient Mandalorian ruler who led the Mandalorians in a series of conflicts against the Jedi Order.\nAs Din walks into the water and recites his vow as a mandalorian and the creed, Bo looks on in admiration of his loyalty and passion for Mandalorians. She seems like she really respects it, as he recites and walks further, he drops like a sack of bricks in the water all the way to the bottom surface where Bo grabs him and as she blasts back up to the surface with Mando, she passes a GIANT creature, a mythosaur thought to be extinct!\n\nSo the Mythosaur still exists. This means rule over Mandalore is still possible if one is to tame the creature, which is exactly what I think Bo Katan will do. She may tame the beast, use it to defeat Din and take the dark saber for herself. \n\nA funny theory is if Grogu uses beast control to tame the beast, making him the leader of Mandalore, or perhaps Din if he tells the Mythosaur to answer to him.\n\n\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/realswtheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Episode 2 S3 BREAKDOWN - IT EXISTS!!","duration":888,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20230308","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUi5dyWfWnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cUi5dyWfWnE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":272431}}

{"description":"The 2023 Lotus Emira First Edition ($94,430 USD as spec’d, $120,688 CAD) is a brand new sports car with two engine choices. A torquey AMG 4 cylinder mated to a 6 speed auto, or a supercharged 3.5L V6 with a manual option. Both options come with strong horsepower numbers at 359 hp and 400 hp respectively, but the smaller 4 cylinder actually has a bit more torque. James has secretly used the company credit card to put a deposit down on a new Emira, and Thomas is learning that they will either have to take delivery, or forfeit their deposit altogether.

{"description":"A 22-year-old construction manager served as one of the 12 jurors who found Alex Murdaugh guilty of murdering his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, after deliberating for less than three hours. James, who asked that his last name be withheld, spoke to the Law&Crime Network's Angenette Levy about the kennel video, how prayer played a role in the trial, whether Alex Murdaugh's testimony mattered, and more.\n\nNOTE: James' brother is a Colleton County sheriff's deputy who responded to Moselle the night of the murders but was not involved in the investigation.

I’ve been interested in true crime for the longest time now, what started with me watching true crime on TV with my Nan from a young age eventually turned into studying for a degree in Law & Criminology.\n\nWhen I first watched Bailey Sarian’s series I was completely hooked, I loved how she had combined two of the things I’m most passionate about and delivered it so well. She totally inspired me to take the leap and do the same thing on my channel, so all credit for the idea goes 100% to her.\n\nI’m from the UK and will be covering cases from both the UK and internationally, let me know if there are any cases that you’d like to see from me!

After many weeks... here is the video that almost defeated me, the grand finale of our Vegas trip - where we ate at every celebrity chef restaurant on the Vegas strip! Now as some of you all may know, Tyler and I are big Food Network fans - and while we were in Vegas, we decided to visit one of every celebrity chef's restaurant on the Strip! We stuffed our faces with numerous dishes, from the trash can-iest nachos at Guy Fieri's, to the elegant Italian pasta of Giada de Laurentiis, to the famed Beef Wellington at Gordon Ramsay's. Which restaurant would you try? Should we do a part 2 and go to the Jonas Brothers' restaurant?\n\nAlso, there is some controversy around foie gras that we weren't aware of before filming, our apologies. If you'd like to know more, here are a couple of links to some more information -\nhttps://www.foodunfolded.com/article/the-ethics-of-foie-gras\nhttps://qz.com/1750093/farmers-and-chefs-think-there-may-be-an-ethical-future-for-foie-gras\nhttps://medium.com/age-of-awareness/ethical-foie-gras-reality-or-just-clever-marketing-2deb95805bb6\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nCarrie Roper\nMelissa Douglas\nPhil Kinney\nClare Gelber\nElizabeth Pinotti\nNez Covington\nIshara Mathews\nMike Pearson III\nSteven Yonce\nGerman Torres\nCorey Glynn\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n2:02 What is a Celebrity Chef?\n3:53 David Chang - Momofuku\n8:05 Gordon Ramsay - Hell’s Kitchen\n12:29 Tom Colicchio - Heritage Steak\n15:43 José Andrés - Bazaar Meat\n19:54 Bobby Flay - Bobby’s Burgers\n23:21 Buddy Valastro - Pizza Cake\n26:30 Guy Fieri - Guy Fieri’s Vegas Kitchen and Bar\n30:13 Giada De Laurentiis - Giada\n34:00 Lisa Vanderpump - Vanderpump À Paris\n38:12 Masaharu Morimoto - Morimoto\n41:19 Emeril Lagasse - New Orleans Fish House\n44:15 Robert Irvine - Public House\n48:04 Michael Mina - Stripsteak\n48:52 Roy Choi - Best Friend\n50:18 Celeb Chef Restaurants We Missed\n50:30 Martha Stewart - The Bedford\n50:41 Wolfgang Puck - Spago\n50:55 Michael Mina & Ayesha Curry - International Smoke \n51:11 Nobu Matsuhisa - Nobu\n51:15 Lorena Garcia - Chica \n51:25 Mark Wahlberg - Wahlburgers\n51:34 Outro\n\n#travel #food #vlog","title":"I Ate At Every Celebrity Chef's Restaurant On The Vegas Strip","duration":3229,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230302","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGgyputhpA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BPGgyputhpA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2930446}}

{"description":"Look alive, foolish mortals! We’re dying for you to view our teaser trailer and poster for Disney’s comically creepy adventure “Haunted Mansion,” which will appear in theaters on July 28. \n \nDirected by award-winning filmmaker Justin Simien, the film features an all-star ensemble cast including LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Chase W. Dillon and Dan Levy, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto as The Hatbox Ghost.\n \nDirector Simien says, “As a lifelong fan of the Haunted Mansion attraction, I’m beyond excited to share the teaser trailer for our new film adaptation featuring an incredible cast. Our team has worked tirelessly to create a scary, funny and cinematic otherworldly adventure for both new and die-hard fans to enjoy! I can’t wait for audiences to experience this big screen version of the iconic Disney attraction.”\n \nInspired by the classic theme park attraction, “Haunted Mansion” is about a woman and her son who enlist a motley crew of so-called spiritual experts to help rid their home of supernatural squatters. The film’s producers are Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich, with Nick Reynolds and Tom Peitzman serving as executive producers.\n \nSOCIAL MEDIA:\n#HauntedMansion\nIG: @HauntedMansion\nTW: @HauntedMansion\nFB: @HauntedMansion","title":"Haunted Mansion | Official Teaser Trailer","duration":104,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20230302","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gartMjonTXc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gartMjonTXc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4312293}}

Iron bacteria lives by oxidizing dissolved iron 2 oxide in the water table, converting it to insoluble iron 3 oxide, which precipitates out of solution forming an orange slime. This material can be concentrated to a paste that can be shaped into objects. After drying out completely, the material becomes insoluble in water just as cement does.\n\nI don't know for sure why it does this but I suspect that while it's wet, there's still some dissolved iron 2 oxide in the material. When air gets to the iron 2 oxide and converts it to iron 3 oxide it precipitates out. It then becomes a solid, cementing itself to the other iron 3 already present. This is probably why iron bacteria sometimes forms solid lumps known as bog ore. Bog ore was once primarily used for smelting into iron but was also occasionally used as a building material (not as a cement but as solid building blocks).\n\nThe potential use for this material could be as a cement-like material or mortar used in structures when iron bacteria can be found in large quantities. Fire is not used in the process as is the case with limestone or wood ash cement, and so reduces fuel consumption. It may be an appropriate use for iron bacteria contaminated with mud that might otherwise be unsuitable for smelting. Aggregates such as sand and gravel could also be added to bulk out the volume. More experiments need to be made.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #Cement #Iron","title":"Primitive Technology: Iron Bacteria Cement (no fire/water insoluble)","duration":336,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230302","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9irICRnszOc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9irICRnszOc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1281743}}
