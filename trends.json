{"description":"THE MANDALORIAN SEASON 3 TRAILER BREAKDOWN!\nMan this was a great trailer. Let me first say, the show needs Cara Dune / Gina Carano back in it. Other than that, the trailer looked really good. I think this will be the best Mandalorian season yet. \nI can't wait to see more of Grogu's experience with Order 66 and how all the Mandalorians unite to fight against the remnants of the Empire. I wonder what happens to Moff Gideon and the dark saber, as it seems Mando Din Djarin doesn't have it on his belt anymore.\n\nThank you for watching today's video.

{"description":"Exploring Why This 17-Year Old's Electric Motor Is Important. Get Surfshark VPN at https://surfshark.deals/undecided - Enter promo code UNDECIDED for 83% off and 3 extra months for FREE!  Permanent magnets are a critical resource for renewables, because the generators in some wind turbines and motors in electric vehicles rely on them to run. A Floridian high school student has just shown us how to make a better electric motor without rare earth magnets. Another company is using cloud computing to try to improve electric motor performance — also without rare earths. There’s some exciting advances being made when it comes to electric motors, but how much of a difference can they make?\n\nCORRECTIONS: I've trimmed a couple of short sections from the video that were creating confusion.  I didn't mean to imply that AC motors use magnets, but the wording during some moments made it sound like I was.  Magnetless motors are not a new thing, but optimizing their design for high efficiency, high torque, without rare earths opens the door for more use cases.\n\nWatch How Can A Wind Turbine Be Motionless? https://youtu.be/OkRqVBpO2BQ?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7UWp64ZlOKUPNXePMTdU4d\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/why-this-17-year-olds-electric-motor-is-important/\n\nFollow-up podcast:\nVideo version - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-aWB84Bupf5hxGqrwYqLA\nAudio version - http://bit.ly/stilltbdfm\n\nJoin the Undecided Discord server:\nhttps://geni.us/undecided-discord\n\n👋 Support Undecided on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mattferrell\n\n\n⚙️ Gear & Products I Like\nTesla and smart home gear:\nhttps://kit.co/undecidedmf\n\nGreat sustainable products for your home:\nhttps://geni.us/buildwithrise\n\nUndecided Amazon store front:\nhttps://geni.us/undecidedAmazon\n\nFun, nerdy t-shirts:\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedShirts\n\nAbstract Ocean Tesla Accessories:\n15% Discount - Code: \"Undecided\"\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedAO\n\nJeda Tesla Wireless Charger/USB Hub:\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedJeda\n\nTesla Referral Code:\nGet 1,000 free supercharging miles \nor a discount on Tesla Solar & Powerwalls\nhttps://ts.la/matthew84515\n\nVisit my Energysage Portal:\nResearch solar panels and get quotes for free!\nhttp://www.energysage.com/p/undecided/\n\nOr find community solar near you:\nhttps://communitysolar.energysage.com/?rc=p-undecided\n\n\n👉 Follow Me\nTwitter \nhttps://twitter.com/mattferrell\nhttps://twitter.com/undecidedMF\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mattferrell\nhttps://www.instagram.com/undecidedmf\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/undecidedMF/\n\nWebsite\nhttps://undecidedmf.com\n\n\n📺 YouTube Tools I Recommend\nAudio file(s) provided by Epidemic Sound\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedEpidemic\n\nTubeBuddy\nhttps://www.tubebuddy.com/undecided\n\nVidIQ\nhttps://vidiq.com/undecided\n\n\nI may earn a small commission for my endorsement or recommendation to products or services linked above, but I wouldn't put them here if I didn't like them.

Which hotels were your favorite?\n\nA quick note - it looks like the Strat price title is missing, we paid $80 there on a Sunday!\n\nAlso, when we say \"Operated Independently\" - we mostly mean, not operated by MGM or Caesars!\n\nAlso also - we did receive some comped experiences at Treasure Island, Resorts World, and Circus Circus - but that did not influence our review and we did not promise them positive coverage. \n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nCarrie Roper\nMelissa Douglas\nClare Gelber\nJack Scott\nPhil Kinney\nElizabeth Pinotti\nMike Pearson III\nSteven Yonce\nGerman Torres\nCorey Glynn\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nRESEARCH by\nRachel Faulkner White \nSabrina Ford\n\n0:00 Intro\n2:56 Vegas Game Plan\n4:48 The Four Seasons\n8:04 The Delano\n10:01 Mandalay Bay\n12:57 The Luxor\n17:14 The Excalibur\n20:57 New York New York\n23:42 Park MGM\n25:23 The NoMad\n28:13 The Waldorf Astoria\n30:12 The Aria\n32:18 Bonus Hotel: Vdara\n32:47 The Cosmopolitan\n36:18 The Bellagio\n39:35 Caesars Palace\n41:06 The Nobu Hotel\n44:01 The Mirage\n46:27 Treasure Island\n48:58 Resorts World\n52:53 Circus Circus\n56:13 The Stratosphere\n\n#vegas #hotel #travel","title":"We Stayed At Every Hotel On The Vegas Strip","duration":3600,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e8woEkKmG8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0e8woEkKmG8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1492818}}

{"description":"We Survived Antarctica... The Ice Planet. this was insane. There is nothing but snow, ice, mountains, and rock. We tried living in the wilderness. It was not what we expected.\n\nCash App: https://cash.app\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dream\n\nMrBeast: @MrBeast \nKarl: @Karl \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nAfter years of being completely faceless online, I finally decided to do a face reveal, and after that my life completely changed. MrBeast took me to Antartica, and it was some of the craziest days of my life.\n\nAntarctica is nothing like anywhere else on earth. The sun never sets, the snow is deeper than you can dig, and the wind is hurricane-like at all times. You have to wear special gear to go outside, to avoid frostbite and also snow blindness. It felt like living on a different planet. The Ice Planet.\n\nAntarctica was incredibly cold, and surviving 50 hours in the wilderness was crazy. It was actually pretty fun, despite the fact I had 3 different illneses at the same time while I was there. I was constantly freezing and coughing, but I still managed to have fun. There were some scary moments, and lots of fun moments with my friends.\n\nBeing able to finally do this stuff in real life is awesome. I never would have thought in a million years that George, Sapnap and I would be traveling to Antarctica instead of filming another Minecraft Manhunt (maybe soon?!). I still want to do one in real life as well. Sorry for the lack of uploads!\n\nFun fact: Antarctica is the biggest desert on earth!\n\nMore Minecraft Survival soon... was kind of busy freezing...","title":"We Survived Antarctica...

The first game is my favourite of all time and I've bought the ps3 version, the ps4 remaster and even the ps5 remake that released a couple of months. This is a game I've completed numerous times on grounded mode and the series is something I've been desperate to do a deep dive on.\n\nThroughout this video we're gonna be breaking down the first episode scene by scene and talking about all the easter eggs, hidden details and what they did differently to the game. If you haven't played it then don't worry because we won't be spoiling what happens down the line as I want you to enjoy the twists and turns as much as I did on my first playthrough.\n\nHowever I may need to touch upon certain things due to characters that get name dropped here but I'll only bring them up in a spoiler section at the end of the video which I'll give you a heads up on.\n\ni'm nice like that\n\nNow unlike the game, the series starts off in 1968. Originally we watched as Sarah woke up in her bed and ventured about the house but here they do it differently. Rather than throwing us in at the night of the outbreak we get some backstory that wasn't even filled in in the source material. The game told us very little about the virus beyond it being cause by Cordyseps which had mutated to infect humans. These real life funghi exist in the jungle and the parasite infects insects and anthropods. Beginning in 1968 though we see a tv show in which two scientists do a big theory time about what the biggest threat to humanity is.\n\nThe first one goes off about how we may have a pandemic level event that's caused by a strain of influenza. Both games were made before Covid 19 and the creative team have kinda retroactively added this into the show to comment on it I think. The scientist mentions how airplanes are a new element that will help viruses like this spread easier and later on we see several planes flying overhead as Sarah, Joel and Tommy make their escape.\n\nThey add a lot of focus to them during the car scene and actually change up how the crash happens. Originally it was caused by another car hitting them but they do a fake out in the episode and instead have  plane debris causing it.","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 1 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":1960,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230116","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5XCOwFI9w8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5XCOwFI9w8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":383757}}

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Driving a 47' Trimaran Off The Dock\n02:58 Busted Mainsail & Leaving Charleston, SC \n05:27 Open Ocean Sailing NEEL 47\n07:11 Flashback Airport - Surfshark.deals/WYNNS \n08:36 How Well Does a 47' NEEL Trimaran Sail?\n11:06 Sunset, Full Sails & Moonlight\n14:23 Sunrise & Dramatic Weather Swing\n16:35 Genoa, Pour Over Coffee & Breakfast\n19:11 Challenges With the Sails\n23:01 Sailing With Dolphins\n24:59 Beautiful Night Sailing with the Stars\n26:48 Sailing into Saint Augustine FL\n28:56 40 knot Squall, Boat Life: EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED\n33:11 Difference Between Land Life and Boat Life\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats #sailing  \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2023","title":"NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED (rough start)","duration":2096,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20230115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8x0VG1E8E0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/S8x0VG1E8E0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":282967}}

{"description":"Roblox Combat Warriors is a fighting game where players use a variety of weapons to defeat their opponents.\n\nThis game is a free-for-all arena. After defeating another player, the victor and everyone who assisted in the kill get money that they can use to purchase abilities and better weapons.\n\nTo get money fast, you’ll need to be good at the game and learn the mechanics.\nParrying is essential in defeating the opponent. If a parry is successful, your opponent will be stunned for a few seconds which will result in a guaranteed frag. Other technics, such as sliding and super jump, will improve your odds of catching up and evading others, thus improving your KDA. For more advanced tips and tricks, please watch other tutorials since this video is a funny montage with edits.\n\nI had a pay 2 win moment and just bought the chainsaw and the dragon slayer. So I will have the max level weapons in the gameplay. This video is pre-update, so all the contents such as the new black hole disaster, Yoru heavy weapon and weapons skills that came after the update won't be in it because the video would have been too long.\n\nAfter playing alone for a while, I called in the boys to play together and ganked some people for fun. We chose to use fists because of its funny execution animation. After we got bored, we decided to raid the game with a Roman army for fun. \n\nWe managed to rally 30 people for the invasion all dressed up as Romans legionnaires. However, we would be constantly nuked and or hit with a missile shower. So after a while, we just decided to do a colosseum fight and a drafted versus Romans battle in a private server. \n\nI hope you enjoyed watching me and my friends play/raid this game. There were some codes for this game but I just P2W so I don't know about them. There were a lot of hackers using scripts but I cut those parts out. The disasters and other try hard sweats were a pain to deal with.\n\nBut still, it was still really fun game, I enjoyed it.\n\nLike always, this Roblox Combat Warriors video is filled with a crap ton of unfunny jokes and dead memes in the form of a montage/funny moments. I hope you enjoyed watching us fighting noobs and raiding them. Don’t forget to subscribe, like and comment E.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis video contains a crap load of dead memes and bad jokes.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”).

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"We Got the Tractor STUCK In the Yard - FULL Grain Cart of Soybeans","duration":1077,"channel_id":"UCp0rRUsMDlJ1meYAQ6_37Dw","author":"Millennial Farmer","date":"20230114","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klet1gS6K5o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Klet1gS6K5o/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":586208}}

{"description":"Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n\n_________FAQs__________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

{"description":"Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret. - Only in theaters April 28, 2023. Starring Rachel McAdams, Abby Ryder Fortson, Elle Graham, Benny Safdie, and Kathy Bates\n\nSubscribe to the LIONSGATE: YouTube Channel for the latest movie trailers, clips, and more:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2Z6nfym\n\nhttps://www.itsmemargaret.movie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/margaretmovie\nhttps://www.instagram.com/margaretmovie/\nhttps://twitter.com/margaretmovie\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@lionsgate\n\nFor over fifty years, Judy Blume’s classic and groundbreaking novel Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret. has impacted generations with its timeless coming of age story, insightful humor, and candid exploration of life’s biggest questions. In Lionsgate’s big-screen adaptation, 11-year-old Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) is uprooted from her life in New York City for the suburbs of New Jersey, going through the messy and tumultuous throes of puberty with new friends in a new school. She relies on her mother, Barbara (Rachel McAdams), who is also struggling to adjust to life outside the big city, and her adoring grandmother, Sylvia (Kathy Bates), who isn’t happy they moved away and likes to remind them every chance she gets. The film also stars Benny Safdie (Licorice Pizza, Good Time) and is written for the screen and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig (The Edge of Seventeen), based on the book by Judy Blume, and produced by Gracie Films’ Academy Award® winner James L. Brooks (Best Picture, 1983 – Terms of Endearment), alongside Julie Ansell, Richard Sakai, Kelly Fremon Craig, Judy Blume, Amy Lorraine Brooks, Aldric La’auli Porter, and executive produced by Jonathan McCoy.","title":"Are You There God?
