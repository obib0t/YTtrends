{"description":"A single curling stone certified for the Olympics costs over $600. That makes a full set of 16 stones worth $9,600. Since 2006, every stone used in the Olympic Winter Games has come from Kays of Scotland. The company has produced curling stones since 1851. But making these stones isn't easy. For every stone it makes, Kays uses granite from one tiny island off the coast of Scotland called Ailsa Craig. By combining Ailsa Craig's common green and blue hone granites, Kays produces the only stones allowed in World Curling Federation contests and the Winter Olympics.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE VIDEOS: \nWhy Oboes Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/_xOj9bLkYVQ\nWhy Chiso Kimonos Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/b3xOKlvlkHY\nWhy Honma Golf Clubs Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/HSMT5eZv7lA\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Olympics #Curling #Businessinsider\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\nBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcj\nBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29T\nBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGF\nBI on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBoot Camp on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Boot_Camp/3383377771\n\nWhy Olympic Curling Stones Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider","title":"Why Olympic Curling Stones Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider","duration":519,"channel_id":"UCcyq283he07B7_KUX07mmtA","author":"Business Insider","date":"20221015","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0GMaP0M6w0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0GMaP0M6w0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2697131}}

{"description":"Hey Guys! Today I am starting a new series (hopefully) where I paint or customize whatever I can win out of a claw machine. I finished my 3 part series a few weeks ago where I fully customized an entire claw machine. Now, I'm ready to fill it with prizes like accessories, squishies, plushies, tumblers, hats, bags and MYSTERY BAGS (ooooh!), so I have lots of options for customizing. What will I win this episode?!\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 27 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here.

Ok well by brand new I really mean that I took an existingly great format cultivated by @Dream   in minecraft and just hamfisted it into the skyrim together mod which has the netcode stability of crumbs. Today The Spiffing Brit will have to hunt down and assassinate 9 NPCs scattered across the holds of skyrim! However if any of the hunters manage to kill spiff that is it and the game is lost! If spiff manages to eliminate all NPCs (Including Nazeem) then he wins! However todays challenge is filled with twists, turns and crashes so who knows what wonderful skyrim multiplayer exploits will be discovered today!

{"description":"QUEEN rediscovered track featuring Freddie Mercury ‚ÄòFACE IT ALONE‚Äô arrives as digital single release Thursday October 13\nPrecedes arrival of Queen ‚ÄòThe Miracle Collector‚Äôs Edition‚Äô coming November 18 \n\nPre-order The Miracle-Collector's Edition: https://Queen.lnk.to/TheMiracle\nDownload/Stream Face It Alone: https://Queen.lnk.to/FaceItAlone\n\nHaving generated a media firestorm back in the summer when band members Brian May and Roger Taylor first leaked news of a rediscovered Queen song featuring Freddie Mercury being considered for possible release, the highly anticipated ‚Äòlost‚Äô track, ‚ÄòFace It Alone‚Äô, drops as a simultaneous worldwide single release Thursday 13 October, 11.15am BST.\n\nThe track‚Äôs existence was first revealed by May and Taylor in a BBC radio interview at their appearance at this year‚Äôs Royal Jubilee concert at which they performed the opening with their regular singer Adam Lambert, with Roger Taylor describing it as ‚Äúa little gem from Freddie that we‚Äôd kind of forgotten about‚Äù, with Brian May saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs beautiful, it‚Äôs touching.‚Äù\n\nThe track‚Äôs arrival as a single leads in a November 18 release of a new revisiting of the band‚Äôs 13th album, The Miracle, the band‚Äôs penultimate to be released in Freddie Mercury‚Äôs lifetime, which now becomes available in a lavish 8-disc Queen The Miracle Collector‚Äôs Edition box set format.\n\nAmong its contents, the expanded set includes The Miracle Sessions: an hour-plus disc of further previously unreleased recordings, including six unpublished songs. Just as tantalising for fans, the audio includes the band‚Äôs candid spoken exchanges on the studio floor in London and Montreux, giving the most revealing window yet into the four members‚Äô creative process and the joy, in-jokes and banter on their return to working together.\n\n‚ÄòFace It Alone‚Äô was originally recorded during the band‚Äôs historic 1988 sessions for that album, a prolific period which saw the band lay down around 30 tracks, many of which were never released, but remained among those that didn‚Äôt make the final album cut. It was rediscovered when the band‚Äôs production and archive team returned to those sessions to work on The Miracle box set reissue.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôd kind of forgotten about this track,‚Äù admits Roger Taylor, ‚Äúbut there it was, this little gem. It‚Äôs wonderful, a real discovery. It‚Äôs a very passionate piece‚Äù.\n\nThe single will be the first new song featuring Freddie Mercury released in over 8 years. On 2014‚Äôs Queen Forever album the band included three previously unheard tracks with Mercury, including ‚ÄòLet Me in Your Heart Again,‚Äô ‚ÄòLove Kills‚Äô and ‚ÄòThere Must Be More to Life Than This.‚Äô\n\nSpeaking of the rediscovered track, Brian May says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy that our team were able to find this track.  After all these years, it‚Äôs great to hear all four of us ‚Ä¶ yes, Deacy is there too ‚Ä¶ working in the studio on a great song idea which never quite got completed ‚Ä¶ until now!‚Äù\n\nSubscribe to the official Queen channel Here https://Queen.lnk.to/Subscribe\nWatch more: https://Queen.lnk.to/OfficialMusicVideos\n\nAbout Queen:\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.

Dakota and I were so excited to spend the weekend in California, and to be able to see all of our family and friends! We flew out on Wednesday, and spent the day prepping and hanging out before the chaos of everything. On Thursday it was time for our rehearsal and rehearsal dinner! We wanted to have things a little more casual than normal so we did a small get together with family and friends roasting s'mores and eating snacks!

While often associated with nuclear weapons and fallout, radiation is much more than the scary disasters we read about in the news. Simply put, radiation is just the transmission of energy through particles or waves through space or material mediums, meaning all the warmth, light, and colors you experience in this beautiful world are a direct result of radiation!\n\nI hope you enjoy this surface level dive into the topic of radiation, but please, if this topic interests you feel free to peruse a handful of the sources I used below: \n\nhttps://www.aocopm.org/assets/documents/10-31-11_Basic_Course_III_Orlando/ionizing%20an%20non.pdf\n\nhttps://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/UVB\n\nhttps://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/science-101/what-is-a-geiger-counter.html\n\nhttp://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/17793/1/DP70461.pdf\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\n\nhttps://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-electromagnetic-radiation-and-vs-nuclear-radiation/\n\nhttps://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/intro_9_5.html\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/training/products/RN/page4976.html\n\nhttps://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l3_p4.html\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome\n\nhttps://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html\n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-basics\n\nhttps://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Furman_University/CHM101%3A_Chemistry_and_Global_Awareness_(Gordon)/05%3A_Basics_of_Nuclear_Science/5.04%3A_Ionizing_Radiation_and_Non-ionizing_Radiation\n\nhttps://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Sacramento_City_College/SCC%3A_CHEM_330_-_Adventures_in_Chemistry_(Alviar-Agnew)/11%3A_Nuclear_Chemistry/11.06%3A_Penetrating_Power_of_Radiation\n\nhttps://www.mirion.com/learning-center/radiation-safety-basics/types-of-ionizing-radiation","title":"Radiation in a Nutshell","duration":882,"channel_id":"UCvQ4C0f9_OWRf1uyobwqOwA","author":"BlueJay","date":"20221011","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMuYohlRlfY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zMuYohlRlfY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":478410}}
