{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! This week we‚Äôre taking a 52-hour Amtrak sleeper train across the country! So, I've fallen over to the \"overnight sleeper train\" side of youtube - and I am HOOKED, people. And after watching hours and hours of train content, I decided - it was time to try my own hand at it. So we took the California Zephyr train, which travels from San Francisco to Chicago (and also the other direction as well) - across 7 states and over 2,400 miles!! We experienced everything from delays to endless sauce packets to MANY rock sightings. Would you try traveling across the US by train? And where do you think we should we go next? Or better yet, how should we get there?\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com \n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw \nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig \n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nExecutive Producers: Safiya Nygaard & Tyler Williams\nHead of Production: Carey Fiock\nProduction Manager / Producer: Melissa Douglas\nJunior Associate Producer: Ishara Mathews\nProduction Assistant: Aayanah McCreary\nContent Promotions & Video Packaging Manager: Alaina Simmons\nShort Form Producer: Myia Lambe\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Mandy Padgett\nAssistant Editor: Hailey Cox\nGraphic Designer: Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n1:50 All Aboard The California Zephyr!\n3:41 Our Room Tour\n5:27 A Tour Of The Entire Train!\n8:06 Day 1: Sacramento & Lunch\n10:56 Nevada & Dinner\n12:56 Setting Up Our Room for Sleeping\n14:39 Day 2: Mooning (?!) & Colorado\n17:07 Conquering The Shower \n18:53 The Good, The Bad, & The‚Ä¶Cows?\n21:11 The Moffat Tunnel (& The History of the Zephyr)\n23:15 Denver & Drinks\n25:28 Day 3: Omaha & Breakfast\n27:09 Our Final Destination: Chicago! \n29:28 Outro\n\n#train #travel #vlog","title":"I Took A 52-Hour Overnight Train Across America","duration":1783,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20231218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbooXnvsE8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ajbooXnvsE8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":622239}}

{"description":"The crew is back at @midamericaoutdoors for Travis Pastrana's final progression session along side Banks Hovey. As Travis awaits a full knee replacement in the coming days, he has decided to check one last item off his bucket list. Travis' goal is to back flip onto an elevated platform, do a nose bonk, then front flip out of the nose bonk back to his wheels. Banks plans to jump onto the platform, wheelie across, and backflip off. Both of these tricks have never been attempted, so come along for the ride as Nate Wessel and Hubert Rowland help Travis and Banks work through multiple ramp variations, distance measurements, platform angles, and injuries in an attempt to reach their goals.\n\nFollow Us:\nChannel 199 IG: https://www.instagram.com/channel199_/\nTravis IG: https://www.instagram.com/travispastrana/\nBRCC IG: https://www.instagram.com/blackriflecoffee/\nBRCC Motorsports IG: https://www.instagram.com/brcc_motorsports/\n\nShop Travis/BRCC: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/pages/travis-pastrana","title":"PASTRANA‚ÄôS FINAL SEND","duration":1006,"channel_id":"UCeikp7aPCip7YW9tCA3ilBg","author":"Channel 199","date":"20231217","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlv50fh7m_4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qlv50fh7m_4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":392532}}

{"description":"Paddy Pimblett's triumph over Tony Ferguson at UFC 296 unfolded as a captivating 15-minute spectacle, culminating in a decisive unanimous decision victory. Despite initial aspirations for an early finish, Pimblett's performance demonstrated a profound level of control and skill throughout the bout, leaving an indelible mark on the T-Mobile Arena. #UFC296 #tonyferguson #paddypimblett \n\nHailing from Liverpool, Pimblett showcased his striking prowess in the first round, where Ferguson resiliently weathered a barrage of attacks. The relentless pressure applied by Pimblett eventually resulted in a dramatic knockdown, prompting an eager pursuit of a finish on the canvas. Despite Ferguson's tenacious defensive maneuvers, Pimblett maintained unwavering control, showcasing a masterful display of ground-and-pound expertise.\n\nAs the fight progressed, Pimblett continued to assert his dominance on the ground, effectively fending off Ferguson's attempts from the bottom. Even as signs of fatigue surfaced in the third round, Pimblett executed yet another well-timed takedown, securing the win with a calculated flurry of punches.\n\nWith all three judges unanimously scoring the contest 30-27 in favor of Pimblett, he celebrated the hard-earned victory while acknowledging Ferguson's undeniable toughness. The match not only highlighted Pimblett's growth as he moved to an impressive 21-3 in his career but also raised questions about Ferguson's future in the sport as he faced his seventh consecutive defeat.\n\nClick here to Subscribe to our YouTube channel http://bit.ly/2quZwsz\n\nFollow My Twitter https://twitter.com/Keanutalksmma\n\nClick here to like our Facebook page \nhttps://bit.ly/2ZmykdU\n\nWatch our most recent video!\n\nThe electrifying atmosphere at T-Mobile Arena, characterized by the contrasting walkout songs and a divided crowd, added an extra layer of intensity to the lightweight bout. Pimblett's triumphant return to the Octagon after a year-long hiatus due to injuries underscored his resilience and marked a compelling comeback story. Meanwhile, Ferguson's struggles, despite his collaboration with fitness motivator David Goggins, raised further speculation about the trajectory of his career.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bout, Pimblett's victory stood as a testament to his evolving skill set and strategic prowess. The Liverpool native's calculated approach, coupled with his striking performance, showcased a fighter in the prime of his career.

Now all we need is some sails and we are ready to get wet.¬†¬†\n\nPlus, we reveal the completed installation of what has no doubt been the most debated piece of equipment of this entire boat building saga.\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I think building a new boat would be this much work.¬† And we‚Äôre not even the ones doing the labor.¬†\n\nOur days and nights are filled to the brim with decisions to be made, parts to be purchased and logistics to be planned (oh how I have NOT missed maritime bureaucracy).¬† The closer handover day gets, the more complicated the logistics seem to get.¬† Boat insurance for SE Asia looks expensive and potentially difficult to obtain.¬† We‚Äôre still searching for the port of least resistance to check into the Philippines and sailing out of China, well that is a whole other kettle of fish.¬†\n\nSo many adventures ahead with so many variables to plan for.¬† We have gained a boat load of knowledge over the past 2 years (much more than expected) and we still have soooo much more to learn.¬† We are fortunate HH Catamarans has been so open to letting us roam free in the yard, film without abandon and ask 1001 questions.¬†\n\nThank you so much for being a part of this untethered journey with us. ¬†It‚Äôs been a rollercoaster of a year, and I don‚Äôt expect 2024 will be anything less.¬† So, rest up, have the most wonderful holiday break and we will see you in the new year!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWE‚ÄôRE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe‚Äôve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we‚Äôre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Building a New Catamaran\n01:47 Buying a Dishwasher for a Sailboat\n04:09 Dishwasher Install on a Catamaran\n08:05 Our Electric Jet Tender\n11:14 Sea Trials of the ZeroJet OC Tender\n17:35 Incredible Chinese Seafood Restaurant \n19:55 China Package Delivery\n20:41 Installing the Mast on a Sailboat\n23:14 Interior and Cushion Designs\n24:35 Good End to an Untethered Year\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n¬© Gone With the Wynns 2023","title":"Biggest Argument Settled!

Thanks again to thredUP for sponsoring :)\n\nA Definitive Ranking of 2023 Pop Culture Moments\n\nmy new years resolution is to stop bringing up snap snap \n\nI can't believe it's already time for this video! This time last year we definitively ranked pop culture and meme moments from 2022 and I had a few of you ask for a 2023 version so here we are. Also thanks to everyone who has been sending stuff in over the past few weeks, really appreciate it :))  also x2 sorry if i sound quieter than usual i had the flu when i was recording this go easy on meeee thank u LOL and final also... (sorry) you prob noticed i had to try a different set up for filming this one, because this was a longer list and the tier size was going to change a lot i realized the easiest way to keep as much of it in view as possible was to ditch the green screen for this one so hope you dont mind!!!  \n\nOk SO after consulting you guys (and myself lol) i widdled down all the pop culture moments and memes that happened this year whether they were tik tok trends, twitter moments, celebrity pop culture stuff or other noteworthy events for us to rank today! We're talking the Josh Hutcherson whistle meme, Harry Styles going bald, Taylor Swift enjoying seemingly... ranch? The Pedro Pascal renaissance on Tiktok,  the \"girly teen girl\" twitter debate, Lana Del Rey working at waffle house and tons of other stuff too. \n\nLike I mentioned in the video this list isn't exhaustive, because my tier names are the way they are there are some things that just flat out do not make sense to rank within it lol so hope that's understandable! As always with these videos though while the ranking is definitive for me it doesn't have to be for you! Feel free to share your ranking in the comments i love seeing them :)) ALSO IF ANY OF YALL HAVE SEEN THOSE MONKEYS ON TIKTOK PLEEEEEEASE TELL ME I FEEL LIKE IM GOING CRAZY NONE OF MY IRLS HAVE SEEN THEM LMAO \n\nAnd ofc!!! hope you guys have a good holiday!! This time of the year can get super hectic and stressful so hope you're taking care of yourself. this past year on the internet has been so fun with yall and i seriously cant thank u enough for it i feel like a cornball when i try to explain it but i hope you know i feel really lucky and happy to have you guys, see you in the new year :) \n\nok i'll wrap it up lol if you liked the video feel free to give it like and subscribe to the channel it really helps me out :) you can also turn on my post notifications if you want to be notified every time I upload but otherwise, hope you guys enjoy and I'll see you in the comments!!\n\n//Other videos you might like\n\nExploring the World of ‚ÄúJobless‚Äù Celebrities\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Pk9ecXYHY\n\nExploring the Insane World of Colleen Hoover (Part 1)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IatKojHB5KE \n\nExploring the World's Messiest Pop Star: Justin Bieber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpmaMz3ilbE\n\nExploring 2013 Pop Culture...

{"description":"In the opening round of the 2023 PNC Championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods carded a combined 8-under 64.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PNC Championship is held for the 26th time this week as the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hosts 20 two-player teams featuring a PGA TOUR, Champions Tour or LPGA player and one of their family members. After Tiger Woods made his return to action at the Hero World Challenge for the first time since withdrawing at the Masters, he‚Äôll once again be back to tee it up at the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie. The duo was tied for second a year ago after the first round, but stalled on Sunday and ended up tied for eighth. Justin Thomas returns this year to play alongside his father, Mike.  Justin Thomas finished third at the Hero World Challenge two weeks ago and will be feeling confident about taking his second PNC Championship title, as the Thomases won here in 2020. Defending champions Vijay Singh and his son Qass are looking to recreate their magic from 2022. Last year was their 16th time teeing it up together at this event, and they finally broke through for a win, becoming the first pair to shoot two sub-60 rounds at the event. Other pairings to look out for are Nelly Korda and her father Petr, Matt Kuchar and his elder son Cameron, and Bernhard Langer and his son Jason.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Tiger and Charlie Woods shoot 8-under 64 | Round 1 | PNC Championship | 2023","duration":492,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20231216","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXHgVesf1xE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cXHgVesf1xE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":655692}}

{"description":"Kung Fu Panda 4 - In Theaters March 8\n\nThis spring, for the first time in almost a decade, comedy icon Jack Black returns to his role as Po, the world‚Äôs most unlikely kung fu master, with a hilarious, butt-kicking new chapter in DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs beloved action-comedy franchise: Kung Fu Panda 4. \n\nAfter three death-defying adventures defeating world-class villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills, Po, the Dragon Warrior (Golden Globe nominee Jack Black), is called upon by destiny to ‚Ä¶ give it a rest already. More specifically, he‚Äôs tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace.\n\nThat poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. \n\nEven worse, there‚Äôs been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (Oscar¬Æ winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Po‚Äôs Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. \n\nSo, Po‚Äôs going to need some help. He finds it (kinda?) in the form of crafty, quick-witted thief Zhen (Golden Globe winner Awkwafina), a corsac fox who really gets under Po‚Äôs fur but whose skills will prove invaluable. In their quest to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleon‚Äôs reptilian claws, this comedic odd-couple duo will have to work together. In the process, Po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places. \n\nThe film features the voice talent of returning stars Academy Award¬Æ winner Dustin Hoffman as Kung Fu master, Shifu; James Hong (Everything Everywhere All at Once) as Po‚Äôs adoptive father, Mr. Ping; Academy Award¬Æ nominee Bryan Cranston as Po‚Äôs birth father, Li, and Emmy Award nominee Ian McShane as Tai Lung, Shifu‚Äôs former student and arch-nemesis. Oscar¬Æ winner Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All at Once) joins the ensemble as a new character, Han, the leader of the Den of Thieves. \n \nKung Fu Panda 4 is directed by Mike Mitchell (DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs Trolls, Shrek Forever After) and produced by Rebecca Huntley (DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs The Bad Guys). The film‚Äôs co-director is Stephanie Ma Stine (She-Ra and the Princesses of Power). In 2008, the Academy Award¬Æ-nominated 2008 inaugural chapter, Kung Fu Panda, became DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs highest-grossing original animated film and launched a franchise that has earned more than $1.8 billion at the global box-office.\n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/kungfupanda \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kungfupanda \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.kungfupanda.com\n#KungFuPanda","title":"KUNG FU PANDA 4 | Official Trailer","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_inKs4eeHiI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_inKs4eeHiI/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":16562738}}

This time, it has affected my eye. \n\nEach time I was exposed and had a bad reaction, I was given prednisone. It got to the point where, after I was exposed, the effects of the poison ivy wouldn‚Äôt go away after using prednisone.\n\nPeople typically take prednisone for its anti-inflammatory or immune suppressant effects. But, prednisone has side effects. \n\nPrednisone is a synthetic version of cortisol. Cortisol has benefits. It‚Äôs a hormone that helps the immune system and prepares the body for stress. But, high cortisol levels can lead to a lot of health concerns. \n\nYou don‚Äôt want to be on prednisone forever. The more you take it, the more it weakens the system. But, if you stop taking it, your symptoms may come back. So, why don't we get to the root problem? Keep in mind that once you start taking prednisone, it‚Äôs important not to come off of it too fast. Prednisone and cortisol also deplete the body of numerous vitamins and minerals. \n\nThe best ways to lower cortisol: \n1. Lower your stress (do physical work, exercise, spend more time on a hobby, and take certain nutrients)\n2. Take ashwagandha \n3. Try breathing exercises \n4. Use an HRV device to better understand your stress\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 58, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis and intermittent fasting.

Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and his stoically ever-professional captain, Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher), along with their diverse, lovable colleagues as they police the NYPD's 99th Precinct. In this final season of the series, Jake and the squad must try to balance their personal lives and their professional lives over the course of a very difficult year.\n\nRounding out the ensemble is Sgt. Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumera), who has a passion for organization and a weakness for dork dancing; Lt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), a mountain of a man whose most powerful muscle is his sweetheart; Jake's best friend and human puppy dog, Det. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio); and the incredibly secretive, tough-as-nails Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). Also part of the Nine-Nine are veteran officers Det. Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) and Det. Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker), whose only skill as police officers is their ability to make a passable pot of coffee.\n\nCreated by Emmy Award-winning writer/producers Dan Goor and Michael Schur, \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" won the 2014 Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series - Comedy or Musical and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Comedy or Musical (Samberg). Emmy winner Braugher earned four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as Capt. Holt.\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/NBCBrooklyn99\n\n#brooklynninenine","title":"A Tribute To Andre Braugher - Our Favorite Holt Moments","duration":487,"channel_id":"UCtRa82x1BwQdnpHf0Es4gcQ","author":"Brooklyn Nine-Nine","date":"20231213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib8fl7KrUC4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ib8fl7KrUC4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1310406}}
{"description":"Ashley Pointer | December 13, 2023\n\"I grew up playing classical music and it's so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamber-like setting,\" Laufey says in her performance. Accompanied by a string quartet, the singer-songwriter's modern jazz-pop love songs soared at the Tiny Desk, the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact.\n\nLaufey's music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger, mainstream audiences coming to the genre. Her sophomore album, Bewitched, broke Spotify's all-time streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platform's history and resulted in her first Grammy nomination. She opens the set with \"From The Start,\" a bouncy, whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend, connecting Chet Baker-like scats with charming and playful lyrics. Taking a more melancholic turn into 2021's \"Let You Break My Heart Again\" and \"Promise,\" her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings, creating a symphony of emotions. Laufey concludes the set with \"California and Me,\" which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by Liszt and Chopin. This mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and music's ability to evoke raw, unfiltered emotion.\n\nSET LIST\n\"From The Start\"\n\"Let You Break My Heart Again\"\n\"Promise\"\n\"California and Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLaufey J√≥nsd√≥ttir: piano, guitar, vocals\nSherri Zhang: violin\nJosh Henderson: violin\nAria Cheregosha: viola\nKen Kubota: cello\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Ashley Pointer\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nAudio Assistant: Neil Tevault\nProduction Assistant: Elle Mannion\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #laufey","title":"Laufey: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1147,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20231213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avjI3_GIZBw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/avjI3_GIZBw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1093414}}

{"description":"The Airbus A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007. When it debuted, it overtook the long reigning Boeing 747 as the world‚Äôs biggest passenger plane. It has four engines and is a full double-decker that can carry over 800 people depending on the airline.\n\nThe plane‚Äôs huge number of seats was seen as key in helping to free up the air traffic overcrowding at several big airports such as London‚Äôs Heathrow, New York‚Äôs JFK and Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare.\nBut orders for four engine aircraft began to decline alongside the arrival of more fuel-friendly planes such as Airbus‚Äôs own A350 and Boeing‚Äôs 787 Dreamliner.\n\nThe European plane maker Airbus announced an end to its A380 superjumbo program just 12 years after it first took to the skies. During the Covid-19 pandemic it was one of the most heavily impacted fleets due to its sheer size and cost to operate it, along with a near-halt to international long-haul travel. Many said it was the end for superjumbos, but the A380 has been making a comeback with several airlines pulling planes out of retirement.\n\nAirbus expects the A380 to be flying for the next two decades and is currently still being operated by 10 airlines including Emirates, Lufthansa, Etihad Airways and British Airways.\nCNBC explores how the A380 became the biggest passenger plane in the world and what the future looks like for the massive jet.\n\nChapters:\n 2:44 Development \n6:32 Commercial service\n9:53 Challenges  \n11:33 The future \n\nProduced, shot and edited by Erin Black\nAdditional Camera by Maggie Petrova\nAnimation by Gene Kim\nSupervising Producer Jeniece Pettitt\nEditorial Support by Leslie Josephs\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
