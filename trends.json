{"description":"The rule is simple, when Steph Curry is in transition, you keep an eye on him at all times, even when he gives the ball up, because as we stop it right here, you already know that he‚Äôs going to curl and relocate out at the three point line, get the ball back, fire away and swish it.\nAnd this is just a death sentence, as Curry is lurking from behind, and all 3 Celtics are pointing but nobody picks up the deadliest shooter that this league has ever seen, so he raises up from the finals logo and literally announces to the entire arena that he‚Äôs going to get his 4th ring.\nSteph was unstoppable once again, but for this close out win, Golden State did something special, something that Boston could not find an answer for.\nLet me break down exactly how they won the championship. What up everybody, my name is Stefan and this is Heat Check. Let‚Äôs get into it.\nNo other player in the league has this much power and you know the fear is immeasurable just by looking at these fly bys as soon as he even blinks with his eyes, the overreaction to it is crazy, yet it totally makes sense.\nSo as a side effect of having to be that close to Steph, he uses it to penetrate inside and look at how easy this looks. \nJust saying that he had another spectacular game with 34 points 7 rebounds 7 assists on 57% from the field doesn‚Äôt do him justice, he could not be stopped. This looks like a walk in the park for him.\nBut just as impressive in this game was the fight that he showed on the defensive end.\nEarly on Boston tried to go at him and post him up in the paint, but he held his ground and as you can see, some of those possessions did not end well for the Celtics.\nESPN had a stat comparing his production on both ends of the floor. And it looks impressive as you can see. On defense he gave up 10 points as the primary guy and the Celtics shot 3 for 12 on those possessions, a miserable 25% along with 6 turnovers.\nThen we got Draymond Green. Check out how he baited the defense here by asking for the screen for Steph, and this should be a hand off but as Klay cuts inside, watch the laser pass in traffic right on the money and Thompson lays it in. Amazing.\nThen, these are the little things, the championship level plays, of sticking with it and tapping it out, subsequently leading to a three pointer. These are extra points.\nAnd he did it again as you can see this is a similar situation, and as he grabs the offensive rebound, finds Poole once again for another three.\nDraymond was even more imposing on defense. Look at the effort right here to stay in front of Jayson Tatum, and as soon as Looney comes out to help right here, Green will rotate over to switch it, doing it so quickly that he snatches this pass, and takes off on a fast break.\nAnd his blocks were even crazier.\nDraymond played by far his best game of the finals series, almost getting a triple double with 12 points, 12 rebounds, 8 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks. He was literally all over the floor and this was one of his vintage performances when the team needed it the most.\nAnd as you can see most of these plays are based on energy and effort.\nThat was the case as well with Andrew Wiggins who had another monster 2 way game, contributing on offense while pretty much shutting down Jayson Tatum on the other end of the floor. Wiggins has completely flipped the narrative about himself in a positive way of course, and I‚Äôm really happy for him.\nAnd what I said about energy and effort for both Green and Wiggins, this was the case for the entire Golden State team, and actually this was the one special thing that Boston couldn‚Äôt find an answer for. Which is staggering to me.\nEven tho they were bigger, the Celtics got outrebounded and gave away 15 offensive boards, which you can see how that contributed to extra possessions and points for the Warriors.\nNot only that, but Golden State‚Äôs activity and aggressiveness on defense forced 22 turnovers from Boston.\nIme Udoka‚Äôs squad did come out strong to start the game but as soon as the Warriors withstood that initial run, they went on a 21-0 blitz, built a big lead and they pretty much didn‚Äôt look back all the way to the final buzzer and the championship.\nSpeaking of that, this is an incredible storyline. Steph finally gets that finals MVP trophy that he deserved in 2015, and to shut all the haters who were saying that this is 1 thing that he‚Äôs missing in his career. And to say that for a guy that literally changed the game is ridiculous. But nevertheless he got it. And still puts the team first.\nThen Klay- after missing 2 and a half years to the most difficult injuries that a basketball player can have, and literally crying on the bench after games, to becoming a champion, that's a true dream of a comeback.\nAnd on the Boston side of things, first of all, this was a massive success beyond anyone‚Äôs expectations. With a new coach, and those early struggles, the talks about breaking up their star duo, to game 6 of the finals is nothing short of amazing.","title":"THIS Is EXACTLY How Boston Lost The Championship","duration":490,"channel_id":"UCmwxBk7Af9OnnloGZzp6JnQ","author":"Heat Check","date":"20220617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5KQ6J7UYT8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a5KQ6J7UYT8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":440655}}

{"description":"America has experienced at least 30 recessions throughout history, dating back as early as 1857. Some experts believe that they have become an inevitable part of the economic cycle that fluctuates between periods of expansion and contraction. Nonetheless, certain measures can still be taken to make recessions less likely. As the nation‚Äôs authority on monetary policies, the Federal Reserve plays a critical role in managing recessions. So why do recessions happen and what can the Fed do about it? Watch the video to find out.\n\nThe U.S. has experienced at least 30 recessions throughout history, dating back as early as 1857.\n\nSome economists argue that they may have become an inevitable part of the financial cycle that fluctuates between periods of expansion and contraction.\n\n‚ÄúHistory teaches us that recessions are inevitable,‚Äù said David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution. ‚ÄúI think there are things we can do with a policy that makes recessions less likely or when they occur, less severe. We‚Äôve learned a lot, but we haven‚Äôt learned enough to say that we‚Äôre never going to have another recession.‚Äù\n\nAs the nation‚Äôs authority on monetary policies, the Federal Reserve plays a critical role in managing recessions.\n\nThe Fed is currently attempting to avoid a recession by engineering what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúsoft landing,‚Äù in which incremental interest rate hikes are used to curb inflation without pushing the economy into recession.\n\n‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôre trying to do is raise rates enough so demand slows,‚Äù said Jason Snipe, chief investment officer at Odyssey Capital Advisors.\n\nBut a successful soft landing is extremely rare as the monetary policy needed to slow down the economy is often enforced too late to make any meaningful impact.\n\nIt was arguably achieved just once, in 1994, thanks to the Fed‚Äôs more proactive response to inflation and good timing.\n\n‚Ä≥[It‚Äôs] really, really difficult to get into that really, really narrow zone,‚Äù said Stephen Miran, former senior advisor at the U.S. Department of Treasury. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the difference between trying to land an airplane in a really wide and spacious open field versus trying to land an airplane on a very, very narrow piece of land with rocks and water on either side.‚Äù\n\nSome experts also argue that policies have a limitation on what they can achieve against an impending downturn.\n\n‚ÄúPolicy tends to operate with long lags, which means the ability to effect immediate change in the economy is quite slow. I also think that increasingly we live in a global economy where the cross-currents that are impacting the economic dynamics are very complex,‚Äù said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer, wealth management at Morgan Stanley.\n\n‚ÄúThese are dynamics that the Fed doesn‚Äôt have the tools to address and so to a certain extent, we do think that policymakers have certainly developed more tools to fight recessions,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt think that you can rely on policymakers to prevent recessions‚Äù\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

{"description":"Used Vipers now cost the same as new GT3s. \n\nThe 2022 Porsche 911 GT3 Touring ($228,000 as specced in Canada, ~$180,000 USD converted) and the Dodge Viper GTS ($132,890 when new in Canada, ~$102,570 USD converted) are two absurdly riotous sports cars. A gruesome 8.4L V10 powers the Viper, pushing out 640 pure American horsepower and 600 lb ft of raw torque. The 4.0 L flat-six in the Porsche GT3 Touring screams its way to 9000 rpm, making 502 hp and 347 lb ft of torque - all while singing its own version of the German national anthem. Each car brings something unique to the table; Thomas and James are eager to see what makes each of these cars special. We hope you enjoy the episode! Thanks for watching!

Sony‚Äôs new version of its subscription service now offers three tiers: Essential, Extra, and Premium.\n\nIf you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Sony‚Äôs new subscription service play, you may be wondering: Is this PlayStation‚Äôs version of Xbox‚Äôs Game Pass? No, and, well, sort of. The higher-priced tiers do offer a catalog of new and classic games for subscribers, much like Xbox‚Äôs service. However, Sony has said it doesn‚Äôt plan to add new, first-party releases to PlayStation Plus the day they come out ‚Äî a major Game Pass perk. The PlayStation Plus Essential tier is the version of PS Plus that‚Äôs existed for years. Subscribers will get access to monthly games, multiplayer access, discounts, exclusive content, cloud storage, share play, the PlayStation Plus Collection, game help, and free shipping from PlayStation. As it has been, a month will run players $9.99, a year is $59.99.\n\nThe PlayStation Plus Extra tier ($14.99 monthly/$99.99 yearly) is the enhanced version of the Essential tier. It comes with all the Essential features and only adds a game catalog of 400 first and third-party PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that subscribers can access ‚Äî although selections will likely rotate in and out as the months go by.\n\nThe PlayStation Plus Premium tier ($17.99 monthly/$119.99 yearly) is the most enhanced version of PlayStation Plus and the most expensive. It comes with all the features in both Essential and Extra. It also adds a classic catalog of PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games, game trials for certain titles, and PlayStation 3 cloud streaming games.\n\nAs for the classic games emulation, American players are getting a better deal than other regions. When PlayStation started rolling out Premium in Asian territories a few months ago, its classic emulators were running the 50 Hz PAL versions of the game. However, in North America the titles are reportedly running the 60 Hz versions ‚Äî which, practically speaking, means they‚Äôll run faster for American players.","title":"The new PlayStation Plus is CRAZY!

{"description":"In the final round of the 2022 RBC Canadian Open, Rory McIlroy shot an 8-under 62 to get to 19-under par and win his 21st PGA TOUR title by two shots.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nRory McIlroy will look to defend his title this weekend, as the PGA TOUR returns to St George‚Äôs Golf and Country Club for the RBC Canadian Open. The course last hosted the tournament in 2010 when Carl Pettersson was victorious. Three years ago, Northern Irishman McIlroy beat the course record to claim victory finishing seven shots clear of second place. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will be looking for a fifth victory this year, having narrowly missed out on another first place finish last weekend in a tense playoff with Sam Burns at the Charles Schwab Challenge. Other notable players teeing up include 2022 PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas, THE PLAYERS Championship winner Cameron Smith as well as Tony Finau, Justin Rose and Tyrell Hatton.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Rory McIlroy's 8-under 62 and 21st victory | Round 4 | RBC Canadian | 2022","duration":365,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20220612","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kllJCMZTqdg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kllJCMZTqdg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":461606}}
