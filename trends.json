{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. \n\nAs a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history. \n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT \nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n \nVideo Director: Oliver Murray\nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton\nOriginal score: Paul Englishby\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists\nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup\nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter\n\nStream The Beatles:\n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Appl...\n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify\n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Amaz...\n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora\n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal\n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer\n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouT...\n \nFollow The Beatles:\n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com\n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"Now And Then – The Last Beatles Song (Short Film Trailer)","duration":35,"channel_id":"UCc4K7bAqpdBP8jh1j9XZAww","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgFTpwB_uII","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KgFTpwB_uII/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":943488}}

Check out the official trailer for the new season of Raising Kanan, premiering Friday December 1st on STARZ.\n\n#PowerNeverEnds #STARZ\n\nSubscribe to the STARZ YouTube Channel for more Power: http://bit.ly/1kalhP0\n\nLike Raising Kanan on Facebook: https://bit.ly/3aCYxuE\nFollow Raising Kanan on Twitter:  https://bit.ly/3xqd9qV\nFollow Raising Kanan on Instagram: https://bit.ly/3vmiVrX\n\nFacebook: http://starz.tv/STARZFacebookYT\nTwitter: http://starz.tv/STARZTwitterYT\nInstagram: http://starz.tv/STARZInstagramYT\nYouTube: https://starz.tv/STARZYouTube\nTikTok: https://starz.tv/STARZTikTokYT\n\nOver the last two seasons of “Raising Kanan,” Kanan Stark has slowly learned the truth\nabout not only his mother, but also himself. It has been a tortuous journey for him and\neveryone around him. With each new revelation, Kanan has been forced to confront his\nfamily’s seemingly never-ending web of secrets and lies. He has spent much of this time\nin a state of denial, but now, Kanan’s blinders are finally off, and he doesn’t like what he\nsees. In season three, Kanan finds himself grappling with the very notions of right and\nwrong. Good and evil. Fidelity and disloyalty. And he’s not alone. Every member of the\nThomas family must confront an existential crisis that challenges their very identity.\nWhether it’s Marvin, who’s still trying to redeem himself, or Raq, who’s finally coming\nclean, or Lou, who’s wrestling with his own evil, or Jukebox, who’s simply trying to break\nfree from her family’s pathology, they are all attempting to redefine and reinvent themselves. They won’t all be able to complete this intensely personal quest, but for those who do, the destination may reveal the most terrifying secret of all. There is no right and wrong or good and evil. There are no absolutes. In the end, there’s just you.","title":"Power Book III: Raising Kanan | Season 3 Official Trailer | STARZ","duration":133,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20231026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3sgm-buSJo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/x3sgm-buSJo/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1969643}}

Recognizing the unending loyalty of my furry best friend, we've embarked on an epic DIY adventure, showcasing the ultimate dog house build you have to see to believe. From a custom-designed rock wall, personal elevator, and an exclusive puppy pool to a top-notch entertainment system and gourmet kitchen, this two-story doggy haven sets a new standard in pet care. It's not just a dog house; it's a statement of the bond we share with our pets, blending comfort, luxury, and a dog's dream living space. But there's more! While we were immersed in this unique pet home construction, my sister took on a heartfelt task: giving our dog the most unforgettable day, filled with fun visits to his favorite spots like the local dog park and pet store, ensuring every moment was packed with happiness, play, and of course, his favorite treats. This is more than a typical 'building a dog house' scenario; it's a blend of creativity, luxury living for pets, and a celebration of the human-dog bond that viewers searching for dog care, luxury pet living, and epic DIY projects will not want to miss. We've tackled every challenge with determination, driven by the goal to see that wagging tail go into overdrive. Wait until you see the grand reveal at the end of this journey, capturing the priceless moment my dog sets paws into his luxury mansion for the first time. For anyone who loves dogs, enjoys creative pet care content, and believes in pampering their furry friends, this video is a must-watch.

Designed by Peerutin Karol, this home in Cape Town’s swishest beach destination pays homage to mid-century modernist architecture. Now you have the chance to make yourself at home in Africa’s finest futuristic masterpiece, where urban living blends with nature and time stands still.\n‍\nThis sculptural home captures the zeitgeist of Hollywood’s jet-set era, drawing every bit of allure and drama out of its 270-degree vistas of the Atlantic Seaboard.\nSpread over four levels (accessed via two elevators or a spiral staircase), this home in Cape Town’s most desirable address is perfect for gatherings of friends and families with teens. It has entertainment areas aplenty; an extensive home spa with an indoor heated swimming pool, sauna, steam room, and Jacuzzi; a home theatre; a home relaxation pavilion worthy of James Bond, with a sunken bar, barbecue areas, and rim-flow swimming pool; digital-games set-up; large open-plan living area with uninterrupted ocean views, long dining table, sleek kitchen-cum-bar area (plus a behind-the-scenes prep kitchen), all of which flow onto the lawn, outdoor barbecue area and the pavilion. The luxurious bedroom suites on the top floor are private sanctuaries, each with panoramic views and total privacy. Two separate bedroom pods above the entertainment pavilion are perfect for guests seeking extra independence.’’\n\nEnes: https://www.instagram.com/enesyilmazer/\nEnes on Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@enesyilmazerla\nMikey’s Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/ayersworld/\n\nCamera Gear used in the Video and Edit:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/enesyilmazer?listId=1OXA45Y91M6J7\n\nMy favorite books:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/enesyilmazer?listId=2XTUW13ZX2HL7\n\nRoyalty-free music we use in our videos:\nEpidemic (Free 30 day trial): https://bit.ly/3GRsjtl\nArtlist (2 Extra Months Free): https://bit.ly/3p2k9YZ\n\nStock Footage: https://bit.ly/3E1QxiB\nMotion Graphics: https://bit.ly/3skGrqX\n\nOnline course I used to get my Real Estate License:\nhttps://trk.realestateexpress.com/?a=13808&c=158&p=r&s1=\n\n#MansionTour #ModernMansion #LuxuryHomeTour #SouthAfrica #CapeTown #IronManHouse\n\nCreated by Enes Yilmazer - @EnesYilmazer\nFilmed by @AyersWorld , @Ermanalkis , Joe Russ\nEdited by @Create.james , @AyersWorld, @Jaysonk0312 , @Luis__f\n\nTime Codes:\n00:00 Introduction\n02:44 Main Floor & Great Room\n04:52 Specs & Kitchen \n06:57 Dining Room & Backyard\n09:31 The Design\n11:23 Backyard & Infinity Edge Pool\n14:08 Pool Deck & Bar\n15:33 Pool House\n18:02 Entry & Garage \n21:15 Bar & Screening Room\n22:13 Indoor Pool & Spa\n23:21 Glass Bridge & 2 Guest Suites\n25:12 Guest Living Room & Kitchen\n27:22 The Region\n29:00 Office & JR Primary Bedroom\n31:06 Primary Bedroom\n33:57 Sunset Tour\n35:05 - Night Tour\n36:44 Outro","title":"Touring the IRON MAN House!","duration":2240,"channel_id":"UCHWbZM3BIGgZksvXegx_h3w","author":"Enes Yilmazer","date":"20231023","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1t8Orjt7lk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1t8Orjt7lk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":942731}}

{"description":"Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton’s best weekend of 2023 ended in the worst possible outcome. Their strongest challenge against Red Bull and Max Verstappen yet ended in a disqualification for a rare breach of a near-30-year-old rule - with Ferrari falling foul of this as well. \nRed Bull was checked, hadn’t made the same mistake - and therefore Verstappen’s victory stood. Conversely Hamilton was stripped of his second place at the United States GP just a few hours after chasing Verstappen closely in his upgraded Mercedes in easily his and the team’s most competitive showing of the season, while Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc got excluded from sixth place at the same time. \nTheir cars breached the same technical regulation that refers to the thickness of the plank assembly under the car, with a minimum thickness of 9mm accepted after a competitive session due to wear.\nIt put a dampener on a much improved weekend for Mercedes even if there were a few factors behind dominant world champion Verstappen almost suffering a rare defeat. \n\n00:00 Exclusions\n01:57 How Ferrari and Mercedes got caught out\n03:26 Why only four cars were checked\n05:28 How Red Bull avoided trouble\n07:55 What about Mercedes' upgrade?\n\nSubscribe: http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe\nWebsite: http://the-race.com/\nTwitter: @wearetherace\nInstagram: @wearetherace\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/wearetherace\nPodcasts: http://the-race.com/podcasts\n\nThanks for watching - please like, share and comment, please also hit subscribe to show your support so we'll keep doing what we're doing.\n\nhttps://www.the-race.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/wearetherace\n\n#f1 #f1news #USGP #f12023 #mercedes #ferrari #redbull #lewishamilton #charlesleclerc #maxverstappen #hamilton #leclerc #verstappen #fia #rules #excluded #disqualified #disqualification #austin #texas #formula1 #formulaone #grandprix #therace","title":"How Red Bull avoided USGP error that got Hamilton and Leclerc excluded","duration":605,"channel_id":"UCaTxfj0BzL-MaCy-YUqPRoQ","author":"THE RACE","date":"20231023","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBAhkdSsVOQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wBAhkdSsVOQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGBMgVSh_MA8=&rs=AOn4CLBEu3Wzc6A1P1CsTlPTT3Y51Zv9gw","content":{"View count":641471}}

{"description":"Could we buy some land and build a tiny home? Get healthy - go to http://drinkAG1.com/kingingit \n\nLast week we started the hunt for the house of our dreams. We had initially thought we wanted a home already built for us to renovate.  But since viewing properties for sale in the highlands but not finding exactly what we were looking for, we thought it would be worth exploring a selection of different builds. \nWe asked ourselves, could we buy land? Could we build our own house? Then we met friends who owned a campsite and wondered what owning that would look like?\nThis week we head to West wales to view two more amazing properties and visit  @CampOutWest   - couple Emilie and Jon that are hoping to build their campground with a veg patch and live sustainably and live off grid. We see if building a campsite/ tiny home/ air bnb/ glamping site might be an option.\n\nWALES Google Maps - https://www.kinging-it.com/maps\n\n🚗 Top 10 videos to watch on Kinging-it’s channel:\nWATCH HERE! - http://bit.ly/3uHC5sy\n\n➡️👫 A bit about US- \nWe are Craig and Aimee, from South Wales, UK.
