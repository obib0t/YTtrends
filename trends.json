{"description":"Anamaria Sayre | May 15, 2023\nArriving at the Tiny Desk not long after becoming the first female artist to have a Spanish-language album top the Billboard 200 chart, Colombian singer Karol G shined brighter than ever. With an all-female crew backing her, the proud energia femenina and the prowess of a band dominated exclusively by women is undeniably brilliant here. It was also the first time in many years, she said, that she hadn't rehearsed without her typical on-stage equipment, like in-ear monitors. \"I forgot how cool it feels,\" she said. Authenticity isn't a prescription for Karol G, it's a natural state — something that she carries with her, waiting for the next opportunity to reveal another version of Carolina.\n\n\"CAROLINA,\" her given name, was also the title of the opening track of her performance, as she got to jamming in a manner atypical for the superstar. Trading her flute and trumpet for an accordion and tuba she \"bring[s] some Mexican vibe to this place,\" she said, with \"GUCCI LOS PAÑOS.\" She paused between songs and offered a cheers to the room, admitting that she had meant to sip her Mezcalito before the previous song.\n\nShe emphasized the rawness of the moment by slowing things down for a stripped down, reggae-leaning version of \"PERO TÚ.\" Sliding seamlessly into a bossa nova-esque \"MERCURIO\" — the version she wishes she'd included on the album — \"La Bichota\" brought the music back up and danced herself off stage. Away from the stadium lights, Karol G's performance wasn't just a blip of normalcy for the pop star — it was permission from the self-described \"happy-heartbreak girl\" to get up, whether in the streets of Medellín or an office in Washington, D.C., and dance with every version of yourself.\n\nSET LIST\n\"CAROLINA\"\n\"GUCCI LOS PAÑOS\"\n\"PERO TÚ\"\n\"MERCURIO\" \n\nMUSICIANS\nCarolina Giraldo (Karol G): vocals\nSusana Vasquez: guitar \nJemma Heigis: piano\nGiulliana Merello: drums\nPatricia Ligia: bass\nCrystal Torres: trumpet\nHailey-Mae Niswanger: flute\nKatiuska Fernandes: percussion\nIrany Martinez: accordion\nIndia Anderson: tuba\nRob Trujillo: musical director\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre \nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nVideographers:  Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Pilar Galván, Jill Britton\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #eltiny #karolg","title":"Karol G: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1021,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230515","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8UWsFMVj_Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8UWsFMVj_Q/hqdefault.jpg?v=645e62a6","content":{"View count":570458}}

{"description":"“Part of Your World”\nPerformed by Halle Bailey\nFrom Disney’s The Little Mermaid\nSoundtrack available May 19\n\nFilm in theaters May 26: https://www.fandango.com/the-little-mermaid-2023-228960/movie-overview\n\n“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure.

{"description":"The end of the road begins Friday. Watch the FINAL TRAILER Now. #FASTX \n\nGet tickets now: https://tickets.fastxmovie.com/\n\nThe end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga","title":"FAST X | Final Trailer","duration":272,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230515","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoOaKN4qCKw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eoOaKN4qCKw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1968017}}

But recently, a new name has become synonymous with indie film culture and appeal, and it’s not an individual, but a studio.\n\nYou have to admit, their logo is pretty cool.\n\nA24 swept the 2022 Oscars. They’ve made some of the most distinct and interesting movies and TV shows of the past 10 years. But most importantly, they’ve garnered a reputation for quality — and their brand loyalty so strong that hipster film bros everywhere are wearing A24 t-shirts and caps right now.\n\nBut unlike Universal or Paramount, studios that have been around for over a century, A24 has done this in just over a decade. How did this independent film distributor transform into a major player in the entertainment industry in such a short time?\n\nIn this Vox Video, Nate Jones (senior writer at Vulture, and A24 obsessor) breaks down their history, and stratospheric rise to the top.

Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents.

{"description":"Sponsor: Deepcool AK620 Zero Dark on Amazon https://geni.us/apRI9Q\nASUS' actions relating to the Exploding Ryzen CPU debacle are disgraceful and abrasive to the trust that the brand has earned. ASUS has demonstrated clearly it wishes to not only avoid supporting users, but actively engineers ways to abandon them. ASUS' updates haven't even fixed the problems, yet they posture as if they have while simultaneously suggesting that users 'just run defaults' on their $700 motherboards, as if that makes any sense whatsoever. So, to accommodate ASUS' request, we ran defaults and re-benchmarked the Ryzen 7000 series. It sucks. Big surprise. They also don't support their own BIOSes for the ASUS ROG boards.\n\nSupport us!

But their mission is complicated by the beginning of a geopolitical firestorm: The American Revolution has arrived. In the seventh season of OUTLANDER, Jamie, Claire, and their family are caught in the violent birth pains of an emerging nation as armies march to war and British institutions crumble in the face of armed rebellion.\nThe land the Frasers call home is changing – and they must change with it. In order to protect what they’ve built, the Frasers have to navigate the perils of the Revolutionary War. They learn that sometimes to defend what you love, you have to leave it behind. As the conflict draws them out of North Carolina and into the heart of this fight for independence, Jamie, Claire, Brianna, and Roger are faced with impossible decisions that have the potential to tear their family apart.","title":"Outlander | Season 7 Official Trailer | STARZ","duration":162,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxurD9SYbog","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gxurD9SYbog/hqdefault.jpg?v=645d26e3","content":{"View count":7486457}}

{"description":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom reviewed by Tom Marks on Nintendo Switch.\n\nThis is an unfathomable sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas with an alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds.\n\n#IGN #LegendOfZelda","title":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review","duration":876,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdVO_fYoF5g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZdVO_fYoF5g/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1721074}}

{"description":"What if we could actually USE nuclear waste?\nCheck out Storyblocks and sign up here for great footage: https://storyblocks.com/cleoabram \n\nSubscribe to support optimistic tech content: https://www.youtube.com/cleoabram?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch Johnny’s explainer on nuclear power here - and subscribe to his channel! https://youtu.be/QzTgZ6kOEM8\n\nNuclear waste is scary. Maybe you’ve seen it as glowing green goop in The Simpsons, or as a  radioactive threat on the news. Either way, you likely know it has been a major block to the use and improvement of nuclear power. Over the last few decades, experts, politicians and the public have had heated debates over what to do with this radioactive material created by nuclear power plants.\n\nBut what if there were a way to not just store nuclear waste, but actually USE it? \n\nThis video is about the effort to make electricity out of nuclear waste. Really. It turns out, we developed the tools to do this decades ago. This story is about a technology we left behind and the people who want to bring it back.\n\nFor this video, I had the privilege of visiting one of the largest and oldest research centers in the US, the Argonne National Laboratory. I’m incredibly grateful to the researchers and staff I met there, and for their time in showing me their work. I also had the opportunity to speak with representatives from Oklo, a company working on new forms of nuclear power, including recycling nuclear waste as fuel. One of the best parts of making Huge If True is meeting and learning from people pushing what we can do in the hopes of improving the world for everyone else.\n\nChapters: \n00:00 Nuclear waste isn’t what I thought\n02:21 How I got obsessed\n03:27 How much energy is in nuclear waste?\n05:31 Thank you Storyblocks!\n06:20 How do you get electricity?\n06:50 What is uranium?\n07:28 How does a nuclear reaction work?\n08:05 Why is nuclear waste dangerous?\n08:40 What do we do with nuclear waste?\n09:35 How do you make electricity from nuclear waste?\n11:21 Why doesn’t the US reuse nuclear fuel?\n12:20 Is recycling waste feasible?\n13:41 What is Huge If True?\n\nCorrections:\n07:09 The number refers to the total number of nucleons (either a proton or a neutron) in the atom, not the neutrons alone. A U-235 atom contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons (an atomic mass of 235). The U-238 atom also has 92 protons but has 146 neutrons (an atomic mass of 238). I should have said these *differ* by the number of neutrons in the atom.

{"description":"Oppenheimer - Only In Theaters 7 21 23\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. \n \nThe film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. Oscar® winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award® nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar® winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar® nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\nOppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography. \n\nNolan’s films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations. \n\nSocial Handles:\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/oppenheimermovie    \nTW: https://www.twitter.com/@oppenheimerfilm  \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OppenheimerMovie \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/OppenheimerMovie/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/oppenheimermovie\nWebsite: https://www.OppenheimerMovie.com   \n#Oppenheimer","title":"Oppenheimer | New Trailer","duration":187,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230508","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYPbbksJxIg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uYPbbksJxIg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":22231394}}

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to our next installment of our nordic/Scandinavian travel trip! After taking a warm bath in the Blue Lagoon in Iceland - I thought - let’s chill out a bit - literally - and head to the original Ice Hotel in Northern Sweden! Yes, this hotel is made completely out of ice and snow, and it melts and gets rebuilt every year - and yes, people actually sleep in here!! I'm very interested by **strange hotels** and after our trip to the Underwater Hotel last year, when I heard of the ICEHOTEL - I figured, we better check it out. So, after a brief moment being stuck in Iceland, we headed to the ICEHOTEL to investigate & spend the night - and hopefully not get cryogenically frozen like Walt Disney's head. What do you guys think?? Would you stay here? Where should we go next?\n\nAlso - to add on to our disclaimer in the video - \"Lapland\" is not a technically a shared region, it's a general region that spans across a few different countries! \nhttps://scandification.com/where-is-lapland/\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nMelissa Douglas\nBree von Bradsky\nAndrew Lainhart\nPhil Kinney\nElizabeth Pinotti\nIshara Mathews\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS: \n0:00 Intro\n1:56 Stuck In Iceland\n5:20 A Day in Stockholm\n6:55 Traveling to the Ice Hotel\n7:52 Other (Not Icy) Buildings at the Ice Hotel\n9:33 Finally, The Ice Hotel Itself\n10:39 Ice Hotel Room Tours\n14:02 Why does this thing exist?\n16:48 Ice Hotel 365\n18:46 Other Stuff to do at the Ice Hotel\n20:03 Eating the Ice Menu\n21:11 Our (ice) room\n22:49 How to sleep in an ice room\n24:37 Goodnight\n26:13 Good Morning\n27:47 Carve that Ice!\n28:41 Outro\n\n#travel #vlog #hotel","title":"I Spent 24 Hours In A Swedish Ice Hotel","duration":1793,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230507","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfQOsKmyCNY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/KfQOsKmyCNY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1898615}}
