{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John‚Äôs vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles‚Äô endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Peter Jackson\nVideo Producers: Peter Jackson, Clare Olssen, Jonathan Clyde\nAudio Producers: Paul McCartney and Giles Martin\nProduction Company: WingNut Films Productions Ltd\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists Subscribe to The Beatles‚Äô YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup Sign up for The Beatles‚Äô Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   Stream The Beatles: üéôÔ∏è Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic üéôÔ∏è Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify üéôÔ∏è Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic üéôÔ∏è Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora üéôÔ∏è Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal üéôÔ∏è Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer üéôÔ∏è YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   Follow The Beatles:  ‚≠ê https://www.thebeatles.com ‚≠ê https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"The Beatles - Now And Then (Official Music Video)","duration":275,"channel_id":"UC4dqLAF7yT-_DqeYisQ001w","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231103","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opxhh9Oh3rg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Opxhh9Oh3rg/hqdefault.jpg?v=6544f101","content":{"View count":10786457}}

{"description":"The Stuntman becomes the hero. #TheFallGuyMovie only in theaters March 1.\n\n------\n\nHe‚Äôs a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right? \n\nFrom real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy. \n\nOscar¬Æ nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie‚Äîbeing directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)‚Äîgoes missing.\n\nWhile the film‚Äôs ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film‚Äôs most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody‚Äôs good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.\n\nInspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award¬Æ nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). \n\nFrom a screenplay by Hobbs & Shaw screenwriter Drew Pearce, The Fall Guy is produced by Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, Nobody, Atomic Blonde) and David Leitch for their company 87North, and by Ryan Gosling and by Guymon Casady (Game of Thrones, Steve Jobs and executive producer of the upcoming series Ripley) for Entertainment 360. The film is executive produced by Drew Pearce, Entertainment 360‚Äôs Geoff Shaevitz and the creator of the original Fall Guy television series, Glen A. Larson.\n\nWebsite: http://www.TheFallGuyMovie.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thefallguymovie \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thefallguymovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Universalpics \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures\nX: https://twitter.com/thefallguymovie","title":"The Fall Guy | Official Trailer","duration":201,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7jPnwVGdZ8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/j7jPnwVGdZ8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":9528409}}

{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John‚Äôs vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles‚Äô endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Oliver Murray \nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton \nOriginal score: Paul Englishby \nSound Designer: Alastair Sirkett \nAudio Restoration: Park Road Post Production\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists \nSubscribe to The Beatles‚Äô YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup \nSign up for The Beatles‚Äô Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   \n\nStream The Beatles: \nüéôÔ∏è Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic \nüéôÔ∏è Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify \nüéôÔ∏è Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic \nüéôÔ∏è Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora \nüéôÔ∏è Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal \nüéôÔ∏è Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer \nüéôÔ∏è YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   \n\nFollow The Beatles:  \n‚≠ê https://www.thebeatles.com \n‚≠ê https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"The Beatles - Now And Then - The Last Beatles Song (Short Film)","duration":745,"channel_id":"UC4dqLAF7yT-_DqeYisQ001w","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231101","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APJAQoSCwuA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/APJAQoSCwuA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5315699}}

The previous blower design is tear drop shaped so that the direction that the fan spins is un important. Also with the previous design the impeller spins one way and then the other as it is powered by a simple string mechanism.\n\n In the new design, a weight was employed in the form of a heavy log attached to the rotor. The top of the rotor is held and the weight spun to create rotation. This method produces less rpm than the original but allows the fan to be spun continuously in one direction only. To compensate for the lower rpm, the fan was doubled in size (from 25 cm to 50 cm) to increase blade tip speed and so air speed.\n\nNow with a fan that spins in one direction only, a housing could be used to take advantage of this fact. A volute is an expanding spiral and housing for fans that are volute shaped help guide the air from the center to the outlet more efficiently than a tear drop shaped one. This was made using mud on the ground as opposed to a clay portable one as it was starting to get too big to transport.\n\nThe fan was tested in an iron smelt. Disappointingly, it only produced a bit of iron in the form of much smaller prills than usual due to the low rpm and hence air pressure than the original blower. After some rough calculations from research, this design might become competitive with the original blower if the fan diameter was scaled up to 1m diameter from the original 25 cm diameter fan. \n\nThe advantage of this design is that it is simpler and has fewer components than the original as there is no string that needs replacing. The dis advantage is that for it to produce good pressure it's diameter needs to be scaled up to the point where it is no longer compact and portable.\n\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #volute #fireblower","title":"Primitive Technology: Volute Shaped Blower","duration":1185,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20231102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csb-AFD58ww","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Csb-AFD58ww/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1083375}}

But does a jump-scary video game translate well to a two-hour-long feature film with minimal jumpscares and a whole lot of sleeping?\n\nFive Nights At Freddy‚Äôs definitely raises some questions.

{"description":"With new information coming to light about the situation at Bungie, I am much more worried than I was with my first video.  It is very clear that more drastic measures must be taken to bring this game back to life.  But what those measures are is anyone's guess.  Had a LONG discussion about everything that's been going on recently with the layoffs and the news about The Final Shape.  I tried to compile all my thoughts from said discussion into a video.  Might've missed a thing or two, but I think I got most of it.  I don't thrive in these kinds of environments and I really hate making these kinds of videos.

{"description":"Francis Ngannou talks about what the past two days have been like, whether the fight was the best night of his life, what he would have done differently in training camp, his feelings about the judges' decision, whether Fury underestimated him, how he held back during the fight, the pre-fight moment that made him angry, all the doubters he encountered in the media beforehand, whether he'll do boxing or MMA next, the possibility of fighting Deontay Wilder in MMA, why a rematch with Fury isn't an immediate priority, whether he ever doubted the path he took in leaving the UFC and seeking a boxing fight, Dana White's reaction to the fight, the hate he got from fighters before booking the Fury bout, when he'll return to fighting, and more.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4f1JueVgo5t9HSmobCRPug/join\n\nSubscribe to MMA Fighting on YouTube: http://goo.gl/dYpsgH\n\nSubscribe to The MMA Hour on iTunes: http://Apple.co/themmahour\nSubscribe to The MMA Hour on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0NUQhyUeYQcbtHOV10qmbb\nSubscribe to MMA Fighting feed on iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mma-fighting/id320642139\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/u8VvLi\nVisit our playlists: http://goo.gl/eFhsvM\nLike MMAF on Facebook: http://goo.gl/uhdg7Z\nFollow on Twitter: http://goo.gl/nOATUI\nRead More: http://www.mmafighting.com\n\nMMA Fighting is your home for exclusive interviews, live shows, and more for one of the world's fastest-growing sports.
