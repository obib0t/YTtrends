The Mandalorian was the first big streaming hit for Disney Plus and is now paving the way for a TON of other Star Wars projects, as well as serving as a launching pad for some of them. \n\nThe Mandalorian definitely raises a few questions though. Like how many side quests is Mando trying to complete? Is anything a serious threat when his armor makes him practically invincible? Why did Moff Gideon kill his own men and give up his advantage? Why do the bad guys have a sensitive info terminal that lets you use it if you just have a face? Is everything about the Skywalkers, in the end?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to The Mandalorian!

There are little things you think you should do and big things you ought to achieve.\nFrom working out regularly, eating healthy, learning a language, working on your novel, reading more or simply actually doing your hobby instead of browsing reddit.\nBut it can seem that to achieve your goals, you have to become a different person. Someone who is consistent, puts in more effort, has discipline and willpower. Maybe you have tried your hardest to be like that. And it worked! For a while. Until you find yourself slipping back into your old ways. In the end, you always seem to fail. And with every failed attempt, you become more and more frustrated and annoyed with yourself. \nIf you believe “success and hustle” internet, it is all your own fault: if you don't succeed, you just didn’t want it enough and the failure is all you.

These debilitating symptoms blur the line between what is real and what isn't, making it difficult for the person to lead a typical life.\n\nWe believe that Dedrick's schizophrenia is what led him to accidentally drive his car into Winston Lake 16-years earlier. \n\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to Dedrick's family during this difficult time.\n\nHug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them.\n\n❤️..

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #travel #travelvlog #firstclass #jetblue \n\n0:00 2 reasons we’re excited about today!✈️\n1:25 why we’re flying first class\n2:30 how we have airport lounge access🪪\n3:35 boarding our first class flight!🥂\n4:52 first class plane layout\n5:24 AG1 is the BEST\n6:50 first class seat review!\n9:48 meal service🍴\n14:50 Boston to Nassau, Bahamas\n16:00 Our “history” with Riley and Elayna…\n17:13 Nassau to Marsh Harbor, Bahamas\n18:08 moving onto La Vagabond!\n19:07 our awkward first impression⛵️😂","title":"FLYING FIRST CLASS ACROSS AMERICA (6 Hours in JetBlue Mint)","duration":1264,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220606","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxYHX3hXU_4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/pxYHX3hXU_4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":914521}}

{"description":"Season 4 of Stranger Things has really upped the ante, and proved itself as one of the show's best seasons. Creating a show as big as Stranger Things is no easy task. There was a lot of work going on behind the scenes to bring the show to life. Between recreating Southern California in another state, to coordinating massive scenes with crazy stunts, everyone gave a hundred and ten percent to help create this season. That being said, there was also a lot of goofing off and shenanigans between the cast members. Millie Bobby Brown and Noah Schnaap in particular had a lot of hilarious stories about their on set experiences while filming. Can you guess which one of them got pelted by water balloons?\n\nCreating the right look and aesthetic was extremely important for the Stranger Things team. Vecna is one of the coolest monsters we have seen on the show, and a ton of hard work went into creating his look. The prosthetics team had their hands full, as they applied a whopping amount of prosthetics. It’s almost hard to believe how many individual pieces were applied to actor Jamie Campbell. It’s no wonder he spent so long in the makeup chair!\n\nSometimes the best behind the scenes moments have nothing to do with the show, and come purely from the chemistry all the actors have with each other. Like which cast members competed in a fruit by the foot challenge?\n\nWhich behind the scenes moment from Stranger Things season 4 is your favorite?

{"description":"Watch the Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 3 Gameplay Trailer. For more details visit: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-3-season-3\n\nIn Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 3: Vibin’, the Island is one giant party. Bounce around in Reality Falls, brave the Screwballer coaster, ride atop creatures, and revel with new arsenal. Drop into Season 3 and spread the good vibes!\n\nThe Reality Tree has blossomed on the Island, forming a new biome in the process! This location called Reality Falls is a lush forest of mushrooms, bouncy mushrooms, and trees of purple. When you’re not browsing its flora, swim beneath its waterfalls, seek loot in its cavern, and spring from its geysers. \n\nBallers are back! Roll around and grapple onto surfaces, but don’t just roll as you did before. In the spirit of celebration, get on the (totally safe) Screwballer for a high-flying amusement park ride. \n\nDon’t let the high-speed fun stop with Ballers: jump on a wolf or boar to ride on it! You don’t have to dismount to fight — shoot and throw weapons while atop your steed.\n\nReality Seed Pods are spreading from the Reality Tree. Plant a Reality Seed to grow a Reality Sapling — which grows in the same place match to match! Saplings bear better loot each time you weed them, so keep weeding a sapling until it bears Mythic loot. When it wilts away, plant the seed left behind!\n\nBring good and evil together with this Season’s Battle Pass.

Years before he would become the tyrannical President of Panem, 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) is the last hope for his fading lineage, a once-proud family that has fallen from grace in a post-war Capitol. With the 10th annual Hunger Games fast approaching, the young Snow is alarmed when he is assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), the girl tribute from impoverished District 12. But, after Lucy Gray commands all of Panem’s attention by defiantly singing during the reaping ceremony, Snow thinks he might be able to turn the odds in their favor. Uniting their instincts for showmanship and newfound political savvy, Snow and Lucy Gray’s race against time to survive will ultimately reveal who is a songbird, and who is a snake.","title":"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023 Movie) - Reveal","duration":88,"channel_id":"UCJ6nMHaJPZvsJ-HmUmj1SeA","author":"Lionsgate Movies","date":"20220605","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfGcH2T53XY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GfGcH2T53XY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":374440}}
