When I left school, I fell into a wonderful job at a local small engine shop where I worked the counter for a couple years. In 2010 my husband and I opened up our own small engine shop in central Arkansas where I am able to work alongside my family and best friends. We see over 2,000 pieces of small engine equipment every year, and answer 1,000's of small engine questions. We specialize in brands such as Briggs and Stratton, Kohler, Echo and Shindaiwa, but work everyday on MANY other brands like Stihl, Husqvarna, Honda, Craftsman, Remington, Red Max, Troy Bilt, Scag, Bad Boy, Hustler, World Lawn, Poulan, Mantis, Etc..

And I've learned even more about the game since the last one.  But more then that, the game has improved a ton, too!   In this Cities Skylines 2 gameplay video, we'll continue to build Moundsville, which  is a city inspired by a real master plan; however, in this episode, Moundsville completely outgrows its plans as we add a ton of density.\n\nBut beyond just adding density, we'll also build some of the grittier parts of the city, including cargo rail and passenger rail infrastructure, a garbage incineration plant, a new solar power plant and battery backup, all of the specialized industries, and MASSIVE suburban expansions.  By the end, we'll add a ton of skyscrapers to the city.  \n\nStick around until after the tour when I'll give you my completely unvarnished views on the game.\n\nFYI - this is not a sponsored video, but I want to give a huge shout out to  @paradoxinteractive  and the  @CitiesSkylines  team for providing me early access to the game!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS VIDEOS IN SERIES\n\n‚ñ∫  First CS2 video: https://youtu.be/xm2yD9mXgPQ\n‚ñ∫ Seconds CS2 video: https://youtu.be/g9yESIzeyQ0\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFIND ME HERE\n\n‚ñ∫ Website: http://CityPlannerPlays.com \n‚ñ∫ Discord:  https://discord.gg/CityPlannerPlays\n‚ñ∫ Twitter:  https://twitter.com/cityplanneryt\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE CHANNEL, GET COOL PERKS!\n\n‚ñ∫ Merch Store:  https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Store\n‚ñ∫ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CityPlannerPlays\n‚ñ∫ YT Membership: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/YTMembership\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMY MUSIC\n\n‚ñ∫ Master Planned Music: Http://MasterPlannedMusic.com\n‚ñ∫ Epidemic Sound: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Epidemic\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMY GEAR\n\n‚ñ∫ Kit.co Link  https://kit.co/cityplannerplays\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLAYLISTS\n\n‚ñ∫ Ultimate Beginners Guide: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/BeginnersGuide\n‚ñ∫ Cities Skylines II: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/CS2\n‚ñ∫ Tutorials: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Tutorials\n‚ñ∫ Nicolet Bay: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/NicoletBay\n‚ñ∫ Verde Beach: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/VerdeBeach\n‚ñ∫ Clearwater County: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/ClearwaterCounty\n‚ñ∫ Abandoned City Fix: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/AbandonedCity\n‚ñ∫ Sustainable City: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/SustainableCity\n‚ñ∫ Bluffside Crossing: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Bluffside\n‚ñ∫ City Tips: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/CityTips\n‚ñ∫ Previous Live Streams: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Streams\n‚ñ∫ Timberborn: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Timberborn\n‚ñ∫ Other Games: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/OtherGames\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHASHTAGS\n\n#CitiesSkylines2 #cityplannerplays\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHAPTERS\n\nSeries Recap and Off Camera Fixes! - 0:00\nI'm the Trash Man! - 2:37\nALL of the Rail - 6:04\nThe Suburbs - 17:46\nSolar - 32:01\nSpecialized Industry - 37:04\nIncreasing Density - 46:34\nCity Tour - 53:52\nHow I feel about the game after 143 hours - 55:30","title":"After 143 hours playing Cities Skylines 2, I built THIS city and have a few thoughts...","duration":3598,"channel_id":"UC8WAaaW2FnctRI9coYJoUdA","author":"City Planner Plays","date":"20231011","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P21vSG4Adwc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P21vSG4Adwc/hqdefault.jpg?v=65265560","content":{"View count":485623}}

{"description":"Back to where it all started! Five years ago, I rented a Royal Enfield Himalayan in Manali, India and rode it around the Himalayan mountains for a couple of weeks. I loved it so much, that I bought one in Delhi, named it Basanti and rode it half across the world. Now, I am back in the Himalayas, but this time, on the NEW Himalayan, a bike that is not yet launched. I got the incredible opportunity to try this pre-production bike out, and this time, I have my cameras to record these adventures in India. LET'S GO!! \n\nWant to learn how to use drones, GoPros and 360 cameras to film your solo motorcycle adventure?

{"description":"The 2024 Lamborghini Revuelto is the company‚Äôs first high-performance hybrid supercar. Powered by a roaring V12 with an absurdly high 9500 rpm redline and three electric motors, the Revuelto makes over 1000 horsepower combined. All of this explosive and electric power is connected by a transversal dual clutch e-gearbox, which aids in achieving Lamborghini‚Äôs claimed 0-100 kmh time of just 2.5 seconds. But performance aside, does a hybrid Lamborghini still feel like a Lamborghini? And how is it on the track? Thomas is off to Italy to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling!

I was going to package this video as a \"Revisiting SkyGrid\" video, but I figured packaging it as a \"100 Days\" Minecraft video would be more appealing to a wider audience and would add a bit of CHALLENGE to the video! I did survive 133 days in the game but a lot of it was AFKing because I would either sit around on my phone or be eating food LOL! So during post production it was hard for my editor to keep track of how many days passed throughout the gameplay, but I assure you, it was well over 100 days :) Thanks for understanding, love you guys! :D\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSkyGrid Map: https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/skygrid-minecraft-1-20/\n\n#minecraft #hardcore #but","title":"Revisiting SKYGRID in Minecraft - 11 Years Later","duration":1800,"channel_id":"UCIVSqoHCUN1XdEpiVItxfoQ","author":"aCookieGod","date":"20231008","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoteJMb2aE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sAoteJMb2aE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1211179}}
{"description":"Gabriel Martinelli‚Äôs late deflected strike gave us a huge win against Champions Manchester City at Emirates Stadium.\n\nIn a game with little goalmouth action throughout, it was left to substitute Martinelli ‚Äì on his first appearance since the middle of September ‚Äì to score the only goal of the game, and move us above Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men in the table.\n\nIt ended a run of 12 consecutive defeats against City, and it‚Äôs a victory that could yet prove significant come the end of the season.\n\nAs usual, the atmosphere inside Emirates Stadium was electric at kick off. Both sides knew top spot in the Premier League was up for grabs.\n\nIt was the visitors who had the first sight of goal. From their first corner of the afternoon, Josko Gvardiol hooked goalwards, but Declan Rice was well placed to head off the line. The danger was not cleared though, until Nathan Ake blazed over when the ball fell to him inside the area.\n\nIt was a big let off early on, and there was another on the quarter hour. We were playing the ball around at the back, but David Raya spent just too long in possession, Julian Alvarez closed him down and the keeper‚Äôs attempted clearance clattered against the Argentine and just wide of his own post.\n\nWe needed to get into the game, and Eddie Nketiah did well to work a shooting opportunity inside the area, but flashed his effort wide.\n\nWe began to come back into the game, the intensity increased and there was a flashpoint when Mateo Kovacic dived in late on Martin Odegaard. He was only shown a yellow card, despite a VAR review.\n\nWithin minutes the Croatian then fouled Declan Rice with a similar lunge, but to the amazement of the Emirates faithful, the referee kept his cards in his pocket.\n\nWe were having our best spell of the half, and Alex Zinchenko had two speculative shots from the edge of the area blocked.\n\nMikel Arteta introduced Gabriel Martinelli for the second half, the Brazilian returning to action after missing the last five games with injury.\n\nHe took up his usual position on the left, replacing Leandro Trossard, with Gabriel Jesus on the opposite flank. After a run of 87 consecutive appearances in the Premier League, Bukayo Saka was not involved at all.\n\nMartinelli struck our first shot on target five minutes after coming on. He was set up by Declan Rice, but the angle was always against him.\n\nThe pace of the game began to drop, and chances were scarce for either side. As we entered the final 15 minutes, Arteta made a triple change, bringing on Kai Havertz, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Thomas Partey.\n\nThree of the four subs combined for the goal.\n\nTomiyasu laid off a long pass to Havertz just inside the area, who in turn passed back to Martinelli. His shot was on target, but completely wrong-footed Ederson when it smashed off Nathan Ake‚Äôs face.\n\nThe Emirates erupted. We had barely been troubled at the back, but now we had a lead to see out.\n\nWe managed it without much cause for alarm, to extend our unbeaten start in the Premier League, and finally get one over last season‚Äôs treble-winners.\n\n#arsenal \n\n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.
