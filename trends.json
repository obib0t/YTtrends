{"description":"Lake Mead, which is located in Black Canyon approximately 30 miles east of Las Vegas U.S. is facing an unprecedented drought. As the drought rages on, the river and its reservoirs are facing a crisis. But, the water supply is drying up, which is having a profound effect on the region's economies.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing happening, as falling water levels reveal things previously hidden or lost, some with great implications for our well-being. What is happening to Lake Mead, and why is it drying up? And what sinister things and shocking discoveries lie beneath the water? Let's find out.\n\nLake Mead's profile and history.\nOn the Colorado river in the South-West of the U.S. lies the sprawling Lake Mead which straddles the states of Arizona and Nevada and is 24 miles east of Sin City, Las Vegas. An artificial reservoir formed by the iconic Hoover Dam, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States by volume when at its total capacity of 1.1 trillion cubic feet of water and is the second largest by surface area in the U.S. at 247 square miles, eclipsed only by Lake Powell, another reservoir upstream of Lake Mead on the Colorado river with a surface area of 254 square miles. \n\nWith such a large capacity, the Lake can hold the total annual flow of the Colorado river for two years. Lake Mead stretches 65 miles at full pool from the Hoover dam to Pearce Ferry; however, the Lake is relatively thin, with a maximum width of 9.3 miles. At full pool, Lake Mead has an elevation of about 1229 feet above sea level and a maximum depth of 532 ft. While not a particularly wide lake, it boasts a shoreline of 759 miles.\n\nterrifying discovery, nature discoveries, euphrates river, new discoveries 2022, euphrates river drying up, euphrates river drying up 2022, end of times, mississippi river drying up 2022, biblical, rapture, rapture dreams, rapture 2022, eden garden, garden of eden, mississippi river, biblical archaeology, revelations, end of times, the prophecy, bible prophecy, lake mead, lake mead water level 2022, lake mead update, drying up, drought, climate change, supply chain, hoover dam, lake powell,","title":"What JUST HAPPENED With Lake Mead SHOCKED Scientists!","duration":777,"channel_id":"UCpIhGdHkOJ2sHkqM3YNIKsA","author":"Nature Discoveries","date":"20230108","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl97t2PcC8w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cl97t2PcC8w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":609754}}

{"description":"Episode 127 of Mike Finnegan's Garage is all about crossing another one off of my bucket list and don't worry, the Cadillac is not taking a back seat to this one. In fact, a week from now I should have the engine for the Caddy, which means more work, more progress, and more videos. In the meantime, I managed to drag this 1963 Chevrolet Split Window Corvette out of my neighbor's basement, where it's been sitting for years. \nAfter the Caddy is running, then it's full steam ahead on turning the Vette into a 6 second street car, using the 711ci Sonny Leonard Hemi as the powerplant. Hope you enjoy this video as much as I had buying and pulling this car home. \n\nWant to support the channel?

I'm stuck in my house recovering from spine surgery and I've missed hanging out with you Spy Ninjas so I figured a Minecraft challenge is the best way to have fun with you all. \n\nToday is my first day of learning how to play Minecraft and the goal is survival of my first night. I need to learn how to build a Minecraft house. Maybe I need to watch a YouTube minecraft house tutorial. Then I'll need to figure out how to put a bed in the house and sleep my first night. Hopefully, I can survive without running into any creepers, hackers, or zombies. \n\nIf I become a true Minecraft Pro, maybe I can play with one of my favorite Minecraft YouTubers. Here are some of fun Minecraft gameplay:\n\nPrestonPlayz - Minecraft Myths You Shouldn't Watch at Night...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2KhmZ3A0Ho\n\nCash - Cash Has A GOLD TOUCH In Minecraft!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL9nTBnZ3Ho\n\nAphmau - Playing Minecraft as an UNHELPFUL Hamster!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL-QzqGmIVE\n\nNico - Nico vs Cash MILLIONAIRE House Battle in Minecraft!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i99NV1sVzIY\n\nGEVidsTV - NOOB vs HACKER: I Cheated In a BOXY BOO Build Challenge!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP7-4gh_cWo\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.

{"description":"A Day in the Life of a Japanese Game Designer also know in Japan as a Game Planner for a Japanese Development Company.  This is life working in Tokyo in the Japan Game Industry developing games for mobile devices.  It includes the average work day and typical working hours of a Japanese office.  If  you want to learn what it is like working in the Japan game industry then this video should help provide insight on the type of work life and work culture in Japan.  Shuta works as a Lead Game Designer aka Game Planner at Colopl. One of the largest mobile game developers in Japan popular for making casual mobile games like Shironkeo Project, Meow Meow and Star Acres. With about 800 employees in their Tokyo office, their creative teams produce a wide variety of mobile games.  As a Japanese game planner, it‚Äôs important to have strong management and communication skills.  It‚Äôs not enough to be creative and come up with ideas, but a planner must also be able to organize these ideas, create proposals and specification documents in order to effectively communicate their ideas to their teams.  Apparently, it took a total of 7 years of development to complete the game Neko Golf. In fact, the development itself froze after 4 years, but then was later restarted and the team restructured when Shuta joined the team 3 years ago.  For many playing the game, they‚Äôll probably never truly understand how much time went into creating it, but for the team I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a great sense of completing the game. \n\n\"NEKO GOLF -Anime GOLF-\"\nDownload the app here!\n ‚ñΩEnglish\nhttps://colopl.page.link/jpRZ\n‚ñΩÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥(Korean)\nhttps://colopl.page.link/BWEk\n‚ñΩÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá(Chinese)\nhttps://colopl.page.link/gR7A\n\n„Ç∑„É•„Éü„É¨„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„Ç¥„É´„ÉïÊíÆÂΩ±ÂçîÂäõ\nBAGUS ÂÖ≠Êú¨Êú®Â∫ó\n\nWatch more of my Japan Day in the Life videos:\n- https://tokyozebra.com/ditl\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?

Like why is this called Clash of the Titans when there are zero titans in it? What‚Äôs the Kraken doing here in a Greek Mythology story?

MIT engineers had already proved that pine branches can be used as water filters as the thin membranes connecting the straw like xylem filter out 99% of bacteria such as E.coli which make water unsafe to drink ( https://meche.mit.edu/news-media/mit-engineers-make-filters-tree-branches-purify-drinking-water ). Taking this concept, I used a type of cane in the forest and bent them into hook shapes, tying them in place with vine. Then I put dirty water into a raised pot and siphoned clean water from it into a lower collection pot. Initially some sap comes (which is also harmless to drink) out but then water flows through the stem. It does take a while for it to work but the process can be sped up by adding multiple canes working in parallel. The water that came through is clean and I was able to drink it without ill effect. After a few days the canes clog up and need replacing though one cane lasted longer than the others for some reason. Also in this video, I test the effectiveness of filtering water through a clay pot submerged in a creek, the ceramic walls acting as a filter for the creek water. Both methods seem to work but the clay pot method is more useable and needs less maintenance. But, the cane siphon would be better if no clay pots were available, simply filtering water from a puddle into a lower collection container such as a folded leaf.\n\n00:00- Making filter/siphon\n02:12- Using filter/siphon\n03:53- Alternative pot filter\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #waterfilter  #survival","title":"Primitive Technology: Cane Water Filter/Siphon","duration":307,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230105","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG-rNHgFxhs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nG-rNHgFxhs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1185251}}

Each second the breath is channeled directly at an enemy will deal bonus damage, which is improved by the amount of Stardust that's been collected. This ability collects Stardust if the target is a champion.\n\n00:21 ASTRAL FLIGHT\nAurelion Sol flies over terrain in a targeted direction. While in this state, he can cast other abilities.

This ability grants Stardust each time an enemy dies within the black hole and for each second an enemy champion is caught inside it.\nThe center of the black hole executes enemies who are below a certain percentage of their maximum health. Stardust increases Singularity's size as well as the execution threshold.\n\n00:36 FALLING STAR - R\nFalling Star: Aurelion Sol crashes a star into the earth.
