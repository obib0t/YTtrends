Get ready to start a new fair Dinkum life and build a home on an Island inspired by the wild Australian outback. Explore tropical eucalyptus forests, survive scorching deserts, relax at cool billabongs and discover scrubland filled with adorable Aussie inspired wildlife. Collect valuable resources by hunting, mining, fishing and foraging to expand and customise your town and attract new townsfolk and businesses. Share your new home with friends and protect each other as you explore beautiful landscapes filled with dangerous predators.\n\nGo from starting out sleeping in a swag under the stars, to a sprawling town with farms, businesses and attractions. Eventually, you‚Äôll draw in visitors, who might decide to stay and make it their home too.\n\nKeep your neighbours happy by customising your town with fences, flower beds, street lamps, beehives, windmills, hedges, fountains and more. The happier your townsfolk are the more likely they are to settle down, bring their families and set up stores with unique items.\n\nInvite your friends to visit your town where they can help you construct buildings, shop at your stores, go fishing, race Emus, fight crocodiles much more!\n\nThe island is Choc-A-Bloc with insects, fish and minerals. So grab your thongs and go track down and collect them all for your personal museum collection, or sell them for a tidy profit!\n\nCare for and breed chickens, cows and sheep as well as Dinkum‚Äôs iconic Giant Wombats! The Wombats might seem intimidating at first, but really they are sweethearts.\n\nCultivate crops for your town across the whole island, choosing the best spots for each type. Not only do the seasons change, but the temperature shifts depending on where you are on the island\n\nHunt animals for food and defend yourself from deadly predators who are just as hungry as you. Those Roos might seem friendly but they pack a punch!\n\nAttack creatures head on or capture them with traps, it‚Äôs up to you how to survive.\n\nCustomise your character in Dinkum to be the True Blue version of you. Buy that shiny pair of sunnies or wide Akubra hat in the shop, or seek out rare items through exploring the great outdoors and through chinwags with fellow townsfolk.\n\nMake your house your own cosy abode. Craft a huge range of furniture and decorations, choose where everything goes and invite friends over to show off your interior designer creds.","title":"I Found Paradise and Ruined It for Everyone","duration":1163,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220828","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDmsYbJCwng","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hDmsYbJCwng/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2164952}}

{"description":"Get an entire year of both CuriosityStream and Nebula for just $14.79 here: http://CuriosityStream.com/mustard\n\nSupport Mustard on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/MustardChannel\nMustard Store: https://www.teespring.com/stores/mustard-store\nWebsite: https://www.mustardchannel.com/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/MustardVideos\n\nThanks to Azzecco for producing the incredible XB-35 and YB-49 modes used in this video, visit: https://www.artstation.com/acez3d\n\nAt the start of the 1940‚Äôs, flying wing aircraft seemed destined to be the next evolution in aircraft design. By eliminating structural components typically found on conventional aircraft, such as engine nacelles, fuselage and tail, parasitic drag would be reduced down to its absolute minimum. The result would be a high-lift, low-drag aircraft with unequaled speed, range and efficiency. \n\nDespite earlier efforts around the world to develop all-wing aircraft designs, arguably no single person was more committed to the concept than pioneering American aircraft designer Jack Northrop. Beginning in the 1920‚Äôs Northrop studied the concept, drawing up countless designs for flying wing aircraft. By 1940, he had successfully produced two prototypes, the Model 1 (‚ÄúX216H‚Äù) in 1929 and the Northrop N-1M in 1940. But Northrop‚Äôs ambitions went far beyond just experimental planes.\n\nResponding to an urgent need for the United States to develop the first ever intercontinental bomber, in 1941 Northrop presented the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) with a concept for an enormous flying wing bomber that would offer unparalleled speed, range and efficiency. Not only would the aircraft far outperform conventional bombers, the all-wing design would make it structurally more simple and economical to build. Impressed with Northrop‚Äôs concept, the USAAF agreed to fund the aircraft‚Äôs development, ordering an experimental model designated as the XB-35 and pre-production models designated as YB-35s. The USAAF would eventually order over 200 production aircraft which were to be designated as B-35s. Later, a jet powered version, designated as the YB-49 would also be produced.\n\nBut engineering such unconventional aircraft would be a daunting engineering challenge for Northrop and his small team of engineers. Eliminating conventional control surfaces would maximize lift and minimize drag, but it would also create new unforeseen technical issues, many of which would only be discovered during flight testing - with tragic consequences. Despite best efforts by Northrop to solve technical issues with flying wing aircraft, solutions would prove elusive using technology available in the 1940s.\n\n \nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\n\nIntro Song:  ‚ÄúDark Frontier‚Äù- go.apmmusic.com/04x3\n\nSong 1: ‚ÄúNo Tomorrow‚Äù - go.apmmusic.com/ow4z\n\nSong 2: ‚ÄúDark Sun‚Äù - go.apmmusic.com/lqbd\n\nSong 3: ‚ÄúPulsating Tension‚Äù- go.apmmusic.com/c64q\n\nSong 4:  ‚ÄúDocumentaries‚Äù- https://audiojungle.net/item/documentaries/29566240\n\nSong 6:  ‚ÄúIntensity‚Äù - go.apmmusic.com/snrq\n\nOutro Song:  ‚ÄúDark Frontier‚Äù- go.apmmusic.com/04x3\n\nThanks for watching!","title":"What Happened To Flying Wings?","duration":811,"channel_id":"UC1ZBQ-F-yktYD4m5AzM6pww","author":"Mustard","date":"20220827","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dByvPIyIbZE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dByvPIyIbZE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":624856}}

{"description":"Today, we unleash our true inner caveman gamer by taking on master mode Terraria with only spears. There's nothing I love more than being in fear for my life while a mechanical death worm chases me and all I have to defend myself is a sword attached to a stick. Moon Lord was bad enough, I would rather explode twelve times in public than even think of trying to defeat the Empress of Light with a stick dagger. It's not going to happen, even if I tried. I would combust internally. If you enjoyed, be sure to subscribe, like, comment, as well as join the Discord and friggity follow that Instagram for updates!

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n#northpole #icebreaker #cruise #arcticcruise #travel #travelvlog \n\n00:00 Ep. 2 of 5: North Pole Series!\n00:53 Morning coffee #1\n01:40 Nate‚Äôs new bad habit (breakfast)\n02:27 Our new healthy habit ;) (gym)\n05:06 Lunch/Nate's backwards hat lol\n06:34 Best VPN!\n07:34 GORGEOUS sauna!

{"description":"Watch the Official Trailer for #TheRingsOfPower now. Join us in Middle-earth on September 2.\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien‚Äôs pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N√∫menor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power - Official Trailer | Prime Video","duration":160,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220823","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8UAUAuKNcU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8UAUAuKNcU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":12328719}}

{"description":"Funny Marco welcomes William Ray Norwood Jr. known professionally as Ray J, an American singer, actor, and television personality. Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Carson, California, he is the younger brother of recording artist and actress Brandy Norwood and the first cousin of rapper Snoop Dogg.\n\nMarco gets into the interview with Ray J and it starts off very spirited as Ray J says he wakes up mic‚Äôd up and says let‚Äôs start with the product and does a shameless plug about Raycon. Not to be upstaged, Marco sells Ray J on the idea of pitching his product to him. Marco then asks Ray J about the integrity of some of his products which Ray J explains. Marco then sets up Ray J talking about his song ‚ÄúOne Wish‚Äù and the contradiction of it. Ray J replies by saying Marco exposed him for being a hypocrite. Marco then asks Ray J if he is a member of B2K in return Ray J details the story of how B2K tried to recruit him and how he declined after they didn‚Äôt want to change the name to Ray2K and he formed the group RSVP. Marco then challenges Ray J to a staring contest and Ray J is keen to the tricks and claims to be himathy or him and her. The random questions continue as Ray J says his shirt is sweaty and changes his shirt and says he just shaved his chest hair. As he is getting re-mic‚Äôd Ray J yells he only does one podcast a year and unashamedly plugs all his products. As Ray J plugs his products Marco asks about the products and then Ray J offers Marco a podcast for which Marco challenges Ray J for answering his phone and Ray J holds exception. Ray J pairs his phone while in the interview. While conducting the interview Ray J prays openly and Marco tries to center the interview. Ray J continues to expound on his products and the name Ray J. Marco then asks about Justin Bieber and Ray J elaborates on how the conversation went. Marco replies by saying the producer revealed that the Justin Bieber conversation never happened. Ray J vehemently expounds that the story did happen and there is no beef with Justin Bieber. \n\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries  IG @therealdavemays @igobybrettj\n\nDirector: Matt Ables IG @mattablespromotions\n\nDirector of Photography: Rashid ‚ÄúCruz‚Äù Terry/Blaqk Noyze Produktionz\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n\nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco \n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Ray J Talks Justin Bieber Beef,  Raycon Earbuds, B2K, RSVP Group, Shaves Chest Hair","duration":1385,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20220823","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zxhBau3IU8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zxhBau3IU8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":775272}}
