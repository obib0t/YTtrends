{"description":"Welcome to the ULTIMATE petrol vs electric drag race! \n\nWe‚Äôve got our hands on the all-new Tesla Cybertruck, and it‚Äôs lining up alongside the a Lamborghini Urus! But which will come out on top - petrol, or electric? \n\nWell, let‚Äôs check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it‚Äôll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. It also has a top speed of 130mph. \n\nThen we have the Lambo. It‚Äôs packing a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet, and this can produce 650hp and 850Nm of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-speed torque converter gearbox, and it‚Äôs a whole lot lighter than the Tesla, tipping the scales at 2,200kg. It also has a much bigger top speed, coming in at 190mph. \n\nSo the Cybertruck has the Urus beat when it comes to performance stats, but will the extra weight drag it down?

{"description":"From the executive producers of Band of Brothers and The Pacific comes Masters of the Air. The 9-part series event premieres January 26 https://apple.co/_MastersOfTheAir\n\nBased on Donald L. Miller‚Äôs book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff, ‚ÄúMasters of the Air‚Äù follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the ‚ÄúBloody Hundredth‚Äù) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler‚Äôs Third Reich, is at the heart of ‚ÄúMasters of the Air.‚Äù Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.\n\nThe series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle and Nate Mann, who are joined by Raff Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, \"Masters of the Air\" is executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Television, and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman for Playtone. Amblin Television‚Äôs Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey co-executive produce alongside Playtone‚Äôs Steven Shareshian. In addition to writing, Orloff co-executive produces. Graham Yost also serves as co-executive producer. Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees and Tim Van Patten serve as directors.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

{"description":"Since 1927, TIME has chosen a Person of the Year, the editors‚Äô assessment of the individual who most shaped the headlines over the previous 12 months, for better or for worse. \n\nAs a tradition, Person of the Year springs from the Great Man Theory of history, a belief that individuals have the power to transform society. The selections over the years have tended to follow certain patterns. The person chosen has typically been a ruler over traditional domains of power. He‚Äîand yes, usually it has been a ‚Äúhe‚Äù‚Äîis very often a politician or a titan of industry. Fourteen U.S. Presidents, five leaders of Russia or the Soviet Union, and three Popes have all been recognized.\n\nAnd yet the person whose singular influence was revealed throughout 2023 has held none of these roles‚Äîor anything remotely similar. Every year contains light and dark; 2023 was a year with significant shares of darkness. In a divided world, where too many institutions are failing, Taylor Swift found a way to transcend borders and be a source of light. No one else on the planet today can move so many people so well. Achieving this feat is something we often chalk up to the alignments of planets and fates, but giving too much credit to the stars ignores her skill and her power. \n\nTaylor Swift is TIME‚Äôs 2023 Person of the Year.\n\nRead more: https://ti.me/4alhkbl\nSubscribe to TIME Breaking News YouTube Channel ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫: https://ti.me/3ROMUXY\nSubscribe to TIME‚Äôs YouTube channel ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://ti.me/subscribe-time\nSubscribe to TIME: https://ti.me/3E3UCqt\nGet the day‚Äôs top headlines to your inbox, curated by TIME editors: http://ti.me/the-brief\nFollow us:\nTwitter: https://ti.me/3xTVwSk\nFacebook: https://ti.me/3xWI2Fg\nInstagram: https://ti.me/3dO9Rcc","title":"Taylor Swift is TIME‚Äôs 2023 Person of the Year","duration":447,"channel_id":"UC8Su5vZCXWRag13H53zWVwA","author":"TIME","date":"20231206","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDXqb1Pub-Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RDXqb1Pub-Q/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":419644}}

In 2014, Ali impressed comedy enthusiasts by displaying his ability to captivate an audience with his \"Mexicans Got On Boots\" tale, descriptive storytelling, with over 15 million views, of a prison riot on THIS IS NOT HAPPENING, the first of three appearances.  His stories continued with his HALF HOUR special, which premiered on Comedy Central in the fall of 2016.  Immediately following the premiere of that special, Comedy Central offered Ali an hour-special where he performed for inmates live in a Texas jail, sending Ali back to where it all started. The hour special, Ali Siddiq: It‚Äôs Bigger Than These Bars, premiered in February 2018 on Comedy Central.  In 2019, Ali could be seen as a Top 5 finalist on NBC‚Äôs BRING THE FUNNY.

Lots of that time was faffing around with a Word document, not even sure what the point of the script was, but anyhow - today, very excited to be finally uploading and rid of the thing, there I was doing a bit of last minute polishing in the video editor and suddenly I notice I've deleted half the video in the timeline. Just gone. I reload the old save file but it's too late, I've written over it already. About a month of work gone in three seconds of mis-clicking. I'm not sure how far back in the day I made the mistake and did I mention that the file is so large now that the undo function locks the video editor up almost every time? There's only one option left: tentatively keep hitting undo and just pray this doesn't lock the editor up otherwise ALL GONE, and just pray the buffer remembers far back enough to restore the sequence I deleted otherwise ALL GONE. There I sat for thirty minutes hitting ctrl-z as gently as I could, sweat dripping from my furrowed brow, even the mice who live in the walls of my apartment coming out to watch and bite their fingernails or claws or whatever it is mice have, their cheese untouched, their traps empty.... Anyway everything was fine even if I almost soiled myself - the undo function worked and I briefly felt good about living again for the first time in ten years. I am an idiot.

Play as V, a cyberpunk mercenary, and take on the most powerful forces of the city in a fight for glory and survival. Dive into the base game, its critically acclaimed spy-thriller expansion Phantom Liberty, and experience the game-changing Update 2.0 ‚Äî all in one package. Legends are made here. What will yours be?\n\nDescriptive text:\n\nA trailer made up of dynamic cuts between gameplay footage from Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty interspersed with live-action scenes of actors Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba.\n\nGame footage shows the silhouette of Solomon Reed, a dark-skinned man in a brown leather trench coat, shooting a gun at an unseen enemy. Soldiers jump out of an AV into a burning building. An explosion throws President Myers, a white woman in a pantsuit, to the ground. Trauma Team employees defibrillate a woman. A police car explodes.\n\nAn AV flies over a sweeping expanse of Night City. A black title card reads: ‚ÄúAn Unprecedented Revival. The Guardian.‚Äù An enormous pyramid-shaped building glows in Dogtown. In an alleyway, a group of women beat up a man who is lying on the ground. A black title card reads: ‚ÄúAn Unforgettable Open-World Experience. Polygon.‚Äù\n\nInside of a club, Idris Elba wears a black suit jacket and walks forward as he speaks to the camera. In the game, a heavily armed MaxTac unit drops onto the ground from an AV. A MaxTac agent points a gun at V. The trunk of a car is opened to reveal an arsenal of weapons. A red-haired woman winks at V over a roulette table.\n\nKeanu Reeves speaks. In the game, characters dance on a crowded dance floor. Four musicians stand on stage as the audience applauds. A rock band plays on a cramped stage with the Samurai logo behind them. A blue-haired woman looks up at V.\n\nKeanu Reeves walks backwards as he speaks. In Cyberpunk 2077, an intimidating cyborg soldier with red eyes walks past. Dogtown leader Kurt Hansen is trailed by two loyal soldiers. A man covered in implants and with a cybernetic light in his forehead gestures. A woman climbs out of a storage container.\n\nIdris Elba strides forward in the club. In the game, V pierces an enemy‚Äôs chest with two electric blades then knocks another enemy back with a shotgun blast. V drives a sleek Quadra car through Night City streets. A masked enemy swings two glowing red blades at V.\n\nArmed forces exit an AV, guns aimed forward. A powerful pistol blast explodes a motorcycle in mid-air. A silver-skinned woman floats aboveground in a holographic light show. V faces down various enemies and a large battle tank.\n\nThe Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition logo glitches into view.

It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris ‚Äî and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there‚Äôs a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. \n\nWhen we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It‚Äôs a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. \n\nWe got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:\n\nHere is some of Michel J√©brak‚Äôs research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32048440_Resolving_the_Richat_enigma_Doming_and_hydrothermal_karstification_above_an_alkaline_complex\n\nHere is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi‚Äôs original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318723814_Petrogenesis_of_the_Ambohiby_Complex_Madagascar_and_the_role_of_the_Marion_Hotspot_plume\n\nWe also spoke with Stian Rice, author of Famine in the Remaking, who helped us understand more about the history of agriculture in Madagascar:  https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/01/24/madagascars-famine-is-more-than-climate-change/\n\nCheck out Stian‚Äôs book on famine and food systems: https://wvupressonline.com/node/831\n\nNorman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell‚Äôs SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/\n\nCorrection: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilm√© as a professor of geology at the University of Florida. In fact, she is a national coordinator of the Madagascar Program at the World Resources Institute. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
