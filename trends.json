{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day.

{"description":"The Stuntman becomes the hero. #TheFallGuyMovie only in theaters March 1.\n\n------\n\nHe’s a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right? \n\nFrom real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy. \n\nOscar® nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie—being directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)—goes missing.\n\nWhile the film’s ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film’s most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody’s good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.\n\nInspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). \n\nFrom a screenplay by Hobbs & Shaw screenwriter Drew Pearce, The Fall Guy is produced by Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, Nobody, Atomic Blonde) and David Leitch for their company 87North, and by Ryan Gosling and by Guymon Casady (Game of Thrones, Steve Jobs and executive producer of the upcoming series Ripley) for Entertainment 360. The film is executive produced by Drew Pearce, Entertainment 360’s Geoff Shaevitz and the creator of the original Fall Guy television series, Glen A. Larson.\n\nWebsite: http://www.TheFallGuyMovie.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thefallguymovie \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thefallguymovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Universalpics \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures\nX: https://twitter.com/thefallguymovie","title":"The Fall Guy | Official Trailer","duration":201,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7jPnwVGdZ8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/j7jPnwVGdZ8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4531098}}

{"description":"With new information coming to light about the situation at Bungie, I am much more worried than I was with my first video.  It is very clear that more drastic measures must be taken to bring this game back to life.  But what those measures are is anyone's guess.  Had a LONG discussion about everything that's been going on recently with the layoffs and the news about The Final Shape.  I tried to compile all my thoughts from said discussion into a video.  Might've missed a thing or two, but I think I got most of it.  I don't thrive in these kinds of environments and I really hate making these kinds of videos.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.","title":"Chelsea 2-0 Blackburn | EXTENDED Highlights | Carabao Cup 4th Round 2023/24 | Chelsea FC","duration":678,"channel_id":"UCU2PacFf99vhb3hNiYDmxww","author":"Chelsea Football Club","date":"20231102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TrQwYTVyoU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2TrQwYTVyoU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1462218}}

From Snickers to Skittles to every Reese's shape imaginable, I am a halloween candy fiend. \n\nSo I had a horrible idea that I decided to act upon: what if we tried to melt every halloween candy together into a single franken-candy... the one candy to rule them all, and in the darkness, satiate my desire for an entire bucket of halloween candy in just one bite? \n\nWell, I guess we're gonna find out.

{"description":"Tony Hawk is the consigliere of skateboarding and an icon of pop culture. He's got more than a dozen X-Games medals, was named the top vert skater every year from 1984 to 1996, and boasts one of the most commercially and critically successful video-game franchises of all time, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. But how is he with spicy food? Find out as The Birdman makes his triumphant return to Hot Ones and takes on not only the wings of death, but also the brand-new Hot Ones Hot Pockets—now available nationwide.

I travelled to Nashville to complete this and had the pleasure of working with the legend Darius Rucker. I'm still in shock.
