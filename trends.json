Sand contains a minor proportion of iron in the form of magnetite (and some hematite), the rest of the sand being other non iron minerals such as silica.  In this form it is not concentrated enough to use as an ore to produce iron metal. However, it is possible to concentrate the magnetite grains from the silica sand using gravity separation, as magnetite is heavier than silica sand. \n\nSo, I made a sluice box from a spare roof tile I made in an earlier video. The curved tile acts as a chute and grooves were carved into the concave surface perpendicular to it's length. When sand was put into the sluice and water was run over it, the heavier magnetite got trapped in the grooves and most of the lighter sand was washed away. The trapped iron sand was then tipped into a collection pot. This sand was then sluiced a second time to concentrate it further. From experiment, it was found that sluicing twice yields the best result for effort, sluicing a 3rd time does little to further concentrate the ore.\n\n A furnace was then built and the ore tested. About 500g of charcoal and 200g of iron sand were charged every 5 minutes, for 6 charges. The result was a small amount of iron in the form of some cast iron spherical prills (similar to other smelts I've done) and jagged coral like formations, also of cast iron (a form new to me). When comparing the result to my usual ore, iron bacteria, it produces about the same amount of iron but with a different shape. \n\nThe benefit of using iron sand as an ore is that it can be found in almost all geological areas that have a creek or river, though the iron will be more concentrated in some areas than others. I did this experiment in a basalt rich geological location but have heard that sand formed from granite produces even better results. In summary, Iron sand, though laborious to process is easily found in most creeks, rivers and beaches and so this technique of benefiction is worth learning. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #iron  #sand","title":"Primitive Technology: Making Iron From Sand","duration":609,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20220901","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPIUMpiV0IY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OPIUMpiV0IY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1116104}}

In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  \n\nI spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams and some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops. Moreover, you‚Äôll learn about Kratos‚Äô tools/toys, a never-before-seen dwarven realm that feels lived in, the unprecedented number of accessibility features available at launch, and some quality-of-life updates, including new navigation mechanics.\n\nOf course, that‚Äôs not all. We‚Äôve got other God of War content for your perusal, including a ranking of our five favorite bosses from the franchise. Additionally, Alex Van Aken attended Evo, favorably comparing the storied event to the Olympics. Marcus Stewart got hands-on time with the next entry in the most prominent fighting franchise of all time, Street Fighter 6. There are even a few fantastic freelance pieces ‚Äì one, for instance, documents the meticulous creation of a Cuphead boss fight. And if you‚Äôre wondering what big games are on the horizon, we‚Äôve got you covered with preview pages dedicated to Square Enix‚Äôs role-playing farming sim, Harvestella, Game Freak‚Äôs Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet, and so much more.  \n\n// S U B S C R I B E\nDon't miss any of our video features or exclusive coverage!\nSubscribe to the channel: https://www.YouTube.com/GameInformer?sub_confirmation=1\n\n// FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL\nTwitter | https://www.twitter.com/GameInformer\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/GameInformerMagazine\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/officialgameinformer/\n\n// READ GAME INFORMER MAGAZINE\n1 Year Digital Subscription for $14.98: https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/\n1 Year Physical Subscription for $14.98: https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/\n\n// M E R C H\nShow off your love for Game Informer ‚Äì Stickers, phone cases, mugs, and t-shirts: https://www.gameinformer.com/merch\n\n#godofwar #ps5 #godofwarragnarok","title":"God Of War Ragnar√∂k | Exclusive Cover Reveal Trailer","duration":76,"channel_id":"UCK-65DO2oOxxMwphl2tYtcw","author":"Game Informer","date":"20220830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z98hLrPowUQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z98hLrPowUQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":386453}}

Explore tropical eucalyptus forests, survive scorching deserts, relax at cool billabongs and discover scrubland filled with adorable Aussie inspired wildlife. Collect valuable resources by hunting, mining, fishing and foraging to expand and customise your town and attract new townsfolk and businesses. Share your new home with friends and protect each other as you explore beautiful landscapes filled with dangerous predators.\n\nGo from starting out sleeping in a swag under the stars, to a sprawling town with farms, businesses and attractions. Eventually, you‚Äôll draw in visitors, who might decide to stay and make it their home too.\n\nKeep your neighbours happy by customising your town with fences, flower beds, street lamps, beehives, windmills, hedges, fountains and more. The happier your townsfolk are the more likely they are to settle down, bring their families and set up stores with unique items.\n\nInvite your friends to visit your town where they can help you construct buildings, shop at your stores, go fishing, race Emus, fight crocodiles much more!\n\nThe island is Choc-A-Bloc with insects, fish and minerals. So grab your thongs and go track down and collect them all for your personal museum collection, or sell them for a tidy profit!\n\nCare for and breed chickens, cows and sheep as well as Dinkum‚Äôs iconic Giant Wombats! The Wombats might seem intimidating at first, but really they are sweethearts.\n\nCultivate crops for your town across the whole island, choosing the best spots for each type. Not only do the seasons change, but the temperature shifts depending on where you are on the island\n\nHunt animals for food and defend yourself from deadly predators who are just as hungry as you. Those Roos might seem friendly but they pack a punch!\n\nAttack creatures head on or capture them with traps, it‚Äôs up to you how to survive.\n\nCustomise your character in Dinkum to be the True Blue version of you. Buy that shiny pair of sunnies or wide Akubra hat in the shop, or seek out rare items through exploring the great outdoors and through chinwags with fellow townsfolk.\n\nMake your house your own cosy abode.

{"description":"NASA‚Äôs Space Launch System, which the space agency hopes will take American astronauts back to the moon, has been in development for more than a decade. But today will be the first time NASA attempts to launch the multibillion-dollar rocket, the most powerful NASA has ever built.\nThe development of the SLS has been controversial. Several inspector general reports have dinged the project for being over budget and criticized NASA for paying performance bonuses to the prime contractor, Boeing, even though the project is years behind schedule.\nBut despite those setbacks, Congress has continued to fund the program, which has cost $23 billion and counting ‚Äî far more expensive than the rockets now being used by commercial space companies such as SpaceX. Critics often refer to the SLS as the ‚ÄúSenate Launch System.‚Äù\nWeather or technical issues could force NASA to delay the launch to another day, but when the SLS flies, the space agency says it will mark a major milestone in its ambitious Artemis program to create a sustainable presence on and around the moon.

{"description":"PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/foolishbaseball\nTWEETER: https://twitter.com/FoolishBB\nMERCH: https://shop.jomboymedia.com/collections/foolish-baseball\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nGreg Maddux. That's the legendary player finally making his Baseball Bits debut. The Greg Maddux 76 pitch complete game (or was it the 77 pitch complete game) is somewhat of a legend. It's up to me to separate fact from fiction. Along the way, we make note of how some of Maddux's best features have been exaggerated over the years since his retirement, particularly his Greg Maddux velocity and Greg Maddux strikeouts. We'll also debunk the Greg Maddux 3-0 count stat. \n\nJust be to clear, I love and appreciate all things Greg Maddux. It might seem like I'm being a stickler here, but it's all in the name of accurately describing his legacy. That includes an accurate pitch count from the Greg Maddux July 22 1997 vs Cubs game, as well as heaps of praise for his Greg Maddux defense, value be darned. \n\nA lot of the video is focused on the Greg Maddux Braves years, but I tried to sneak in clips from his tenures with his other clubs as well. The Cubs in particular had Maddux for nearly as long as the Braves, even if Atlanta ultimately had him for his absolute peak. \n\n___________________________________________________\n\nFull game broadcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilahmEByorM\nBox Score: https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN199707221.shtml\nJ.J Cooper on fastball velocity: https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/the-measure-of-a-fastball-has-changed-over-the-years/\n\nSoundtrack from Maxo: \nhttps://soundcloud.com/maxoelectronic\nhttps://maxoisnuts.bandcamp.com/","title":"Greg Maddux‚Äôs 76-pitch complete game is FAKE | Baseball Bits","duration":980,"channel_id":"UCbW12JIVAdi5NugdakbU33A","author":"Foolish Baseball","date":"20220828","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHKo7f99kZE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/WHKo7f99kZE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":481611}}
