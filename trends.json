Thanks SteelSeries for sponsoring the video. \n--\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is what we all feared it might be: a throwback to the old formula, with little effort made to adapt or advance that formula in any way. It might have got across the finish line had the writing done its job, but this is the worst written AC game I've played.

{"description":"Today AD is welcomed by Jon Batiste and Suleika Jaouad to tour their beautiful home in Brooklyn, New York. With multiple Grammys for Batiste’s album 'We Are' and Jaouad’s bestselling book, 'Between Two Kingdoms', this powerhouse couple wanted a home in which they could live and create simultaneously. After viewing close to 70 properties, it was an 1890s Brooklyn Italianate that finally felt like the One. Interior designer Hallie Goodman helped the couple create a soul-filled home, bringing together their Tunisian and New Orleanian roots in what they’ve penned the “Tunisiana” style. But what truly brought their home together was a wedding ceremony–mid-renovation, upon the return of Suleika’s leukemia, the couple tied the knot in their living room. And after a lengthy hospital stay spent scouring the web for thrifted treasures, Batiste and Jaouad’s home was finally ready for a proper homecoming. “I entered the hospital in winter. The day I was discharged was sunny and fully spring. I was weak, in need of a walker to get around, but I was so happy and relieved. As Jon and I made our way through the house, I had tears in my eyes—not just because it far exceeded our expectations. We had finally made it home.”\r\n\r\nJon Batiste and Suleika Jaouad’s original documentary, 'American Symphony', directed by Matthew Heineman, a portrait of two inimitable artists at a crossroad and a profound meditation on art, love, and the creative process will be released by Netflix globally later this year.

To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMB01F5ZJCRFJBFO","title":"We Left for a Cabin in the Woods","duration":1325,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQGWIkKB8l8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JQGWIkKB8l8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":129125}}

{"description":"September 29th, 2023, will be etched in New York City's history as the day the skies opened with an unparalleled ferocity. The deluge was so intense that JFK Airport recorded its highest 24-hour rainfall since 1948, with an astonishing 8 inches pouring down.\n\nBrooklyn faced nature's fury head-on, as three hours of ceaseless rain equaled an entire month's average downpour. Witness water roaring into basements, stranded vehicles, and impassable roads that brought the Big Apple to a standstill.\n\nThis video dives deep into the heart of the devastation, spotlighting the worst affected regions like Brooklyn and Long Island. From shattered rainfall records to streets that became rivers, experience the magnitude of NYC's epic flood crisis.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 $8k per night villa!\n01:27 Royal Villa tour\n02:00 how did we get here?\n03:04 full resort tour: Conrad Bora Bora\n09:00 Kardashian’s stayed here!\n12:18 swimming with manta rays\n16:30 Presidential Villa tour!!🙌🏻\n25:00 Nate attempts to win 5 free nights😍\n27:45 Bloops","title":"We Stayed in Bora Bora's Most Expensive Overwater Villa","duration":1738,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDIp0Vu9iII","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NDIp0Vu9iII/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":831886}}

{"description":"Stephen Thompson | September 29, 2023\nWhat you've got here is a perfect 20-minute distillation of The Sam Smith Experience: The Grammy-winning 2014 ballad that kicked off the singer's career (\"Stay With Me\"), a sleek dance-pop banger (\"How Do You Sleep\") and a chart-topping dollop of debauched hedonism (\"Unholy\") bundled together with \"Lay Me Down,\" in which Smith performed a gorgeous duet with LaDonna Harley-Peters. From the stately to the louche and bawdy — Smith even introduced \"Unholy\" with a perfect summation of their recent artistic direction: \"Let's get saucy!\" — it's all here.\n\nPerforming with an 11-person choir and two instrumentalists — sadly, Kim Petras wasn't there to emerge from between Smith's legs as if she were being birthed — Smith brought an overflowing bag of tricks to the proceedings. But what really shone through was a sense of movement: Each song swayed and played effervescently, centering Smith while also elevating every other magnificent voice in support. This set may not serve as anyone's introduction to the music of Sam Smith, but it's still a hell of a gateway — and a joy to behold.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Stay With Me\"\n\"How Do You Sleep\"\n\"Lay Me Down (feat.

{"description":"Check out the new IMPACT liner from Weathertech here: https://www.weathertech.com/impactliner/\n\nThe 2024 Ford Mustang GT Premium with Performance Package ($54,845 starting in the US, $65,345 in Canada) the Chevrolet Camaro 2SS 1LE ($57,490 starting in the US, $74,160 in Canada) and the Ford F-150 FP700 (~$52,515 starting in the US) are lined up for a high powered drag race and some lap times. How does the new Mustang GT stand up against the tried and true Camaro SS 1LE? And are they both faster than a 700 horsepower supercharged truck in a straight line? Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race! Watch to see what happens! And then subscribe, silly.\n\nThank you to https://www.youtube.com/user/MichelinCanada for donating tires\n\nNO GOATS WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS FILM.
