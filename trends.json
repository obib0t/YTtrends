{"description":"*NSYNC is back, baby—and the iconic boy band is kicking off Season 22 of Hot Ones in epic fashion! Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, JC Chasez, Lance Bass, and Joey Fatone have sold more than 70 million records, toured the world, and endured as one of the defining pop groups of a generation. They're reunited not only for this record-breaking episode (most wings on the table!), but also with a brand-new single, \"Better Place,\" dropping September 29. But how are they with spicy food? Find out as Timberlake and Fatone take on the gauntlet for a second time, and the rest of the band joins them to discuss live-show malfunctions, crazy fan stories, and the definitive Mount Rushmore of *NSYNC songs.\n\nBUY HOT ONES HOT SAUCE NOW: https://fwfea.st/hotsauces\n\nTRY THE HOT ONES BONELESS CHICKEN BITE CHALLENGE: https://fwfea.st/chickenbites\n\nBUY HOT ONES TRUTH OR DAB: THE GAME: http://truthordabgame.com\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE HOT ONES MONTHLY HOT SAUCE SUBSCRIPTION: https://bit.ly/2veY50P\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE FIRST WE FEAST NEWSLETTER: http://firstwefeast.com/signup\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO FIRST WE FEAST ON YOUTUBE: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE BY DONATING TO COMMON THREADS, THE OFFICIAL  CHARITY PARTNER OF HOT ONES: https://www.commonthreads.org/firstwefeast/\n\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\n\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\nhttp://instagram.com/hotones/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast","title":"*NSYNC Breaks Another Record While Eating Spicy Wings | Hot Ones","duration":1437,"channel_id":"UCPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA","author":"First We Feast","date":"20230921","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97SPDxM3Ezw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/97SPDxM3Ezw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3091236}}

We are starting things off by addressing the question everyone has been asking, “does Alix have a boyfriend?” She opens up about how she met NFL man, their first date, navigating public controversy and their current relationship status. Hot Mess is all about providing an authentic glimpse into Alix's life, and that includes introducing you to her friends and family. In this episode, get ready to meet her college BFFs as they reminisce about their early, awkward days and recount some hilarious stories (hint: adventures like sleeping at a middle school and even becoming the school mascot for three weeks). You’ve gotten ready with her, but now it’s time to get real with her. Alix unveils the truth behind the viral TikTok where she went to Drake’s birthday - and it’s not what you think. Lastly, Alix invites you on a final mission that takes her back to her old beloved college home, Casa Amor, where she has an encounter with some frat boys in order to rescue all of her and her friends nudes that were left behind.

{"description":"Pre-order UFC 5 Deluxe Edition: http://x.ea.com/77815\n\nWhat makes an MMA fight? It’s the stakes, technique, drama, and pure reality of the moment. UFC 5 captures that in more authentic detail than ever before, from next-generation graphics upgrades that give gameplay animations new life, damage systems that marry the brutality and strategy of the fight game, gameplay updates that make the action feel even more fluid and realistic, and much more.\n\nIntroducing Authentic Damage in UFC 5: Cuts, bruising, and swelling accumulate in accurate locations based on the damage you inflict and take in-game, including over 64,000 possible combinations of facial damage a fighter can sustain. All damage is now rendered in more detail than ever before, affecting character attributes in a truly genuine fashion. Authentic damage adds a whole new layer of strategic possibilities to the fight. \n\nAuthentic damage comes with authentic results. If the player sustains a significant injury — like a broken nose or swollen eye — the ref can now step in, pause the action, and get the ringside doctor to inspect the damage. \n\nIt’s a striking evolution. UFC 5 features all-new animations for ground and pound elbows, spinning attacks, and several other punches, kicks, knees, and elbows. Plus, new striking animations emulate heavy hitters, professional kickboxers, and more, giving you all new ways to stand and bang. In addition, new hit reaction animations and physics make sure you feel the impact of a clean connection.\n\n\nThe new Seamless Submissions functions as a revamped extension of the existing grappling systems with faster animations and the removal of mini-games. Beginners can use Grapple Assist for help on the canvas, while veterans will have new depths to uncover and enjoy. The new submissions offer a smoother, more authentic ground game that is sure to be a grappler’s delight.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more UFC 5 Trailers: bit.ly/easports_ufc\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsufc \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsufc \nTwitter: https://x.com/easportsufc \n\n\n#UFC5 #Gameplay","title":"UFC 5 Official Gameplay Trailer | Deep Dive ft.

{"description":"Florida was once the iconic swing state. What happened?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nIn 2022, before he began a campaign for the presidency, Ron DeSantis was reelected governor of Florida in a landslide. This was impressive and surprising because the 2022 elections were disappointing for Republicans almost everywhere else in the US. But DeSantis’s overwhelming victory was doubly impressive and surprising because when he had first been elected, just four years earlier, it was by just a tiny margin.\n\nFor a long time, in fact, tiny election margins were the norm in Florida elections. Florida was a “swing state” — it sometimes voted for Democrats, sometimes for Republicans, and was a major prize up for grabs in presidential elections. But by 2022, something had changed: Florida Republicans up and down the ballot won their races by margins similar to DeSantis’s, and no one was calling Florida a swing state anymore.\n\nFlorida seems to have undergone a political transformation. So what happened? In this video, we look at three possible explanations.\n\nChapters: \n0:00 What changed?\n1:49 Defining the question\n2:52 New Floridians\n4:10 Latino voters\n7:05 Florida Democrats\n8:26 The other reasons\n10:09 A request\n\nRead “The United States of Florida,” a contributor-supported project from Vox: https://www.vox.com/culture/23864468/florida-man-invasive-species-republican-disney-publix-miami\n\nWe looked at …. a lot of data for this video. Here are the main sources we used:\n\nCounty-by-county results in Florida elections from 2016-2022 came from the Florida Department of State’s Election Reporting System: https://results.elections.myflorida.com/\n\nThe screenshotted US Census page showing that Miami-Dade is mostly Latino can be found here, under the “data tables” tab: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html\n\nOur map showing the “specific origin” of various states’ Latino populations was inspired by the University of Washington’s Great Migrations Project: https://depts.washington.edu/moving1/map_latinx_migration.shtml\n\nThe data we used for that map came from the US Census via this very helpful tool: https://data.census.gov/table?q=B03001:+HISPANIC+OR+LATINO+ORIGIN+BY+SPECIFIC+ORIGIN\n\nThe chart about Spanish-language ad spending in the 2022 Florida governor’s race came from a post-mortem of the 2022 election by the research firm Equis. You can find it on page 59: https://weareequis.us/api/docs/qV8T7OpIWxw54fYWr9F0M/d1ecc7309b286d6b7db60d7f140f3b4f/2022_Post-Mortem_June_14.pdf\n\nAnd now for the big red bars. The Florida state party expenditures came from Transparency USA, an organization that tracks state-level campaign finance data. That data for Florida Republicans is here: https://www.transparencyusa.org/fl/committee/republican-party-of-florida-4700-pty\nAnd Democratic state party expenditures are here: https://www.transparencyusa.org/fl/committee/florida-democratic-party-1539-pty\n\nThe data on the best-funded state parties is from OpenSecrets, another org that tracks campaign finance data: https://www.opensecrets.org/political-parties/top-committees?cycle=2022&party=A&type=R\n\nThe chart at the end, which compiles spending from the national Democratic Party, was also based on information from OpenSecrets: https://www.opensecrets.org/political-parties\n\nAnd the data on how much the state parties raised came from Florida Department of State’s campaign finance database: https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/campaign-finance/contributions/\n\nThe line chart that shows total voter registrations for each party is based on data that Florida’s Division of Elections makes public: https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-reports/voter-registration-by-party-affiliation/\n\nFinally, the data around voters who moved to a new state and new Florida registrations from 2020-2023 came from the data vendor L2: https://www.l2datamapping.com/\n\nVox is an explanatory newsroom on a mission to help everyone understand our weird, wonderful, complicated world, so that we can all help shape it.

We are so proud of how far we've come with this (mostly) DIY project and couldn't be happier to be raising a beautiful new baby out here in the woods. Is there honestly anything better than being in nature, getting your toes in the dirt and swimming in Canadian fresh water lakes? The only dilemma is that this cabin is barely big enough for the the 3 of us.... let alone the many guests and additional family members that we like to host as well. \n\nJoin us this week as we turn our empty loft space into a beautiful guest bedroom. We think it's so cozy and inviting that we might even move up there!!\n\n#cabininthewoods #roomrenovation #loftdesign","title":"We Added a New Bedroom to Our Cabin","duration":1988,"channel_id":"UC4laAHbk8VSgmvB47tsd2XQ","author":"Eamon & Bec","date":"20230917","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj_shEbfE58","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uj_shEbfE58/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":546741}}

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

{"description":"Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances – either side if the interval – and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n______FAQs_______\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 3:\nhttps://amzn.to/3OQpfEJ\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nOfficial Amazon Store:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/MoriahElizabeth/page/84A1B7AA-51AC-4B6B-AD8D-A20CCD5FCB47?ref_=ast_bln\n\nME Nail Polish\nslatebrands.com/menails\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.
