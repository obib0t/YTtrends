Valencia wasn’t done there, as he scored his second goal in the 31st minute.

{"description":"Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 | The Bloody Lie (2022)\n\nFor more than a decade Elizabeth Holmes spun a despicable bloody lie. She told the world she’d invented a medical miracle. It was a machine which, with a tiny drop of blood, could almost instantly diagnose myriad diseases. Holmes promised to revolutionise healthcare, and in doing so fooled many wealthy investors. It led to her becoming a darling of Silicon Valley and an inspirational billionaire. But when whistle-blowers started questioning her claims, Holmes’ fairytale, along with her company Theranos, was destroyed. Earlier this year, Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty of fraud. Now it’s judgement day as she discovers her punishment.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

{"description":"Discrete convolutions, from probability, to image processing and FFTs.\nHelp fund future projects: https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown​\nSpecial thanks to these supporters: https://3b1b.co/lessons/convolutions#thanks\nAn equally valuable form of support is to simply share the videos.\n\n------------------\n\nOther videos I referenced\n\nLive lecture on image convolutions for the MIT Julia lab\nhttps://youtu.be/8rrHTtUzyZA\n\nLecture on Discrete Fourier Transforms\nhttps://youtu.be/g8RkArhtCc4\n\nReducible video on FFTs\nhttps://youtu.be/h7apO7q16V0\n\nVeritasium video on FFTs\nhttps://youtu.be/nmgFG7PUHfo\n\nA small correction for the integer multiplication algorithm mentioned at the end. A “straightforward” application of FFT results in a runtime of O(N * log(n) log(log(n)) ). That log(log(n)) term is tiny, but it is only recently in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven found an algorithm that removed that log(log(n)) term.\n\nAnother small correction at 17:00. I describe O(N^2) as meaning \"the number of operations needed scales with N^2\". However, this is technically what Theta(N^2) would mean. O(N^2) would mean that the number of operations needed is at most constant times N^2, in particular, it includes algorithms whose runtimes don't actually have any N^2 term, but which are bounded by it. The distinction doesn't matter in this case, since there is an explicit N^2 term.\n\nThese animations are largely made using a custom python library, manim.

We ran our first test piece early because we were at a stage where we needed more cables from viewers -- we got some! With the help of our audience sending in a few failed cables, we were able to reach 3 firm conclusions (or, really, 2+1) of causes for failures of these adapter cables (and unadapted ones, too). Of course, there may be even more reasons -- but we believe these 3 to be the primary ones. Between foreign object debris in manufacturing (seems uncommon, but a cause) and user error, we were able to make a few cables melt. On the user error front, remember one key thing: Even if yours doesn't start fully unseated and is only partly unseated, it can work its way loose over time if you move cables around, do some cleanup, move the system, etc.\n\nWatch our first video in this series! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIKjZ1djp8c\n\nNew GN 3D Coaster Pack: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-drink-debug-coaster-pack-4-custom-3d-coasters-100x100mm-4x4\nGN PC Building Anti-Static Modmat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat-volt-large\nGN Red & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-red-black-hud-mouse-mat\nGN Blue & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-wireframe-mouse-mat\n\r\nLike our content?

That’s why I was absolutely stoked when I got a call from none other than Karl Jacobs asking me if I could build him a giant computer so that he could beat Minecraft on it. You see I have a habit of building the most insane builds on YouTube like transforming my bedroom into a cereal bowl, building Squid Game doll for MrBeast, and building giant boxing gloves for Jake Paul. That’s why it was a no brainer for me to not only make Karl a giant computer, but to make him the WORLD’S LARGEST computer! if you don’t know Karl he is the largest gaming creator in the world, largest Twitch streamer, and a main character in many MrBeast videos. This project was absolutely insane to make and we definetly bit off more than we could chew, but it turned out amazing in the end and Karl’s reaction was priceless. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one!

{"description":"Just in time for Valentine’s Day comes the third installment of the \nblockbuster “Magic Mike” film franchise, the musical comedy “Magic Mike’s Last \nDance.” The creative team behind the first film, which garnered praise from critics \nand audiences alike, has reunited to create the magic again: Channing Tatum \nreprises his role as Mike Lane and Steven Soderbergh returns to the helm with a \nscript from Reid Carolin, who also wrote the first two films. And starring alongside \nTatum is Salma Hayek Pinault (“House of Gucci,” “Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard”).\n“Magic” Mike Lane (Tatum) takes to the stage again after a lengthy hiatus, \nfollowing a business deal that went bust, leaving him broke and taking \nbartender gigs in Florida. For what he hopes will be one last hurrah, Mike heads \nto London with a wealthy socialite (Hayek Pinault) who lures him with an offer he \ncan’t refuse…and an agenda all her own. With everything on the line, once Mike \ndiscovers what she truly has in mind, will he—and the roster of hot new dancers \nhe’ll have to whip into shape—be able to pull it off?\nThe film’s producers are Nick Wechsler, Gregory Jacobs, Tatum, Carolin and \nPeter Kiernan. Julie M. Anderson serves as executive producer.\nAlso starring with Tatum and Hayek Pinault are Ayub Khan Din (“Ackley \nBridge”), newcomer Jemelia George, Juliette Motamed (“We Are Lady Parts”) \nand Vicki Pepperdine (“Johnny English Strikes Again”).\nSoderbergh’s creative team behind the scenes includes production \ndesigner Pat Campbell (“The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself”), costume designer \nChristopher Peterson (“The Irishman”) and music supervisor Season Kent (“KIMI,” \n“Let Them All Talk”), with choreography by Alison Faulk and Luke Broadlick, both \npart of the “Magic Mike” franchise.\nA Warner Bros. Pictures Presentation, “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” slides into \ntheaters only in North America on February 10, 2023 and internationally beginning \n8 February 2023, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures","title":"Magic Mike’s Last Dance | Official Trailer","duration":141,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.
