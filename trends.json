{"description":"In this Mumbo Jumbo Minecraft, I put my new Max Spec M1 Ultra Apple Mac Studio that cost $7000 to the test, with Minecraft. Can you play Minecraft on a Mac? I guess this is the ultimate answer to that question. This M1 Ultra Mac Studio with 20 cores and 64 GPU cores gets tested with Minecraft Single Player worlds, Minecraft TNT explosions and even gets trialed on the Hermitcraft server. \n\nWHY DID I GET A MAC STUDIO?\nI'm not just a Minecraft YouTuber. I'm a filmmaker who works on commercials, narrative and documentaries. I also love to travel, and be out in remote places to shoot photos, hike and explore.\nI wanted a desktop powerhouse that could fit into a single flight case and be transported to any location in the world, allowing me to live and work wherever I want. \n\nThe system needed to:\n1. Run Minecraft at a good enough level to record videos\n2. Handle colour graded cinema camera files, and edit with them no dropped frames.\n3. Have a large number of high speed I/O ports to deal with multiple large data transfers at once. \n4. Be silent for recording audio in potentially small places (This is what ruled out most gaming laptops!)\n5. Fit in a flight case, with the system, display, and flight case combination weighing under 20KG to be within the weight allowance for checked luggage on flights.\n6. Be durable enough to be thrown on a plane, in the back of a van, in my backpack. \n\nFilming channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatMumboJumbo2\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialmumbo/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatMumboJumbo","title":"Minecraft vs $7000 Apple Mac Studio","duration":625,"channel_id":"UChFur_NwVSbUozOcF_F2kMg","author":"Mumbo Jumbo","date":"20230103","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qUMtTcIWpM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/3qUMtTcIWpM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":694205}}

It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet¬≠to¬≠be¬≠dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms. #Roblox‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã #Numberskull‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã","title":"Phoenix Awakened Made Me INVINCIBLE...

Although many dams use uncontrolled spillways, gated spillways provide more control over the flow, allowing us to build smaller, more cost-effective structures. There are countless arrangements of mechanical devices that have been used across the world and throughout history to manage the flow of water. But, modern engineering has coalesced to variations on only a few different kinds of gates.\n\nWant a book or a t-shirt? https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Running up that hill with 8 billion people.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn 2022, the world population crossed 8 billion people ‚Äî and we felt the scale of this monumental milestone in hundreds of ways. After over two years of lockdowns and quarantines, people eagerly restarted their lives, but there were certainly growing pains. Weddings and travel skyrocketed, but so did lost luggage and global inflation rates. Taylor Swift broke Ticketmaster. Cryptocurrency was headed toward a great year until it really, really wasn‚Äôt. 2022 tested the world population as we tested out life in a new phase of the pandemic.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine, and aid relief flooded into the war-torn country. Refugees were welcomed into surrounding countries, and those who stayed behind inspired people around the world. Global protests cried out for justice in Iran. Football teams stood up for migrant workers and the LGBTQ+ community at the World Cup. Cuba legalized same-sex marriage. The world froze for a moment when England‚Äôs longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, died. And we all watched a lot of TikTok. \n\nAs we head into 2023, take a moment to look back at the events that defined this year.\n\nFor more on 2022 from Vox.com:\n\nAlissa Wilkinson‚Äôs The 25 best movies of 2022: https://www.vox.com/culture/23484805/best-movies-2022-streaming-theaters\n\nConstance Grady‚Äôs Vox‚Äôs 16 best books of 2022: https://www.vox.com/culture/23500142/best-books-2022-if-i-survive-you-vladimir-furrows-lessons-either-or-ducks-joan-is-okay-shy-hotbed\n\nMarin Cogan‚Äôs Antisemitism isn‚Äôt new.
