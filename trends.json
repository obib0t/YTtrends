And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS! After many weeks... here is the video that almost defeated me, the grand finale of our Vegas trip - where we ate at every celebrity chef restaurant on the Vegas strip! Now as some of you all may know, Tyler and I are big Food Network fans - and while we were in Vegas, we decided to visit one of every celebrity chef's restaurant on the Strip! We stuffed our faces with numerous dishes, from the trash can-iest nachos at Guy Fieri's, to the elegant Italian pasta of Giada de Laurentiis, to the famed Beef Wellington at Gordon Ramsay's. Which restaurant would you try? Should we do a part 2 and go to the Jonas Brothers' restaurant?\n\nAlso, there is some controversy around foie gras that we weren't aware of before filming, our apologies.

Iron bacteria lives by oxidizing dissolved iron 2 oxide in the water table, converting it to insoluble iron 3 oxide, which precipitates out of solution forming an orange slime. This material can be concentrated to a paste that can be shaped into objects. After drying out completely, the material becomes insoluble in water just as cement does.\n\nI don't know for sure why it does this but I suspect that while it's wet, there's still some dissolved iron 2 oxide in the material. When air gets to the iron 2 oxide and converts it to iron 3 oxide it precipitates out. It then becomes a solid, cementing itself to the other iron 3 already present. This is probably why iron bacteria sometimes forms solid lumps known as bog ore. Bog ore was once primarily used for smelting into iron but was also occasionally used as a building material (not as a cement but as solid building blocks).\n\nThe potential use for this material could be as a cement-like material or mortar used in structures when iron bacteria can be found in large quantities. Fire is not used in the process as is the case with limestone or wood ash cement, and so reduces fuel consumption. It may be an appropriate use for iron bacteria contaminated with mud that might otherwise be unsuitable for smelting. Aggregates such as sand and gravel could also be added to bulk out the volume. More experiments need to be made.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #Cement #Iron","title":"Primitive Technology: Iron Bacteria Cement (no fire/water insoluble)","duration":336,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230302","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9irICRnszOc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9irICRnszOc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1107874}}

{"description":"Our #Crew6 mission to the International Space Station is targeted for liftoff at 12:34 a.m. EST (0534 UTC) on Thursday, March 2, 2023, from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Feb. 27 launch attempt was scrubbed so mission teams could investigate a ground systems issue. NASA astronauts Stephen Bowen and Warren \"Woody\" Hoburg, as well as UAE (United Arab Emirates) astronaut Sultan Alneyadi and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev, will launch aboard their Dragon Endeavour spacecraft atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \n\nVisit our Crew-6 blog for the latest mission updates: https://blogs.nasa.gov/crew-6/ \n\nThis will be the fourth trip to space for Bowen, the Crew-6 mission commander, and the first space launch for the rest of the crew. They'll spend approximately six months on the station, helping us learn how to live in space while conducting research to make life better back on Earth. Learn more about the mission, its crew, and some of the science they'll be working on at https://go.nasa.gov/3jclMmJ. \n\nFollowing launch and ascent, NASA coverage of agency‚Äôs Crew-6 flight to the space station will temporarily switch to a streaming, audio-only feed accessible via YouTube, between ascent and the beginning of rendezvous operations.

This will cause all sorts of problems in Russian-held territory: it will flood the area downstream, it will limit the irrigation of agricultural fields to the south, and it might limit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's ability to cool itself. Why is Russia doing this? The straightforward answer is that it will reduce Ukraine's ability to initiate an attack in Kherson, thereby freeing up Russian soldiers to pursue an offensive in the north. But it also hints at the possibility that Russia is running low on soldiers, otherwise Moscow would not be willing to incur these costs.\n\n0:00 Does Russia Have a Manpower Shortage?\n0:48 The Draining of the Kakhovka Dam and Reservoir\n2:18 Why Would Russia Release the Dam?\n4:00 Where the Flood Goes\n5:19 Irrigation Problems\n6:54 The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Problem\n8:22 Why Russia Is Probably Running out of Soldiers\n10:04 Or Maybe Russia WAS Running out of Soldiers\n11:30 Is the Russian Winter Offensive a Failure?\n12:59 Boris Johnson's Tie\n\nThe appearance of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) visual information does not imply or constitute DoD endorsement.\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY 2.0: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/):\n\nBy IAEA:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/52339383057/in/album-72177720301779673/\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/):\n\nBy IAEA:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/8506930028\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/11083570446\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/):\n\nBy Kremlin.ru:\nhttp://kremlin.ru/news/20604\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/50329\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/57436\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/60490\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/62249\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/security-council/62933\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67061\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69390\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69465\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69737\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69743\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69756\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69800\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70159\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70315\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70341\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70414\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70565","title":"Russia Just Took a Big Dam Risk.

{"description":"as we begin the first episode of the mandalorian season 3, we get the armorer crafting a new mandalorian helmet, ceremoniously welcoming a young mandalorian boy into their creed of mandalorian‚Äôs which are the children of the watch. The same as Djin Darin. We also see Paz Vizsla there amongst them, who helped Mando in the first season. He‚Äôs pretty cool with his gattling gun. He also is a direct descendant of Tarre Vizsla I assume as they have the same last name. Tarre Vizsla was the first jedi mandalorian, whom i believe Grogu will follow suit eventually. Now, this creed is different from other mandalorian sects, in which a mando cannot remove one‚Äôs helmet in the presence of any sentient being. As they say their creed and swear on the names of their ancestors that they shall walk the way of the mandalore, a massive sea monster emerges from the ocean, giving major jurassic park meets star wars vibes. \n\nSeeking retribution for his good will, we walks into the cave of the armorer where she says you removed your helmet, you are no longer a mandalorian. if we remember from the book of boba fett, he told her this and she said he‚Äôs no longer a mandalorian for this. The reason behind this is because they‚Äôre very traditional, they‚Äôre not like new mandalorians like bo katan who follow a more relaxed ideology and much less superstitious, but also to protect them by hiding their numbers. For it‚Äôs hard to track numbers by helmet as they can all look similar, but it‚Äôs easy to count by faces.\n\nShe says redemption is no longer possible since the destruction of mandalore.\n\nHe shows her a piece of crystal from Mandalore that Jawas bought from a random traveler. She is stunned to see it as it‚Äôs impossible for anyone to take anything from Mandalore, as setting foot on the planet would kill them as it is poisoned. Clearly, it hasn‚Äôt been, since he now has this proof.\nShe says this proves that mandalore‚Äôs surface has been crystalized by fusion rays, from all the bombing from the night of a thousand tears.\n\nThey leave to Navarro 7 in hyperspace, as Grogu looks out the window to notice massive space whales travelling with them in hyperspace. These are the Purgil we was from star wars rebels who helped Ezra and took him to an unknown place, along with Thrawn. I like how they showed this, it was a nice scene, and connects Ezra, Ahsoka, and Thrawn to the timeline. Maybe we‚Äôll see them in this season of the mandalorian, maybe we will in Ahsoka‚Äôs show only. I guess we‚Äôll see.\n\nThey head to Navarro 7 where we meet up with Greef Carga again, as he lands down and the town looks really clean and rennovated. Lots of life, merchants, aliens from all over. It‚Äôs buzzing with droids and beings. It looks great and very star wars, unlike Kenobi which barely had any aliens in it.\n\nWe come up to the IG-11 droid statue, where his parts have been salvaged as much as possible, and he stands as a becaon of hope to all for his efforts.\n\nGrogu uses the force to spin his chair, which is the same thing Yoda did in revenge of the sith at the end of the film on polis massa, albeit he wasn‚Äôt doing it for fun, he just had to turn to talk to Obi-Wan and Bail Organa as his feet are too short to touch the ground.\n\nThey walk off and Mando gets offered the job of Ranger where he asks about Cara Dune, where it‚Äôs revealed she was promoted to special forces when she brought Moff Gideon in. It‚Äôs a better send off for Cara than saying she‚Äôs dead or something, but I still wish she was in the show and that Gina didn‚Äôt get fired. Moff Gideon was sent to a New Republic War Tribunal.\n\nHeading to his final destination of the episode, Mando and Grogu arrive to kalevala, another planet in the mandalorian system and home to house Kryze as they come to a Mandalorian Castle‚Ä¶where Bo Katan is kicking her feet up on her empty throne, alone. They gave her a new wig this season and it looks very much like her animated form.\n\nShe‚Äôs melancholy because when she arrived back to her people without the dark saber, she lost all respect and her authority to lead them. She‚Äôs mad about it, and blames the children of the watch and all factions before it for dividing their people, instead of uniting them. She is of the new mandalorians who don‚Äôt care for such trivial uptight traditions like forbidding ones from removing helmets.\n\nShe says goodbye din djarrin in a nefarious tone‚Ä¶either she gave him some wack gps location where he‚Äôs gonna get killed, or she really thinks the planet is poisoned and he won‚Äôt make it out alive. Either way, she‚Äôll probably go there to scoop up the dark saber from his lifeless body. The way she said goodbye with that jealous and angry tone, really makes her a questionable character now‚Ä¶is she an ally, neutral, or foe‚Ä¶i guess we‚Äôll find out next episode.\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 1 BREAKDOWN - STAR WARS IS BACK","duration":951,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20230301","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsj7FBeo0Sg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qsj7FBeo0Sg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":305624}}

{"description":"SPONSOR INFO\nI'd like to give a huge thank you to Ground News for sponsoring today's video. Compare news coverage. Spot media bias. Avoid algorithms. Be well informed. Download the free Ground News app at https://ground.news/miniminuteman\n\nVIDEO INFO\nHowdy friends! In this video, we begin our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence for it.\n\nADDENDUM: At 48:00 I mistakenly class the Zigurrat at Ur as a burial structure. In reality, the Ziggurat was a temple to the Goddess of the moon. In research I got this crossed with the Royal Cemetary at Ur.

{"description":"Welcome to Sons Of The Forest! The much anticipated sequel to perfectly balanced survival game The Forrest. Similar to that game this one is rammed with various bugs, glitches and exploits that allow you to dupe items and break the laws of physics! Today we will be doing just that by showing one of the fastest and easiest ways to beat the game using just a stick! That's right, this entire 20+ hour game can be beaten with just a stick as sticks allow you to faze through reality. This is rather similar to an exploit in the forest that allowed you to speedrun through all of the locked keycard doors in the game! \n\nToday I will be crossing the entire survival island bypassing the keycard door into the underground lab. Skipping the 3d printing section and going straight for the endgame by sticking my way through the super special final secret door! Sure you might watch a beginer tips and tricks video telling you what to do and how to play the game. Or you could watch The Spiffing Brit explain how to break the laws of reality and bypass all of that fun sons of the forest gameplay with a good old fashion stick take that ign! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:40 - Crash Landing\n01:55 - We're off on an adventure!\n05:23 - The British Space Program\n08:25 - A Stick-y situation\n10:03 - Thinking outside the box\n11:31 - Spelunking\n14:12 - Finishing the Game\n16:36 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nDisclaimer: I am not sure who first discovered the stick glitch as I am 90% certain I am not the first to learn you can glitch the doors using sticks in both of the games. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: How I Beat SONS OF THE FOREST...
