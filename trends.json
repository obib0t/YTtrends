Buy houses in the city, decorate them and increase their value. Earn income by advertising these houses for rent or for sale. Don't forget to use your bargaining skills!\n\n\nConstruction Vacant land is opportunity! Buy these plots and build your dream house! Construction workers will help you build the house you want.\n\nCustomers are coming! Negotiate and try to get the best offer. Try to deal with reputable clients. When the rent day comes, you have to go to the houses and collect the rent money from the tenants, but some customers may not pay the rent. However, if you have a bank account, the rent money will be deposited into your account. Don't forget to check regularly. If you have a problem with a tenant, you can contact a lawyer and sue or try to collect the rent money in other ways. You can even beat them up!\n\n\n\n\nNews Centre You need to keep up with what's happening in the city. Neighbourhood factors affect rental prices.

Maybe it will help you to hear what is being said at the next table.\n\n\nAfter a tiring day, watch your favorite movie, relax and raise your relationship level with your partner.\n\n\nCan you drive a van? Go to the dealer in the city, buy the stuff and increase the value of the house you want to rent out. Be careful not to forget to take your lorry with you, the stuff is quite heavy.\n\n\nEntertainment: You deserve to have some fun too! Try to discover the venues in the city. In some places you will have fun and earn money at the same time.","title":"How I Made $3,262,221,056 Ruining the Real Estate Market - Estate Agent Simulator","duration":1757,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20231118","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSk8ltE6Nts","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sSk8ltE6Nts/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1520676}}

{"description":"This is the second fully integrated full stack test flight of Starship and the mighty Super Heavy booster, the largest and most most powerful rocket to ever fly. It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. \n\nThe goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-2 in April 20th which didn't make it to stage separation while also hoping the improvements to the launch pad hold up better than the previous attempt. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter near Hawaii about 90 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, nearly completing an orbit of the Earth. This would allow the teams to test the reentry profile and heat shields for the first time from orbital velocities. \n\nWant more information?

{"description":"SpaceX is targeting Saturday for the second flight of Starship. The company has received regulatory approval for the flight. The flight will feature the newly added hot staging ring, allowing the Ship to separate from the Booster while the Booster engines are still firing. The stack features multiple upgrades compared to the first flight, including 63 upgrades SpaceX submitted to the FAA to mitigate issues from the first flight. Ahead of the launch, SpaceX will close the road, evacuate the village and surrounding area, and clear the potential blast radius. \n\nBooster 9 will attempt a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while Ship 25 will attempt to fly around the earth before performing a reentry and hard splashdown in the Hawaiian area. \n\nWindow Opens: November 18th at 7AM CST (13:00 UTC)\nWindow Closes: November 18th at 7:20AM CST (13:20 UTC)\n\nMission: Starship's second fully integrated test flight \nVehicles: Booster 9 and Ship 25\nRecovery: No recovery.

After a mere eight minutes of FP1, the session was red-flagged and eventually the Vegas GP practice (FP1) cancelled due to a safety issue. This caused massive delays throughout the night and caused Vegas FP2 delays!\n\nCarlos Sainz was the victom of the Vegas manhole cover, hitting it at high speed and causing significant damage to his Ferrari. The impact was so severe that it cracked his chassis, requiring a replacement. As a result of the incident the FIA decided on a Carlos Sainz grid penalty.\n\nThese Vegas GP delays left F1 fans unhappy with the situation, many of whom had paid top dollar for tickets to the event. Prior to the Las Vegas FP2, a majority of F1 fans forced to leave the track early as well - missing out on alsmot all the track action.\n\n#f1 #f12023 #f1lasvegas #lasvegasgp #vegasgp \n\nTo find out more about how a Manhole ruins Vegas F1, watch the full video now!\n\nPurchase a hand-signed F1 driver print here: https://www.kymillman.com/signed-f1-driver-photos/?v=635f407d621de\n\nBecome a channel member and receive monthly free wallpapers, RAW image files after each race, Exclusive videos and discounts at my store.

{"description":"HELLO! TerminalMontage just released another Pokemon Battle Royale! And once again I helped by doing the research and writing. Now in THIS video, I'm going to explain some of the finer details, as well as why certain things happen, including why certain Pokemon fared so well and even won! \n\nWatch (or re-watch, or re-re-watch) the Original! ‚û§ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl-Okv32Cg0\n\nWoah we've got MERCH!  ‚û§   https://www.gnoggin.net/\n\nSocials:\nXitter  ‚û§   http://twitter.com/Lockstin\nThreads ‚û§  https://www.threads.net/@lockstin_gnoggin\nInstagram ‚û§ https://goo.gl/zmJDxr\n\nAdditional Credits:\nWriter/Host: Lockstin Austin Lockwood\nVideo Edtor: Fineapple Ryan Porter\nOriginal Video Animation:  @TerminalMontage and the team.\n\n#pokemon #pokemonexplained #somethingseries \n\nChapters:\n00:00 Oh yeah! New Battle Royale!\n00:47 Why No Sylveon or Raichu?\n01:21 Explaining Bits of the Battle!\n09:05 Why the Fire Types?\n14:14 Why Pikachu V Blaziken?\n\nGnoggin, hosted by its creator Lockstin, is a show delving into the mysteries of Pokemon! (and other games sometimes too). Explaining everything there is to explain! Why is each Pokemon given the type it has? What are their origins? What is the lore of the Pokemon world and the design inspirations? And what does it all have to do with alchemy? Let's Go find out!\n\nBonus deleted scenes for the bottom of the description!\n     One joke I wrote but Jeremy (rightfully) cut was Eevee finding a Waterstone, looking at it with vehement disgust, and then moving on... if you know you know.  \n         Serperior and Quaquaval originally had a much more intense... binding moment... it was reduced to under a second for your sake... I, I really don't know what was going on with me while writing this one...\n\nYou'll notice there's a semi-secret second Eevee at the end of the Eeveeloutions scene. Earlier drafts of this royale feature multiple copies of some of the starters, such as Partner Pikachu AND regular Pikachu from Yellow, or 2 different Rowlets for example, one for Sun and Moon, and one for Legends Arceus. The semi-secret second Eevee has a Katana, it's the Eevee from Conquest specifically, it was left as just a small visual gag/nod to that. Also at one point, I considered including the many starter Pokemon from Pokemon Battle Revolution too, but ultimately that would add too many Pokemon that most people would just be confused by... So we left it to the main game's Starter Pokemon.","title":"EXPLAINING The Starter Pokemon Battle Royale from @TerminalMontage! üí•","duration":1448,"channel_id":"UC6sjkvDzyY0J8o7k2Kc5rEw","author":"Lockstin & Gnoggin","date":"20231115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_VHfcpNcPA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1_VHfcpNcPA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":860354}}

{"description":"Explore a bustling new world and get up close and personal with neighbors in The Sims‚Ñ¢ 4 For Rent Expansion Pack*, launching Dec 7 at 10 a.m. PT. Pre-order or buy through January 18 to get the Street Eats Digital Content**! (This content will become available when the pack launches.) Pre-order now: https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-for-rent-expansion-pack \n \nThere‚Äôs a new way for Sims to generate income ‚Äì by investing in Residential Rentals. As a property owner your Sim can live among their tenants and be a hands-on property manager, or they can live away from their investment in a separate residence. But don‚Äôt let them get passive about this income stream! Property owners will have to keep their unit ratings high through regular maintenance or they could wind up dealing with a Tenant Revolt.\n \nResidential Rentals are more than just a way for savvy Sims to make Simoleons; they‚Äôre a way to bring communities together and tell new kinds of stories. Maybe your Sim is starting fresh in a basement suite, or maybe two young Sims become sweethearts after growing up in different units of the same duplex. You can now divide lots into multiple units, which creates new possibilities for what you can build. It also means different families will be living on the same lot and have plenty of chances to interact with each other.\n \nYour Sims can bond with their neighbors, chatting by the mailboxes in their apartment building or enjoying food together at a potluck. Or, they can seize the opportunity to dig up dirt on everyone around them. Eavesdropping, snooping, and breaking into their neighbors units are all on the table.\n \nAvailable Dec 7 at 10 a.m. PT on Origin PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation¬Æ4, and PlayStation¬Æ5. \n \nPre-order now: https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-for-rent-expansion-pack\n \n*Requires The Sims 4 & all game updates.

{"description":"Every now and then the F1 organisers throw a spanner in the works - and we typically get a very unusual Grand Prix. And that‚Äôs likely to be true for the first race on the new circuit in Las Vegas. \n\nIt‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs a street track and the race starts at 10pm local time. But the biggest challenge for the teams is that at that time, it‚Äôs going to be cold‚Ä¶ really cold. \n\nSo, why is the drastically colder than usual temperature such an issue? What are the teams and drivers going to do about it? And are we going to see an incredibly chaotic race?\n\nFormula One cars really don‚Äôt work well at cold temperatures. Now, this is counterintuitive. You might notice that all of the fastest laps at your local kart track were set in the evening or at night. But in F1, the power units and in particular, the tyres just aren‚Äôt made to work when temperatures are below about 15 degrees celsius. \n\nAnd you might ask, why? Well, the vast majority of the season is within a fairly tight temperature band, within the mid to high 20 degrees C range - and it has been for a while. \n\nüìπ All source footage can be found here üëâ https://bit.ly/3QYhEoB \n\n‚û§Follow Driver61 on:\n   ‚û§ Instagram- @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n   ‚û§TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok\n\n‚û§ Follow Scott on:\n   ‚û§ Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell\n   ‚û§ Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n\n#Formula1 #LasVegasGP #F1","title":"Why Formula 1 Cars are IMPOSSIBLE to Drive in the COLD","duration":595,"channel_id":"UCtbLA0YM6EpwUQhFUyPQU9Q","author":"Driver61","date":"20231115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc6KAPqpRPY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/oc6KAPqpRPY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":609570}}
