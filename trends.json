Legendary Pictures’ cinematic Monsterverse follows up the explosive showdown of “Godzilla vs. Kong” with an all-new adventure that pits the almighty Kong and the fearsome Godzilla against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world, challenging their very existence—and our own. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” delves further into the histories of these Titans and their origins, as well as the mysteries of Skull Island and beyond, while uncovering the mythic battle that helped forge these extraordinary beings and tied them to humankind forever.\n\nOnce again at the helm is director Adam Wingard.  The film stars Rebecca Hall (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” The Night House”), Brian Tyree Henry (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “Bullet Train”), Dan Stevens (“Gaslit,” “Legion,” “Beauty and the Beast”), Kaylee Hottle (“Godzilla vs. Kong”), Alex Ferns (“The Batman,” “Wrath of Man,” “Chernobyl”) and Fala Chen (“Irma Vep,” “Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”).\n\nThe screenplay is by Terry Rossio (“Godzilla vs. Kong” the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series) and Simon Barrett (“You’re Next”) and Jeremy Slater (“Moon Knight”), from a story by Rossio & Wingard & Barrett, based on the character “Godzilla” owned and created by TOHO Co., Ltd..  The film is produced by Mary Parent, Alex Garcia, Eric Mcleod, Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni and Brian Rogers.  The executive producers are Wingard, Jen Conroy, Jay Ashenfelter, Yoshimitsu Banno, Kenji Okuhira. \n\nOnce again, Wingard is collaborating with director of photography Ben Seresin (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “World War Z”), production designer Tom Hammock (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “X,” “The Guest”), editor Josh Schaeffer (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “Molly’s Game”), costume designer Emily Seresin (“The Invisible Man,” “Top of the Lake”).  The composers are Tom Holkenborg (“Godzilla vs. Kong,” “Mad Max: Fury Road”) and Antonio Di Iorio (additional music on “Godzilla vs. Kong,” the “Sonic the Hedgehog” films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present a Legendary Pictures Production, A Film By Adam Wingard, “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.”  It is slated for release nationwide only in theaters and IMAX on April 12, 2024 and beginning 10 April 2024 internationally, distributed by Warner Bros.

Klatt then goes through how the sport got to this point with the era of the 4-team Playoff format and how it has hurt the sport as a whole.

{"description":"Be sure to check out today’s episode of Game Theory, where this song features! https://youtu.be/3JZeI9SF0lI\n\nAll new Stupendi-Merch NOW AVAILABLE!\nhttps://freshstore.co/collections/the-stupendium\n\nGame Theory, along with its host Matthew ‘MatPat’ Patrick, is a channel that every week takes you on a deep dive behind the lore and the science of your favourite games. I’ve never done a collaboration like this before but it was wonderful to get the chance to work with and promote a smaller, up-and-coming channel. I’ve no doubt you’ll all be hearing about them any day now. I see big things!\n\nIn all seriousness though, WOW. As a long-time fan of the theory channels getting to work on this with MatPat and his team was such an honour. This project has been in the works for the longest time and it’s been so hard to keep it a secret for all this time! (Wondering why there are no Style Theory lyrics? That channel didn’t exist when this was written!)\n\nI am so incredibly grateful to the whole theory team for this opportunity. In fact, I’m doubly thankful because when I initially pitched this project to them the idea was that I would have the song to publish on my music platforms but that the music video would go to the Game Theory channel. But after work on the project began MatPat said he wanted to find a way to make sure the collaboration benefited my channel as much as possible, instead gifting the full music video to my channel even though it had been entirely edited by the Game Theory team. (Shout out to the wonderfully talented Tyler Mascola!)\n\nSo, instead a plan was formulated to feature the music video as part of a larger Theory video whilst the full standalone music video would be here! I cannot express enough my gratitude to Matt and the whole team. Every one of them was a joy to work with as we put this together.\n\nSo, if you’re new here, joining me from today’s video over on Game Theory, welcome! I hope you like what you find!\n\nA̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶b̶s̶o̶l̶u̶t̶e̶l̶y̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶.̶\n\n#gametheory #matpat\n\n-----\nCheck out the full Stupendium originals playlist for all of my original songs!\n\nSTUPENDIUM ORIGINALS: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA&si=dAL0rsUtYfPoESB5\n\nTHE STUPENDIUM ON SPOTIFY:\nhttp://bit.ly/Stupendify\n\nTHE STUPENDIUM ON iTUNES:\nhttp://bit.ly/StupendiTunes\n\nLyrics and vocals by The Stupendium\nVideo by The Stupendium and Theorist Media\nEdited by Tyler Mascola\nShoot Coordinator: Lizzy CJ\nTrack produced by @OxygenBeats \n\n-----\n\nYou can support The Stupendium on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/thestupendium\n\nGrab your official Stupendium Merchandise!

{"description":"Mat has returned to the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin Texas, and he’s got his hands on the all-new Cybertruck! So of course, you know what that means… It’s drag race time! \n\nNaturally, there was only one competitor that we had to compare this all-electric pick-up to - the Hummer EV! The question is, which will come out on top? \n\nWell, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. \n\nThink that’s heavy? Well, that’s nothing compared to the Hummer, which comes in at 4,110kg!! Just like the Tesla, the Hummer is equipped with three motors, but it’s also up on power, producing 1,014hp and 1,485Nm! The price is also slightly higher than the Cybertruck, coming in at around £109,000.\n\nSo how will this one play out? Will the extra tonne of weight prove decisive? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!","title":"Tesla Cybertruck DRAG RACE","duration":1026,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20231202","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1v0FNR3-Xc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/D1v0FNR3-Xc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3841147}}

{"description":"In this world-exclusive comprehensive First Review of the Tesla Cybertruck, Jason Cammisa tests Tesla’s Cyberbeast — in acceleration, handling, maneuverability, dent-resistance, and safety — and races it down the ¼-mile against the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD and GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup.\n\n==\nThis episode of “Jason Cammisa on the ICONS” is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nFor more info on the Cybertruck, watch Jason's \"Carmudgeon Show\" podcast here: https://youtu.be/NjIPEtegPt4\n\nNo episode of the multiple award-winning series “ICONS” would be complete without a full helping of comedy, two side dishes of crazy action, and a cast of supporting characters. In this case, the latter incudes a 1988 Lamborghini LM002, a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12, a Ford Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV Pickup! \n\nSpecial guest appearances include Hall-of-Fame race-car driver Randy Pobst and \"Engineering Explained\" host Jason Fenske.\n\nCammisa explains the engineering behind Tesla's controversial pickup truck, including its stainless-steel (\"HFS\") exoskeleton construction, enormous aluminum castings and structural battery pack. He attends a live side-impact crash test in Tesla's Crash Lab that demonstrated how tough the skin is. And then, of course, tries to dent it with a sledgehammer. Or BFH, for those who know.\n\nThe similarities with the DeLorean go way beyond the stainless exterior — in fact, the Cybertruck most closely resembles the famed Lamborghini LM002 pickup — a V12-powered dogleg 5-speed off-roader, dubbed \"Rambo Lambo,\" that was as fast as a sports car. In fact, Jason reads an excerpt from the original Car and Driver magazine review of the LM002, and everything said applies directly to the Cybertruck.\n\nIncluding that the Cybertruck Cyberbeast is the quickest-accelerating pickup truck in history. Watch as it leaves the previous champion (the Rivian R1T) for dead, hitting 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and blasting through the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds at 119 mph. Cammisa reran the test on untreated (non-VHT) asphalt and got the same numbers — and marvels at how consistently the Cybertruck accelerated. Even with the Battery SoC in the mid-30-percent range after hours of consecutive runs, it still hit 60 in 2.6 seconds, and had only lost 0.3s at the quarter mile.\n\nThat newfound consistency is partially due to the new 4680 Gen 2 batteries, which are far larger than Tesla's previous 18650 and 2170 batteries, and are manufactured in-house.\n\nThe Cybertruck is nearly twice as efficient as the Hummer EV, thanks to a Lotus-like obsession with efficiency. With a battery pack of just 123 kWh, it's expected to receive an EPA Range of over 310 miles. \n\nAnd the Cybertruck is even lighter than the Rivian R1T, Hummer, and Lightning — Cammisa weighed them all. \n\nCURB WEIGHT:\nCybertruck Cyberbeast  6717 lb\nRivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD 6777 lb\nFord F-150 Lightning 6813 lb\nGMC Hummer EV First Edition 9316 lb\nLamborghini LM002 6499 lb (with 20 gallons of fuel)\n\nOf course, don't miss Randy Pobst in a kart chasing the Cybertruck around Sonoma Raceway's Go-Kart track — or the sight of the LM002 leaning over like it's about to roll down Sonoma's famed Carousel. Or Jason backing into a stainless steel refrigerator because the Cybertruck's rear visibility is so compromised.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Cybertruck Is Real!\n1:18 Why The Cybertruck Looks Like It Does\n2:18 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs Rivian R1T Quad-Motor\n3:50 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs GMC Hummer EV\n4:25 Quickest Pickup In History: 0-60 in 2.6!\n5:20 Tesla's Engineering Efficiency\n6:23 Refrigerator Aerodynamics\n7:35 New 4860 Gen 2 Batteries\n8:11 Tesla's Price Cuts — Vertical Integration\n9:25 Jason Fenske on the Benefits of High Voltage\n10:14 48 Volts!\n11:07 How To Engineer a 48 Volt Vehicle\n11:24 Steer By Wire\n12:06 Turning Radius and Steering Demonstration\n13:07 Cybertruck vs. Go-Kart (maneuverability demo)\n16:02 One Million Pre-Orders\n16:33 Similarities to Delorean DMC-12\n17:44 Sledgehammer Door Ding Test\n18:08 Bulletproof HFS: \"Hard F-ing Steel\"\n18:44 Cybertruck Crash Test\n19:28 Tesla's Safety Record\n20:06 Pedestrian Impact Protection\n20:38 I hate it.

{"description":"This is her Odyssey. #Furiosa - Only in Theaters 2024\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Academy Award-winning mastermind George Miller’s “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” the much-anticipated return to the iconic dystopian world he created more than 30 years ago with the seminal “Mad Max” films.  Miller now turns the page again with an all-new original, standalone action adventure that will reveal the origins of the powerhouse character from the multiple Oscar-winning global smash “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  The new feature from Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures is produced by Miller and his longtime partner, Oscar-nominated producer Doug Mitchell (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Babe”), under their Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner. \n\nAs the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus.  Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.  While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.\n\nTaylor-Joy stars in the title role, and along with Hemsworth, the film also stars Alyla Browne and Tom Burke. \n\nMiller penned the script with “Mad Max: Fury Road” co-writer Nico Lathouris.  Miller’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris, director of photography Simon Duggan (“Hacksaw Ridge,” “The Great Gatsby”), composer Tom Holkenborg, sound designer Robert Mackenzie, editor Eliot Knapman, visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson and colorist Eric Whipp. The team also includes other longtime collaborators: production designer Colin Gibson, editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, each of whom won an Oscar for their work on “Mad Max: Fury Road.” \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, A Kennedy Miller Mitchell Production, A George Miller Film, “Furiosa.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, in theaters only nationwide on May 24, 2024 and internationally beginning on May 22, 2024.","title":"FURIOSA : A MAD MAX SAGA | OFFICIAL TRAILER #1","duration":146,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

The Gigafactory site is littered in Cybertrucks, and Mat will have a chance to walk through the factory to take a look under the skin and find out just how impressive it is. Not only that, he’ll get a chance to sit inside the Cybertruck to take a closer look at the build quality, while also asking other attendees what they make of this ultra-impressive pick-up! \n\n…Oh, and a certain someone called Elon will be in attendance, too.\n\nSo what do you think - will the Cybertruck live up to the hype?!

A natural draft furnace is one where the draft is supplied by convection alone. This is opposed to a forced draft where bellows or fan is used to supply air flow instead. Natural draft furnaces are typically taller than forced draft furnaces to make use of the stack effect. They also often have multiple large air entries or tuyeres to help reduce resistance to air flow. Natural draft furnaces where used to smelt iron in ancient times in Europe and up to more recently in Africa where some are still standing. The lack of the need for bellows reduces labor and complexity.\n\nThe furnace was 1.5 m tall and 25 cm internal diameter with 4 tuyeres 5 cm internal diameter. Charcoal was used as a fuel and iron bacteria was used as an ore. The smelt produced about 4 g of iron prills but could probably be improved with a longer preheat and a higher charcoal to or ratio. A second smelt was run with slag from previous smelts using 8 tuyeres this time to increase air flow.  But it made only about a gram of iron, possibly due to the slag not having much iron left in it. \n\nNatural draft furnaces do not rely on bellows or blowers and so labor is significantly decreased during a smelt. They are also simpler to operate with less components to break down or maintain. However, I've read that they use more charcoal per iron made, possibly because part of the energy from the fuel goes into supplying the air flow through the furnace. With further experimentation, I believe that my natural draft furnaces can make better yields of iron.\n\n\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #Iron Smelt #Draft Furnace","title":"Primitive Technology: Natural Draft Iron Smelt","duration":1329,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20231130","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn9tmm-_yAI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fn9tmm-_yAI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1150478}}

{"description":"What are you afraid of? Watch the new trailer for #NightSwimMovie.\nOnly in theaters January 5.\n\n--------\n\nNo running. No diving. No lifeguard on duty. No swimming after dark. \n\nAtomic Monster and Blumhouse, the producers of M3GAN, high dive into the deep end of horror with the new supernatural thriller, Night Swim. \n\nBased on the acclaimed 2014 short film by Rod Blackhurst and Bryce McGuire, the film stars Wyatt Russell (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) as Ray Waller, a former major league baseball player forced into early retirement by a degenerative illness, who moves into a new home with his concerned wife Eve (Oscar® nominee Kerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin), teenage daughter Izzy (Amélie Hoeferle, this fall’s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes) and young son Elliot (Gavin Warren, Fear the Walking Dead). \n\nSecretly hoping, against the odds, to return to pro ball, Ray persuades Eve that the new home’s shimmering backyard swimming pool will be fun for the kids and provide physical therapy for him. But a dark secret in the home’s past will unleash a malevolent force that will drag the family under, into the depths of inescapable terror. \n\nNight Swim is written and directed by Bryce McGuire (writer of the upcoming film Baghead) and is produced by James Wan, the filmmaker behind the Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring franchises, and Jason Blum, the producer of the Halloween films, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man. The film is executive produced by Michael Clear and Judson Scott for Wan’s Atomic Monster and by Ryan Turek for Blum’s Blumhouse.\n\nWebsite: https://www.nightswim.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nightswimmovie/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nightswimmovie/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics","title":"Night Swim | Official Trailer 2","duration":154,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231129","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhlLO3Nb3sY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PhlLO3Nb3sY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4961181}}

{"description":"How Xi Jinping became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nXi Jinping, president of China and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is one of the most powerful political figures in the world. By initiating an unprecedented third term as China’s leader in October, 2022, Xi has signaled that he may plan to remain in power for life – making him the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong to hold unchecked power over the People’s Republic of China. \n\nBut Xi’s connection to Mao goes deeper than a shared outlook that emphasizes unifying the party around a single leader. When Xi was just a young boy, his family – who had held elite party status thanks to his father’s pivotal role in Mao's “Long March” in 1935 – was denounced during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a chaotic decade of purges and persecution that saw even Mao’s closest allies removed from power. During this time, a teenaged Xi was forced to work hard labor in the countryside outside of Beijing, and his father was imprisoned. \n\nXi’s subsequent rise after Mao died in 1976 was a methodical process in using his restored elite status as leverage to gain prominent party positions in rural provinces around China, culminating in his promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007.\n\nFrom there, Xi pulled from Mao’s playbook: purging his political rivals and promoting those with whom he shared close personal ties. This process undid the work of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, to prevent the consolidation of power around a single leader in China. \n\nBy the time his third term began in October 2022, Xi had reshaped the party and Chinese military leadership to be fully packed with Xi loyalists. And even in the face of social upheaval surrounding his failed Zero Covid policy, Xi has shown no sign of giving up any of the power he has consolidated since taking over as leader of the country. \n\n\nFurther reading: \n\nThese books and podcasts below helped us understand Xi Jinping’s rise, Xi’s similarities to Mao, how politics changed in the PRC since its founding, and the structure and culture of the CCP:\n\nCoalitions of the Weak by Victor Shih (Associate Professor in China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego)\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/coalitions-of-the-weak/6E99B6DB73F934166175D872B51DACD0 \n\nChinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era by Cheng Li (scholar and expert in Chinese elite politics) \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/books/chinese-politics-in-the-xi-jinping-era/ \n\nParty of One by Chun Han Wong (Reporter at the Wall Street Journal) \nhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Party-of-One/Chun-Han-Wong/9781982185732\n\nWealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-first Century by Orville Schell and John Delury \nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/161758/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury/\n\nThe Prince by Sue-Lin Wong (Correspondent at The Economist) \nhttps://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-prince\n\nThese databases and papers were also helpful in gaining a better understanding of Xi Jinping’s alliances and the CCP structure under his terms: \n\nDecoding Chinese Politics interactive by Asia Society Policy Institute \nhttps://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/decoding-chinese-politics\n\nCCP Elite Database by UCSD/Victor Shih\nhttps://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/elites/\n\nChina’s Political System in Charts: A Snapshot Before the 20th Party Congress by Susan V.

And it is not just the US but around the world. People increasingly see themselves as part of opposing teams.\n\nThere are many different reasons for this, but one gets blamed a lot: social media. Social media divides us, makes us more extreme and less empathetic, it riles us up or sucks us into doom scrolling, making us stressed and depressed. It feels like we need to touch grass and escape to the real world. \n\nNew research shows that we might have largely misinterpreted why this is the case. It turns out that the social media internet may uniquely undermine the way our brains work but not in the way you think.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤ https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/47C0nrk\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/46QyCKt\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nrobek, Brad Christensen, Asija Newns, Pedro Castro Verdezoto, Lucas Watkins, damien perolle, Fab Cars, alomanola, MikyF2K, Mithilesh Hinge, okor, Lucan, The Gnome, Kyung Geun Kim, Misa Brass, Martin Hippenstiel, Morgan, Anthony Distel, Filip Rogowski, Gabe, Tobias Hofmann, Zaret, Bootools, David Earl, Ben Hamilton, still [Redacted], polyploidy, Elgenzay, Jared, Soda celeste, Felix, Benjamin Goodrich, Taher Rangwala, Jesse Barnes, WillowTree, DarkKot 686, Aaron Phillips, Luc Royal, Lukas Meier, esamoth, Smithius, Mermor, Laura Kühne, Tyler Fendone, gassi30, Andres Arce, Suzanne frounfelter, Akito Nozaki, SirRender, Space, Daniel Hofmeister, Dan M, Jacob Culp, ReyesX77, Aaron T Haltman, DJ Dubbes, SchnarcheNoah, Keira Standing, Steven Lamontagne, Bliss, David Anderson, Uhh Uhhh Uhhh, The Paul Family","title":"The Internet is Worse Than Ever – Now What?","duration":692,"channel_id":"UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q","author":"Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell","date":"20231129","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuFlMtZmvY0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fuFlMtZmvY0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4619208}}
