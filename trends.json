{"description":"Making mezcal is really hard work. Mexican producers harvest agave by hand and cook it in giant, earthen ovens. Then they crush it using a 1,000-pound, horse-drawn stone and distill it in copper pots. Despite all this effort, Mexican producers aren‚Äôt making the big bucks, even though demand for the spirit is booming.\n\nWhile Mexican regulations do require mezcal to be made in Mexico, that hasn't stopped large, international companies from scooping up mezcal supplies, repackaging, and reselling bottles for huge profits abroad. And the only organization that can stand in the way, the mezcal certifying agency COMERCAM, has faced claims of favoritism of these large companies. This has left some century-old mezcal brands frustrated and fearful that their ancestral ways of making mezcal are at risk. So, there's a growing trend of brands leaving the certified industry and choosing to call their brands \"distilled agave\" instead of mezcal.\n\nMORE BIG BUSINESS VIDEOS: \nHow Junior's Bakes 5 Million Cheesecakes During A Cream Cheese Shortage | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/hktm2mvQKc0\nAirlines Spend Billions, So Why Are Travelers More Miserable Than Ever? | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/MhhJuDap4CU\nQuinoa Prices Crashed.

{"description":"A jury has convicted a Wisconsin man of killing six people and injuring dozens of others when he drove his SUV into a Christmas parade last year. Darrell Brooks was found guilty Wednesday of all 76 charges, including six counts of first-degree intentional homicide. He drove into the parade in Waukesha on Nov. 21 after fleeing a domestic disturbance with an ex-girlfriend. Dozens of other people were hurt. Brooks dismissed his public defenders days before his trial began in early October and defended himself throughout the proceedings. He was removed from the courtroom at times for his erratic outbursts and confrontational exchanges with the judge.\n\nSubscribe to FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClwddNv0Cr6SIEGkzVK886w?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch FOX 9 Live: https://www.fox9.com/live\n\nFOX 9 is your source for breaking news, live events, investigations, politics, entertainment, business news and local stories from Minneapolis-St. Paul, the greater Twin Cities metro, Greater Minnesota, western Wisconsin and across the nation.

{"description":"The 2023 Honda Civic Type R (50,050$ in Canada, $42,895 starting in the US) is the newest rendition of the beloved hot hatchback from Japan. Now with more horsepower and more torque, along with a fresh new look, the new Civic Type R aims to please. 315 horsepower and 310 lb ft of torque are pushed out of a turbo four-cylinder engine, and a limited-slip differential up front helps ensure the power gets put down. Thomas takes the helm for his first drive in the new FL5 generation. Will it be able to live up to the previous generations and be a worthy successor? The bar was already pretty high - let‚Äôs see what the new one can do. We hope you enjoy the episode. Thanks for watching!

It‚Äôs too in character!! Anyway if you haven‚Äôt seen Castlevania, it‚Äôs a Netflix Original animation that‚Äôs (kind of, anyway haha) based off of the Castlevania video game series! I thought it was perrrrrfect to do for Halloween!!! Classic vampires :‚Äô) \nHopefully if you haven‚Äôt seen it, this video should be self-explanatory enough! I based it off of Season 2 (season 1 only has 4 episodes) - so you won‚Äôt get too many major spoilers, just setting up some stuff Carmilla wants to do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Listen I just really wanted an excuse to put up my Dracula portrait in the background (-: (BUT ITS BLURRED ANYWAY SO YOU CAN‚ÄôT EVEN SEE IT ARGH)\n\nALSO the video is so zoomed in; check out my instagram to see the whole dress!!

I know there are some Castlevania fans lurking in my community! :) \n\nPS - Carmilla is literally so evil, like just a very very bad person (vampire) - I tried to show off her more manipulative side in this video hehehehe. But she does touch your face and stuff WITHOUT ASKING..!!!! !!  but that‚Äôs it; shouldn‚Äôt be anything else bad in this video! \n\nHmmm what else!?\n-IM MAD ABOUT MY WIG, IF YOU NOTICE IT, NO YOU DIDN‚ÄôT \n-Also my accent.....
