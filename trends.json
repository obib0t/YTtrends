Head coach Thomas Tuchel started with a strong line-up of Sven Ulreich in goal, a back four of Noussair Mazraoui, Dayot Upamecano, Benjamin Pavard and Alphonso Davies. Konrad Laimer was handed his debut in midfield alongside captain Joshua Kimmich. The front four consisted of Leroy Sane, Jamal Musiala, Mathys Tel and Serge Gnabry.

How did the US go from having luxurious, widely used passenger trains to the Amtrak system we have today? \n\nVideo producer Dean Peterson makes a 72-hour journey on Amtrak from LA to NYC to show its current state of operation. From getting kicked in the head by his sleeping seat mate to taking in sweeping views of the desert at sunset, Dean shows the highs and lows of being stuck on Amtrak for days on end. \n\nAlong the way, he explains the history of passenger rail in the US ‚Äî starting in the problematic robber baron era to the US government‚Äôs takeover of passenger rail. Will the United States ever catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to train travel, or are Americans stuck with an underfunded, inefficient rail network forever?

{"description":"Mike, Jay, and Rich Evans have returned again to the black void. Their reason today? To talk about a new huge summer blockbuster movie? No. Quite the opposite. They was gonna talk about Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 2: Dead Reckoning 1, BUT they thought‚Ä¶ how many times can one see Tom Cruise do stints? No, this day Mike, Jay, and Rich have returned to the black void to talk about ‚ÄúWatchbait‚Äù the movie version of ‚ÄúClickbait‚Äù. Trash that has overrun a once great institution like Tubi. And before you ask, no we wasn‚Äôt compensated by Tubi to promote these films. We were just browsing about and saw a trend. A trend of using certain words or phrases in a title to get one to click on their junk film to watch it, only to realize after a few minutes they made the worst mistake of their lives. This particular video wasn‚Äôt a Half in the Bag. Nor was it a re:View. Nor was it a Best of the Worst. I guess it could have been a ‚ÄúTalks About‚Äù video, but nah. We made a new show called ‚ÄúBeyond the Black Void‚Äù and if you ever see one of these again, it‚Äôs just Mike, Jay and Rich Evens talking about something of interest. In solidarity with the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strike we decided to talk about movies that in no way whatsoever could have possibly been made under any conceivable union agreement. In fact, I‚Äôd be shocked if one of these pictures weren‚Äôt some kind of nudie snuff film. Maybe that‚Äôs why Jay ‚Äúdownloaded all of them on his dark web server‚Äù whatever that means. And yes, it‚Äôs 100% true, we did just spring this whole thing on Rich Evans. I rang him up on my landline to tell him to come to the studio. Well, actually I left a message on his answering machine. He showed up coming from the gym where‚Äôs he‚Äôs done many power squats and asked me ‚ÄúWhat we shootin‚Äô Mike?‚Äù and I tell him to sit down and shut up you shit-for-brains. He sits down, but there is an immediate squish sound. It would appear that Rich had soiled his large diaper. He claimed he didn‚Äôt know. He insisted he ONLY wears a diaper when he does power squats at the gym. 1. it helps stifle the sound of any accidental fart release, but also for‚Ä¶ you know what. An accidental Hershey squirt.

In this video, we'll explore and uncover why so few Americans live in what I've termed the \"Empty West.\"\n\nStock footage is acquired from www.storyblocks.com.\n\nSome videos provided by E James Merl on Pexels.\n\nAnimation support provided by DH Designs (needahittman.com)","title":"Why So Few Americans Live In This HUGE Area Of The West Coast","duration":700,"channel_id":"UC7-Z34pbJ0ZAOJRmUCEz0Cg","author":"Geography By Geoff","date":"20230717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOoFsehit6U","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cOoFsehit6U/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1089939}}

While dad Mack is content to keep his family safe paddling around their New England pond forever, mom Pam is eager to shake things up and show their kids‚Äîteen son Dax and duckling daughter Gwen‚Äîthe whole wide world. After a migrating duck family alights on their pond with thrilling tales of far-flung places, Pam persuades Mack to embark on a family trip, via New York City, to tropical Jamaica. \n\nAs the Mallards make their way South for the winter, their well-laid plans quickly go awry. The experience will inspire them to expand their horizons, open themselves up to new friends and accomplish more than they ever thought possible, while teaching them more about each other‚Äîand themselves‚Äîthan they ever imagined. \n\nFrom a screenplay by Mike White, the Emmy winning creator of The White Lotus and the screenwriter of School of Rock, the film stars a top-flight comedic cast led by Oscar¬Æ and Emmy nominee Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick, Eternals) as anxious Mallard dad Mack and Emmy nominee Elizabeth Banks (Hunger Games and Pitch Perfect franchises) as Pam, the Mallards‚Äô daring, quick-witted matriarch.\n\nCaspar Jennings plays Dax, the Mallards‚Äô confident and restless son, and, in her feature film debut, Tresi Gazal plays Gwen, the family‚Äôs innocent and lovable daughter.\n\nGolden Globe winner Awkwafina (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) voices the scrappy leader of a New York City pigeon gang; Emmy winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Carol Kane (The Princess Bride) plays Erin the heron, the first friend that the Mallards make on their journey; Emmy winner Keegan-Michael Key (The Super Mario Bros. Movie, The Lion King) voices a homesick Jamaican parrot locked away in a Manhattan restaurant, and BAFTA winner David Mitchell (Peep Show) plays the yogic leader of a mysterious duck farm. Legendary Emmy winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Danny DeVito (It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia) co-stars as Mack‚Äôs curmudgeonly, adventure-averse Uncle Dan. \n\nDirected by Benjamin Renner, the Oscar¬Æ-nominated filmmaker of Ernest & Celestine and The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales, Migration is a visual spectacle unlike any in Illumination‚Äôs acclaimed history, featuring elevated, expressionist artistry and Illumination‚Äôs signature subversive humor and authentic heart, unforgettable characters and joyful soundtrack. \n\nProduced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri, Migration is a film about overcoming your fears and opening yourself up to the world and its opportunities. The film is co-directed by Guylo Homsy (Head of Layout and Cinematography for Sing and Sing 2), edited by Christian Gazal (Happy Feet, Peter Rabbit) and the Production Designer is Colin Stimpson (The Secret Life of Pets 2).","title":"Migration | Official Trailer","duration":192,"channel_id":"UCq7OHvWO6Z3u-LztFdrcU-g","author":"Illumination","date":"20230718","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQfo0HJhCnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cQfo0HJhCnE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":6650046}}

Often described as \"a show about nothing,\" Seinfeld mines the humor in life's mundane situations like waiting in line, searching for a lost item, or the trials and tribulations of dating. Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry's ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry's neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry's eccentric neighbor, Kramer.\n\n#Seinfeld #LarryDavid #TheBeard\n\nGeorge's Toup√©e Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeld\nhttps://bit.ly/OfficialSeinfeld","title":"George's Toup√©e Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeld","duration":310,"channel_id":"UCKv01ZGOJhp2HbtDe4EvS8A","author":"Seinfeld","date":"20230717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVBbqvLtWBs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVBbqvLtWBs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":552237}}

The arcades include highly detailed machines with realistic physics that are inspired by modern arcade machines. There are ticket redemption areas to exchange your counted tickets for all kinds of fun prizes. Larry's Arcade has an in-house animatronic band called Teddy and the Ticket Eaters that would love to play you some tunes while you enjoy the arcade. The most recent addition to Islandville island, UFO Arcade features modern space inspired arcade machines, Lazer Tag and an Indoor Go Kart Race Track. Make sure to watch out for the minions, they really love Teddy and his band and they also are pretty good at Lazer Tag. Run out of money? That's ok. You can work odd jobs around the island to get back on your feet. Got extra prizes? The island has a Pawn Shop that will buy your used prizes for cash so you can go blow it back at the arcade.\n\nThe Coin Game also features a full fledged Traveling Carnival with over 20 classic games, rides and machines to choose from. The carnival also brings new prizes to win, hoard or sell for cash at Barrys pawn shop. The rides are all interactive and are overpriced just like in real life... so you better be winning, working or begging Uncle Phil for more spending cash if you want to enjoy them. (Birthday mode is unlimited money for all you lazies out there that just want to live off of Uncle Phils wallet and have a good time. So dont worry he has you covered). But dont get comfy as Survivor Mode is still being developed. ;)\n\nYou can play The Coin Game anyway that you like. For the laid back players, you can just play the fun games and win tickets to exchange for silly prizes. You don't have to worry about anything but winning tickets. Unlimited money. No curfews. No rules.... just arcade freedom brought to you by your rich Uncle Phil.\n\nThe Coin Game includes all the fun activities of a real trip to the arcade. Including drinking soda all day, dodging sugar filled minions and living off of vending machine cheesy poofs. To earn a little extra money you can scavenge the dumpsters and trash cans or even deliver newspapers around the island for extra spending loot. Explore the island on the Islandville bus system or even your very own golf cart.\n\nThere is lots of highway traffic and tourist activity on the island all year round, so make sure to keep off the roads or you may get a little surprise. There is even a few areas planned for the future that are off limits for now and surrounded by construction fencing to keep you safe. The Islandville Transit bus is always running if you need to get around the island doing chores. To hail the bus, simply click the button in any bus stop and buy a bus pass. Each bus ride costs one pass ($1.50).\n\nWith over 40 different games and machines there is already plenty to do on the island. You can play The Coin Game with any mouse, keyboard or any Dual stick/pad controller. The game includes a easy to use key mapping system to support virtually any controller or peripheral. So you can play The Coin Game any way that you like.\n\nThe Coin Game is developed by a one man indie developer over the last 3 years with the wonderful support of his wife, family and 2 weiner dogs.","title":"I Turned This Entire Game Into a Glitchy Pain Paradise - The Coin Game","duration":1320,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20230715","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NxW3xSAqUg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6NxW3xSAqUg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1804302}}

{"description":"Rory McIlroy produced a brilliant birdie-birdie finish to break home hearts and seal his second consecutive Rolex Series title at the Genesis Scottish Open.\n\n‚ñ∫ SUBSCRIBE: http://et.golf/Subscribe \r\n\r\nThe DP World Tour and PGA TOUR host the world's best for a second year at The Renaissance Club for the Genesis Scottish Open. The Field is full of golf's elite with Jon Rahm the only one in the top-10 choosing to miss this week before the year‚Äôs final major. World No.1 Scottie Scheffler will be teeing it up in Scotland this week.

Tied 12th on debut here in 2021 and finishing in the top-10 in the first three majors of the year, he‚Äôll almost certainly be amongst it come Sunday. Rory McIlroy returns for his eighth appearance at Scotland's national open.

Xander Schauffele returns to defend his Genesis Scottish Open title. He‚Äôll feel optimistic of his chances this week after hitting a bogey-free 62 to equal the lowest round at a Major at last months US Open. He‚Äôs also claimed top-20 finishes in each of his last nine starts. Viktor Hovland, Max Homa, Jordan Spieth and Tommy Fleetwood will all be shooting for top spot in Scotland.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Official YouTube channel of the DP World Tour.

{"description":"Post Malone - Overdrive (Official Live Performance)\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast ‚Äì and it‚Äôs always been that way. Listen to ‚ÄúWhite Iverson‚Äù again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‚Äòbeerbongs & bentleys‚Äô and ‚ÄòTwelve Carat Toothache‚Äô and you‚Äôll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we‚Äôre waiting for ‚ÄòAustin,‚Äô Posty‚Äôs latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsome of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least ‚Äì trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.‚Äù To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he‚Äôs leveling up once again, no doubt. Check this performance of ‚ÄúOverdrive,‚Äù one of the 17 songs from the new album, and stay close as we roll out more performances soon.\n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.
