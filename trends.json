The Three-Way Knockouts are also back. This time, however, artists will select their own songs to perform.\n\nOnce the Live Performance Shows begin, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast. This time, the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists. In the end, one artist will be named \"The Voice\" and receive the grand prize of a recording contract.\n \nAnd the Winner of The Voice Is... | The Voice Live Finale | NBC\nhttps://youtu.be/k1b4XATiAIA\n\nThe Voice\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","title":"And the Winner of The Voice Is... | The Voice Live Finale | NBC","duration":546,"channel_id":"UCpdK1NLHxEUGXc1gq2NxkTw","author":"The Voice","date":"20231220","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1b4XATiAIA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k1b4XATiAIA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":492241}}

{"description":"Bobby Carter | December 18, 2023\nScarface's Tiny Desk concert radiates with his decadeslong passion as an emcee and producer. There's calculated intent behind every word and note of this 30-minute set and I learned that his love for golf also runs deep during our initial meeting. He was playing a round and had difficulty dividing his attention between the plan and the course. Three days before the show, amid rehearsals, I got a call from Facemob asking, \"What if I brought Mike Dean?\" My expectations were already high, but that final addition set the stage for something special.\n\nMike Dean provided unmatched authenticity, and their shared stories added sentimental value to this performance. After all, his signature keys and synths can be heard on most of Scarface's classics and countless Rap-A-Lot records. Here, we get a rare glimpse of Scarface the conductor, bouncing through multiple eras of his catalog including \"On My Block,\" \"Mary Jane\" and the bone-chilling \"I Seen a Man Die.\"\n\nScarface, along with Rakim, was recently awarded the inaugural Hip-Hop Grandmaster Award from the newly launched Paid in Full Foundation, which includes a sizable financial prize and healthcare. No matter how the never-ending hip-hop greats debate is sliced, the rapper's place is cemented as one of the most influential storytellers in the culture and his Tiny Desk is proof.\n\nSET LIST\n\"On My Block\"\n\"Mary Jane\"\n\"Smile\"\n\"I Seen a Man Die\"\n\"F**k Faces\"\n\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nScarface: lead vocals, guitar\nMike Dean: keys\nSteven \"Spud\" Howard: vocals\nTakai \"Cookie\" Hicks: vocals \nPeigh Jones: vocals, guitar \nCorey \"FunkaFingers\" Stoot: guitar \nJosh Henderson: keys\nJason \"The Bishop\" Allen: keys\nSavar Martin: drums \nAnthony \"Antboogie\" Nicholson: bass, musical direction \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Maia Stern\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Alant√© Serene, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Ted Mebane\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Kara Frame, Hazel Cills\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #scarface","title":"Scarface: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1887,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20231218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajNYTJcF6rE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ajNYTJcF6rE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1342167}}

{"description":"Get tickets now: https://www.thechosenriseup.com/\n\n\"Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" That was the theme of Season 3. Jesus said this to a crowd of thousands before also saying it to Simon while they stood on water. Season 4? Jesus is weary and heavy-laden, and He needs rest.\n\nWe're getting closer and closer to Jerusalem, to what we know is coming. Jesus is getting increasingly frustrated, and yes, sad. Not because he's getting closer to death, but because of the reasons He must die. From his faith's religious leaders, to the holy city of Jerusalem, to his own friends and followers, people are not understanding his mission. To that end, He must allow painful things, and even set in motion certain confusing or bittersweet events, to accelerate the outcomes that will lead to Holy Week. \n\nSeason 4 marks the midpoint of the most famous and influential story in human history. It will be painful, and it will be joyous. It will be bittersweet. But by all measures, Season 4 will also be our best.\n\n- Dallas Jenkins, Creator of The Chosen","title":"The Chosen: Season 4 Official Trailer","duration":150,"channel_id":"UCBXOFnNTULFaAnj24PAeblg","author":"The Chosen","date":"20231218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wisX-CEjoxc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/wisX-CEjoxc/hqdefault.webp?v=657c826e","content":{"View count":1091034}}

Sadot's Super News üéÆüí•\"\n\nüåå Durag Nation, brace yourselves for a major update on the Insomniac Games hack, arguably the worst leak in gaming history. Skip the intros - we're diving straight into this critical situation. If you value this kind of urgent gaming news, smash that like button or hit dislike as you see fit. Let's get into it. üéÆüîî\n\nüîπ 'Insomniac Games Under Siege': First, a shoutout to the team at Insomniac, who are facing a tough time with both their hard work being compromised and personal employee information leaked. This isn't just about the games; it's about real people behind them whose lives are at risk. üö®üë•\n\nüîπ 'Massive Scale of the Leak': The hackers demanded a ransom and even hosted an auction for the stolen data. After a week, they released most of what they had - over 1 million files, totaling 1.6 terabytes. This includes everything from employee passports to the licensing agreement between Marvel Games and Insomniac. üìõüìÇ\n\nüîπ 'Targeted Attack on Insomniac and Sony': The hackers' intention was purely monetary, choosing Insomniac and Sony as they believed gaming companies would be easy targets. They accessed the network in under 30 minutes, and the fallout is catastrophic. üí∞üïπÔ∏è\n\nüîπ 'Impact on Insomniac‚Äôs Future Plans': Every plan Insomniac had for the next decade is now exposed, including budgets, release years, and identities of upcoming games. 'Marvel‚Äôs Wolverine' has been particularly hit hard, with gameplay, cutscenes, and the entire story leaked. üåêüéÆ\n\nüîπ 'Comparisons to GTA 6 Leak': While GTA 6 suffered a leak of early test footage, the scale of Insomniac's breach is unparalleled.

{"description":"Olivia Rodrigo - pretty isn‚Äôt pretty | Vevo Official Live Performance \n\nOnly superlatives come to mind when trying to sum up Olivia Rodrigo‚Äôs last few years. Her impactful debut ballad ‚Äòdrivers license‚Äô goes hand in hand with words such as ‚Äúmost‚Äù and ‚Äúbest‚Äù: most streams on Spotify in a single day and week, Top 100 most-streamed songs on the platform, the Best Pop Solo Performance award at that year‚Äôs GRAMMYs. That the teen sensation could follow the ‚Äúdrivers license‚Äù craze with ‚Äúgood 4 u,‚Äù ‚Äúdeja vu,‚Äù and ultimately her debut album ‚ÄòSOUR‚Äô - all now equally beloved - was the first sign that the pop world had a rarified capital S Superstar on its hands. You can forget about that dreaded sophomore slump, too. Thanks in part to her trusty producer sidekick Dan Nigro, ‚ÄòGUTS‚Äô elevates all the ingredients that really popped in ‚ÄôSOUR,‚Äô the 90s slacker rock guitar arrangements and riffs, the theater-kid earnestness, the talkative asides. There‚Äôs one key thematic difference. ‚ÄúLots of the new songs are about growing up rather than breakups,‚Äù Olivia proudly stated recently. When we linked up with her at LA's Million Dollar Theater, not only had her wattage grown brighter, her command of the stage and camera were somehow even stronger than before. Speaking of growing up, \"pretty isn't pretty\" takes aim the not-so-nice social pressures one faces as the spotlight grows brighter, especially women. Another gut punch delivered on a platter of angsty pop-rock perfection. \n\nListen to GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS\nShop GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/store\n\nFollow Olivia Rodrigo:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oliviarodrigo\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oliviarodrigo\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OliviaRodrigoOfficial\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@livbedumb\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/livieshq\n\nVevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\nDirector: Skyler Brown\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nDirector, Line Production: Yanina Molina\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nLine Producer, Contrast Films: Cole Brian\nSenior Producer, Editorial: Ronni Leverich\nAssociate Producer: Lola Gatti\nAssociate Producer, Contrast Films: Sacha Noelle\nDirector of Photography: Tehillah De Castro\nProduction Designer: Helen Morales\nHead of Design: Sydney Emery\nDirector of Post Production: Michael Coleman\nProject Manager: Dominic Siri\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nDirector, Talent: Gabby Prisciandaro\nHead of Artist/Label Relations & Digital Marketing: David McTiernan\n\nHayley Brownell ‚Äì Drums\nCamila Mora - Keys\nMoa Munoz ‚Äì Bass\nEmily Rosenfield ‚Äì Guitar\nDaisy Spencer ‚Äì Guitar\n \nAleen Keshishian - Lighthouse Management + Media\nZack Morgenroth - Lighthouse Management + Media\nJames Thompson - Lighthouse Management + Media\n \nStacy Jones ‚Äì Musical Director\nMax Mitchell ‚Äì Musical Director\nValerie Morehouse-wilde ‚Äì Vocal Coach\nMelissa Garcia ‚Äì Movement\n \nMarty Hom ‚Äì Tour Director \nBret Chin-quan ‚Äì Tour / Production Manager\nElisa Gonzalez ‚Äì Production Coordinator\nBrian Pomp ‚Äì Audio Engineer\nSeamus Fenton ‚Äì Audio Engineer\nPaul Hager ‚Äì Broadcast Mixer\nCraig Frank ‚Äì Playback \nLuis Munoz ‚Äì Backline Tech\nRyan Gore ‚Äì Backline Tech\nMaurizio ‚Äì Backline Tech\nChristian Pagliarulo - Runner\n \n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Cole Ewing\n1st AC: Michael Lemnitze\n2nd AC: Jenny Roh\nLoader: Chastin Noblett\n\nA1: Casey Graham\nA2: Maja Sazdic\n\nGaffer: Jihan \"Jay\" Casquejo\nBest Boy Electric: Peter Murphy\nSLT/Driver: Paul Kane\nSLT: Ben Bowen\nSLT: Mauricio Aguilar\nSLT: Diego Castellanos\nKey Grip: Kyle Sorvig\nBest Boy Grip: Connor Colby \nGrip: Hannah Rydberg\nGrip: Matt Seest\nGrip: Mason McLaury\nGrip: Nick Zajic\n\nGrip: Jacob Senn\nLCP: Ryan Jacob Morgan\n\nArt Director: Nicholas Kerr\nSet Decorator: Katie Balun\nLead Person: Ian Buckley \nArt Department Coordinator: Matthew Toth\nSet Dresser: Christopher \"Drew\" Wall\nSet Dresser: Jonathan \"Jrod\" Rodriguez\nSet Dresser: Jessen T.

{"description":"The crew is back at @midamericaoutdoors for Travis Pastrana's final progression session along side Banks Hovey. As Travis awaits a full knee replacement in the coming days, he has decided to check one last item off his bucket list. Travis' goal is to back flip onto an elevated platform, do a nose bonk, then front flip out of the nose bonk back to his wheels. Banks plans to jump onto the platform, wheelie across, and backflip off. Both of these tricks have never been attempted, so come along for the ride as Nate Wessel and Hubert Rowland help Travis and Banks work through multiple ramp variations, distance measurements, platform angles, and injuries in an attempt to reach their goals.\n\nFollow Us:\nChannel 199 IG: https://www.instagram.com/channel199_/\nTravis IG: https://www.instagram.com/travispastrana/\nBRCC IG: https://www.instagram.com/blackriflecoffee/\nBRCC Motorsports IG: https://www.instagram.com/brcc_motorsports/\n\nShop Travis/BRCC: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/pages/travis-pastrana","title":"PASTRANA‚ÄôS FINAL SEND","duration":1006,"channel_id":"UCeikp7aPCip7YW9tCA3ilBg","author":"Channel 199","date":"20231217","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlv50fh7m_4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qlv50fh7m_4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1705086}}

{"description":"Paddy Pimblett's triumph over Tony Ferguson at UFC 296 unfolded as a captivating 15-minute spectacle, culminating in a decisive unanimous decision victory. Despite initial aspirations for an early finish, Pimblett's performance demonstrated a profound level of control and skill throughout the bout, leaving an indelible mark on the T-Mobile Arena. #UFC296 #tonyferguson #paddypimblett \n\nHailing from Liverpool, Pimblett showcased his striking prowess in the first round, where Ferguson resiliently weathered a barrage of attacks. The relentless pressure applied by Pimblett eventually resulted in a dramatic knockdown, prompting an eager pursuit of a finish on the canvas. Despite Ferguson's tenacious defensive maneuvers, Pimblett maintained unwavering control, showcasing a masterful display of ground-and-pound expertise.\n\nAs the fight progressed, Pimblett continued to assert his dominance on the ground, effectively fending off Ferguson's attempts from the bottom. Even as signs of fatigue surfaced in the third round, Pimblett executed yet another well-timed takedown, securing the win with a calculated flurry of punches.\n\nWith all three judges unanimously scoring the contest 30-27 in favor of Pimblett, he celebrated the hard-earned victory while acknowledging Ferguson's undeniable toughness. The match not only highlighted Pimblett's growth as he moved to an impressive 21-3 in his career but also raised questions about Ferguson's future in the sport as he faced his seventh consecutive defeat.\n\nClick here to Subscribe to our YouTube channel http://bit.ly/2quZwsz\n\nFollow My Twitter https://twitter.com/Keanutalksmma\n\nClick here to like our Facebook page \nhttps://bit.ly/2ZmykdU\n\nWatch our most recent video!\n\nThe electrifying atmosphere at T-Mobile Arena, characterized by the contrasting walkout songs and a divided crowd, added an extra layer of intensity to the lightweight bout.

Meanwhile, Ferguson's struggles, despite his collaboration with fitness motivator David Goggins, raised further speculation about the trajectory of his career.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bout, Pimblett's victory stood as a testament to his evolving skill set and strategic prowess.

Now all we need is some sails and we are ready to get wet.¬†¬†\n\nPlus, we reveal the completed installation of what has no doubt been the most debated piece of equipment of this entire boat building saga.\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I think building a new boat would be this much work.¬† And we‚Äôre not even the ones doing the labor.¬†\n\nOur days and nights are filled to the brim with decisions to be made, parts to be purchased and logistics to be planned (oh how I have NOT missed maritime bureaucracy).¬† The closer handover day gets, the more complicated the logistics seem to get.¬† Boat insurance for SE Asia looks expensive and potentially difficult to obtain.¬† We‚Äôre still searching for the port of least resistance to check into the Philippines and sailing out of China, well that is a whole other kettle of fish.¬†\n\nSo many adventures ahead with so many variables to plan for.¬† We have gained a boat load of knowledge over the past 2 years (much more than expected) and we still have soooo much more to learn.¬† We are fortunate HH Catamarans has been so open to letting us roam free in the yard, film without abandon and ask 1001 questions.¬†\n\nThank you so much for being a part of this untethered journey with us. ¬†It‚Äôs been a rollercoaster of a year, and I don‚Äôt expect 2024 will be anything less.¬† So, rest up, have the most wonderful holiday break and we will see you in the new year!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWE‚ÄôRE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe‚Äôve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we‚Äôre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Building a New Catamaran\n01:47 Buying a Dishwasher for a Sailboat\n04:09 Dishwasher Install on a Catamaran\n08:05 Our Electric Jet Tender\n11:14 Sea Trials of the ZeroJet OC Tender\n17:35 Incredible Chinese Seafood Restaurant \n19:55 China Package Delivery\n20:41 Installing the Mast on a Sailboat\n23:14 Interior and Cushion Designs\n24:35 Good End to an Untethered Year\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n¬© Gone With the Wynns 2023","title":"Biggest Argument Settled!

Thanks again to thredUP for sponsoring :)\n\nA Definitive Ranking of 2023 Pop Culture Moments\n\nmy new years resolution is to stop bringing up snap snap \n\nI can't believe it's already time for this video! This time last year we definitively ranked pop culture and meme moments from 2022 and I had a few of you ask for a 2023 version so here we are. Also thanks to everyone who has been sending stuff in over the past few weeks, really appreciate it :))  also x2 sorry if i sound quieter than usual i had the flu when i was recording this go easy on meeee thank u LOL and final also... (sorry) you prob noticed i had to try a different set up for filming this one, because this was a longer list and the tier size was going to change a lot i realized the easiest way to keep as much of it in view as possible was to ditch the green screen for this one so hope you dont mind!!!  \n\nOk SO after consulting you guys (and myself lol) i widdled down all the pop culture moments and memes that happened this year whether they were tik tok trends, twitter moments, celebrity pop culture stuff or other noteworthy events for us to rank today! We're talking the Josh Hutcherson whistle meme, Harry Styles going bald, Taylor Swift enjoying seemingly... ranch? The Pedro Pascal renaissance on Tiktok,  the \"girly teen girl\" twitter debate, Lana Del Rey working at waffle house and tons of other stuff too. \n\nLike I mentioned in the video this list isn't exhaustive, because my tier names are the way they are there are some things that just flat out do not make sense to rank within it lol so hope that's understandable! As always with these videos though while the ranking is definitive for me it doesn't have to be for you! Feel free to share your ranking in the comments i love seeing them :)) ALSO IF ANY OF YALL HAVE SEEN THOSE MONKEYS ON TIKTOK PLEEEEEEASE TELL ME I FEEL LIKE IM GOING CRAZY NONE OF MY IRLS HAVE SEEN THEM LMAO \n\nAnd ofc!!! hope you guys have a good holiday!! This time of the year can get super hectic and stressful so hope you're taking care of yourself. this past year on the internet has been so fun with yall and i seriously cant thank u enough for it i feel like a cornball when i try to explain it but i hope you know i feel really lucky and happy to have you guys, see you in the new year :) \n\nok i'll wrap it up lol if you liked the video feel free to give it like and subscribe to the channel it really helps me out :) you can also turn on my post notifications if you want to be notified every time I upload but otherwise, hope you guys enjoy and I'll see you in the comments!!\n\n//Other videos you might like\n\nExploring the World of ‚ÄúJobless‚Äù Celebrities\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Pk9ecXYHY\n\nExploring the Insane World of Colleen Hoover (Part 1)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IatKojHB5KE \n\nExploring the World's Messiest Pop Star: Justin Bieber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpmaMz3ilbE\n\nExploring 2013 Pop Culture...

{"description":"Olivia Rodrigo - get him back! | Vevo Official Live Performance\n\nOnly superlatives come to mind when trying to sum up Olivia Rodrigo‚Äôs last few years. Her incredibly impactful debut ballad ‚Äòdrivers license‚Äô goes hand in hand with words such as ‚Äúmost‚Äù and ‚Äúbest‚Äù: most streams on Spotify in a single day and week, Top 100 most-streamed songs on the platform, the Best Pop Solo Performance award at that year‚Äôs GRAMMYs. That the teen sensation could follow the ‚Äúdrivers license‚Äù craze with ‚Äúgood 4 u,‚Äù ‚Äúdeja vu,‚Äù and ultimately her debut album ‚ÄòSOUR‚Äô - all now equally beloved - was the first sign that the pop world had a rarified capital S Superstar on its hands. You can forget about that dreaded sophomore slump too. Thanks in part to her trusty producer sidekick Dan Nigro, ‚ÄòGUTS‚Äô elevates all the ingredients that really popped in ‚ÄôSOUR,‚Äô the 90s slacker rock guitar arrangements and riffs, the theater-kid earnestness, the talkative asides. There‚Äôs one key thematic difference. ‚ÄúLots of the new songs are about growing up rather than breakups,‚Äù Olivia proudly stated recently. When we linked up with her at the Million Dollar Theater in LA, not only had her wattage grown brighter, her command of the stage and camera were somehow even stronger than before. The chosen acoustic slant of ‚Äúget him back!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take away from its puckish edge. In fact, it feels like you‚Äôve crashed the band's rehearsal sesh, where you‚Äôre happily stomping and clapping along in the corner while they make a some magic. \n\nListen to ‚Äúget him back!‚Äù on GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS\n\nShop GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/store\n\nFollow Olivia Rodrigo:\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/oliviarodrigo/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oliviarodrigo\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OliviaRodrigoOfficial/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@livbedumb\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/livieshq\n\nVevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\nDirector: Skyler Brown\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nDirector, Line Production: Yanina Molina\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nLine Producer, Contrast Films: Cole Brian\nSenior Producer, Editorial: Ronni Leverich\nAssociate Producer: Lola Gatti\nAssociate Producer, Contrast Films: Sacha Noelle\nDirector of Photography: Tehillah De Castro\nProduction Designer: Helen Morales\nHead of Design: Sydney Emery\nDirector of Post Production: Michael Coleman\nProject Manager: Dominic Siri\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nDirector, Talent: Gabby Prisciandaro\nHead of Artist/Label Relations & Digital Marketing: David McTiernan\n\nHayley Brownell ‚Äì Drums\nCamila Mora - Keys\nMoa Munoz ‚Äì Bass\nEmily Rosenfield ‚Äì Guitar\nDaisy Spencer ‚Äì Guitar\n \nAleen Keshishian - Lighthouse Management + Media\nZack Morgenroth - Lighthouse Management + Media\nJames Thompson - Lighthouse Management + Media\n \nStacy Jones ‚Äì Musical Director\nMax Mitchell ‚Äì Musical Director\nValerie Morehouse-wilde ‚Äì Vocal Coach\nMelissa Garcia ‚Äì Movement\n \nMarty Hom ‚Äì Tour Director \nBret Chin-quan ‚Äì Tour / Production Manager\nElisa Gonzalez ‚Äì Production Coordinator\nBrian Pomp ‚Äì Audio Engineer\nSeamus Fenton ‚Äì Audio Engineer\nPaul Hager ‚Äì Broadcast Mixer\nCraig Frank ‚Äì Playback \nLuis Munoz ‚Äì Backline Tech\nRyan Gore ‚Äì Backline Tech\nMaurizio ‚Äì Backline Tech\nChristian Pagliarulo - Runner\n \n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Cole Ewing\n1st AC: Michael Lemnitze\n2nd AC: Jenny Roh\nLoader: Chastin Noblett\n\nA1: Casey Graham\nA2: Maja Sazdic\n\nGaffer: Jihan \"Jay\" Casquejo\nBest Boy Electric: Peter Murphy\nSLT/Driver: Paul Kane\nSLT: Ben Bowen\nSLT: Mauricio Aguilar\nSLT: Diego Castellanos\nKey Grip: Kyle Sorvig\nBest Boy Grip: Connor Colby \nGrip: Hannah Rydberg\nGrip: Matt Seest\nGrip: Mason McLaury\nGrip: Nick Zajic\n\nGrip: Jacob Senn\nLCP: Ryan Jacob Morgan\n\nArt Director: Nicholas Kerr\nSet Decorator: Katie Balun\nLead Person: Ian Buckley \nArt Department Coordinator: Matthew Toth\nSet Dresser: Christopher \"Drew\" Wall\nSet Dresser: Jonathan \"Jrod\" Rodriguez\nSet Dresser: Jessen T.

{"description":"In the opening round of the 2023 PNC Championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods carded a combined 8-under 64.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PNC Championship is held for the 26th time this week as the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hosts 20 two-player teams featuring a PGA TOUR, Champions Tour or LPGA player and one of their family members. After Tiger Woods made his return to action at the Hero World Challenge for the first time since withdrawing at the Masters, he‚Äôll once again be back to tee it up at the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie. The duo was tied for second a year ago after the first round, but stalled on Sunday and ended up tied for eighth. Justin Thomas returns this year to play alongside his father, Mike.  Justin Thomas finished third at the Hero World Challenge two weeks ago and will be feeling confident about taking his second PNC Championship title, as the Thomases won here in 2020. Defending champions Vijay Singh and his son Qass are looking to recreate their magic from 2022. Last year was their 16th time teeing it up together at this event, and they finally broke through for a win, becoming the first pair to shoot two sub-60 rounds at the event. Other pairings to look out for are Nelly Korda and her father Petr, Matt Kuchar and his elder son Cameron, and Bernhard Langer and his son Jason.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Tiger and Charlie Woods shoot 8-under 64 | Round 1 | PNC Championship | 2023","duration":492,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20231216","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXHgVesf1xE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cXHgVesf1xE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":735961}}
