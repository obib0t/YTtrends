{"description":"Aaron Rodgers left last night’s loss to the Philadelphia Eagles with a rib injury. Despite appearing to be in pain while on the field, Rodgers said that he is not ruling out next week against the Bears if he checks out fine this week. He is scheduled for X-Rays today. Jordan Love came in relief of Rodgers and immediately led the Green Bay Packers on a scoring drive. Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe talk Packers.\n\n#Undisputed #NFL #Packers\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n► Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n▶ First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n▶ The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n► SPEAK's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n► FOX Bet Live’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n► Club Shay Shay’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n► The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n▶ Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE\n► What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n▶ The Carton Show’s YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\nFollow UNDISPUTED on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@undisputedonfs1?lang=en\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.

After Ammar took Seekers on adventures this year and also sponsored Nelly Attar to climb K2, I would like to also say thank you to those who support us through Seek Discomfort this holiday by taking a small group of 3 of you who purchase from Seek this Holiday on an adventure somewhere next year. We will contact the 3 adventurers by January 31st. If you have already purchased this holiday, you're already good to go :) if you'd like a chance to join me, you know where to go! ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ \n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort\n\nWhen it comes to what happened at the end.. It really shook me, we felt with the local team that we'd really prepared the best we could but sometimes unexpected problems like this one can happen. We've checked several times and everyone there is fine, they were really just looking for me. Nothing like this had really happened before even though I have experience traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and I understand that there are things you can and cannot do. I went home after this trip to mentally recuperate and recharge.\n\n//\n\n✈ Book an Adventure: https://travel.yestheory.com/\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n⁺ Seek Discomfort: https://www.youtube.com/seekdiscomfort\n📝 Follow Matt’s Newsletter: http://yestheory.com/newsletter/\n📸 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n🐦 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n🎬  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n\n☮️ If you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\n🎥 HOW WE MAKE OUR VIDEOS\n\n🎵 Where we find our music:\n1- Epidemic Sound.

{"description":"Only the second time that an undefeated Michigan and an undefeated Ohio State have faced off in the final game of the regular season led to one of the most highly anticipated college football game in years. No. 3 Michigan traveled to Columbus, Ohio to take on No. 2 Ohio State in ‘The Shoe’. The Buckeyes came out on fire, until a few long touchdowns from the Wolverines calmed the nerves. Marvin Harrison Jr. caught a TD just before halftime to give Ohio State the 20-17 edge going into the break. In the second half, everything changed. J.J. McCarthy looked outstanding. He finished the game with 263 pass yards and three touchdowns. Donovan Edwards stepped up huge, including the final two dagger touchdown runs to finish the game with 216 rush yards. No. 3 Michigan defeated No. 2 Ohio State in Columbus for the first time since 2000. The Wolverines will play in the Big Ten Championship game in back-to-back years next week.\n\n#CFBonFOX #CFB #MichiganVsOhioState\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest CFB on FOX content: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n \nSee more from CFB on FOX: https://foxs.pt/CFBONFOXFoxSports\nLike CFB on FOX on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/CFBONFOXFacebook\nFollow CFB on FOX on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/CFBONFOXTwitter\nFollow CFB on FOX on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/CFBONFOXInstagram\n\nAbout CFB on FOX:\nThe official home for college football on FOX — the biggest names, the biggest games, the highlights, the moments, and everything you need as a college football fan.

Entonces dona tus coordenadas al evento. Tendrás 0 coordenadas pero podemos hacer algunas. Cambia entre tu mapa rumoreado y tu mapa caro repetidamente.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone.

He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.
