We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé\n\n00:00 Stairway to Heaven, explained\n00:49 Are we prepared for this?\n02:36 Our first solo via ferrata\n08:36 We love Public Lands!\n09:59 Overnight in the mountain hut\n14:20 Emotional morning of the climb\n16:54 HERE WE GO\n20:48 THE LADDER\n29:52 BLOOPS","title":"WE CLIMBED THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS LADDER (2,000 Foot Drop)","duration":1858,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20221112","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cw2zzop8-A","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2Cw2zzop8-A/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":241516}}

{"description":"Karlous Bernard Miller is an American comedian, actor and rapper. He began his comedy career in Atlanta, Georgia and is widely known for his successful podcast/comedy tour The 85 South show, along with being a cast member on MTV's comedy improv series, Wild 'n Out, and his notorious \"Wildstyle\" battles with fellow cast members DC Young Fly and Chico Bean.\n\n\nIn this interview Marco greets Karlous and Karlous is immediately apprehensive of Marco and let‚Äôs Marco know. Marco starts with a softball question, ‚ÄúWho is Karlous Miller?‚Äù  Marco expounds upon Karlous‚Äôs answer and reveals that the production team found out that Karlous is big on relationships. The production team claims to know Karlous‚Äôs baby mama and takes out his phone and proves it. Karlous immediately changes his mood as the atmosphere tenses. Marco redirects the questions to women‚Äôs body parts and Karlous gives his opinions. The production team continues to make noise in the background. Marco goes into ‚Äúfact or cap‚Äù and Karlous reveals he hears old people in his head. Marco is interrupted by the crew who are ignorant to who the guest is. Marco has an impromptu meeting with his staff as he is frustrated with the line of questions. Marco asks about Karlous being a Donald Trump supporter and the staff takes exception as they try to prove to Karlous and Marco that there are facts. Karlous watches as the staff and Marco argue on the set.  A staff member exits as Marco chases him and all hell breaks loose as other staff bring a monkey on set and Karlous reacts. Marco and the producer argue off set and Karlous is astonished at the monkey and hysteria. Karlous talks to one of the staff members and is baffled at the unprofessional antics and a monkey being put on his lap. The staff brings out another monkey and things get hairy. Marco attempts to reset and interview Karlous but Karlous is not in the mood. Marco is told by the producer he needs to reset and Marco is not hearing it. Marco tries to end the interview by getting a drop but that goes left as well. The staff continues to try and get it together as things go completely downhill‚Ä¶\n\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries  IG @therealdavemays @igobybrettj\n\n\nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n\n\nDirector: Matt Ables IG @mattablespromotions\n\n\nDirector of Photography: Militant Guerilla Productions\n\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n\n\nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco\n\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Karlous Miller Talks 85 South, Comedy, Rap, Donald Trump, Real Prank + More","duration":1208,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20221109","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPUVKiLpmS0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uPUVKiLpmS0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":585978}}

It released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the series. It will be the ninth installment in the God of War series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War.\n\nRagnar√∂k is set in the world of Norse mythology but expands upon the previous game's narrative, with an even greater focus on exploration and open-world gameplay. While God of War (2018) allowed the player to access six of the nine realms of Norse mythology, Ragnar√∂k's expanded focus sees the player exploring each of the nine realms, including the new additions of Svartalfheim, the industrial abode of the Dwarves; Vanaheim, the lush home of the Vanir gods; and Asgard, the golden land of the √Üsir gods. Midgard, the primary realm of the 2018 installment, is heavily featured but is now a frigid wasteland, dramatically changed by Fimbulwinter, a three-year long winter that began upon the conclusion of the previous game. The Lake of the Nine, previously navigable by means of a boat in the previous game, is now frozen over. Svartalfheim is explorable to the same degree as Midgard was in the previous game. Alfheim, Helheim, and Niflheim all return, with an expanded focus and character exploration.\n\nTaking place three years following the events of the previous game, Fimbulwinter, a great winter that spans three summers, is drawing to a close which will begin the prophesied Ragnar√∂k. Kratos and his teenage son Atreus begin to traverse the nine realms to seek out a means to prevent Ragnar√∂k while attempting to uncover answers behind Atreus' identity as Loki. Their journey will lead them to T√Ωr, the Norse God of War. Their conflict will lie with Thor, the Norse God of Thunder.\n\n#godofwarragnarok #godofwar","title":"GOD OF WAR RAGNAROK PS5 Walkthrough Gameplay Part 1 - INTRO (FULL GAME)","duration":3455,"channel_id":"UCpqXJOEqGS-TCnazcHCo0rA","author":"theRadBrad","date":"20221108","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xy4NNqX_ZU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/0xy4NNqX_ZU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1993654}}

Finally, after nearly 2 years of battling concrete, the hotel for the American Hotel is DONE. Once again, we found ourselves in a place where no concrete companies would bring their trucks to our town. It was too dangerous, and there were easier jobs elsewhere. \n\nSo instead of sitting back and letting someone else dictate whether a dream happened or not, we got to WORK. In the end, we broke open and mixed 1,500 ninety pound bags of concrete and got the job done. It was one of the craziest few days up here at Cerro Gordo. \n\nI have to give a HUGE shoutout to everyone who has helped out these past few weekends to make this possible - Aaron C, Scotty, Trevor, Phil, Pat, Craig, Dave, Jim, Marty, Aaron S, Hans, Christy, Paul, Daniel, Sabin, Elias, Damien, Richard, Andrew, Victoria, Chris K, Richie, Juan, Freddy, Elliot, Corbin, Jeff, Connor, James, Travis, Jake, Olmo, Brian, and many more!!

The rules are simple, Legendary difficulty skyrim with survival mode but the added twist that you are not allowed to equip any Armor or weapons. This is the hardest possible challenge skyrim can offer. You are effectively playing at 1 hp and almost anything will kill you and fail the run. Ontop of that in survival mode you must eat and sleep similarly to an indie survival game. You must also balance temperatures which in the cold northern lands of skyrim is rather impossible. \n\nMod Pack Used: https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/jqd9zz\n\nSo sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or surviving 100 days of skyrim hardcore is a task that is simply too impossible for this pro exploiter!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage.
