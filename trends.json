{"description":"Starship gave us quite a show during today’s first flight test of a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy rocket from Starbase in Texas. \n \nAt 8:33 a.m. CT, Starship successfully lifted off from the orbital launch pad for the first time. The vehicle cleared the pad and beach as Starship climbed to an apogee of ~39 km over the Gulf of Mexico – the highest of any Starship to-date. The vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble. The flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship. As is standard procedure, the pad and surrounding area was cleared well in advance of the test, and we expect the road and beach near the pad to remain closed until tomorrow.\n\nWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship.\n \nThank you to our customers, Cameron County, and the wider community for the continued support and encouragement. And congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting first flight test of Starship!","title":"Starship Flight Test","duration":3200,"channel_id":"UCtI0Hodo5o5dUb67FeUjDeA","author":"SpaceX","date":"20230420","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1wcilQ58hI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-1wcilQ58hI/hqdefault.jpg?v=643dc70a","content":{"View count":9280363}}

{"description":"Not all races can be won. #FASTX \nGet tickets now: https://tickets.fastxmovie.com/\n\nThe end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga\n\nOfficial Motion Picture Soundtrack Pre-Save: https://fastx.lnk.to/soundtrack!Trailer\nGasolina Remix: https://fastx.lnk.to/GasolinaRemix!FastX","title":"FAST X | Official Trailer 2","duration":156,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230419","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOb15GVFZxU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOb15GVFZxU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5442797}}

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"Spring Thaw!

{"description":"An overview of the 2023 Ohio train derailment.\nWatch this video ad-free along with lots of exclusive content at https://go.nebula.tv/practical-engineering\n\nOn the evening of Friday, February 3, 2023, 38 of 149 cars of a Norfolk Southern Railway freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Five of the derailed cars were carrying vinyl chloride, a hazardous material that built up pressure in the resulting fires, eventually leading Norfolk Southern to vent and burn it in a bid to prevent an explosion. The ensuing fireball and cloud brought the normally unseen process of hazardous cargo transportation into a single chilling view, and the event became a lightning rod of controversy over rail industry regulations, federal involvement in chemical spills, and much more.\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"At the Department of Collective Behaviour, part of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, researchers are putting locusts into simulated worlds, both virtual and physical, in the hope that they can figure out how devastating swarms form and move. ■ About the Centre: https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/ https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin\n\nEdited by Michelle Martin https://twitter.com/mrsmmartin\nThanks to David Walter for the suggestion\n\nThis is the most uncomfortable I've ever felt while filming, for a few reasons. First, of course, because of the locust swarm itself. Second, because animal research — even on creatures as simple and pestilent as locusts — always raises ethical questions. Now, the researchers are careful with the locusts, and I don't think many people could have a problem with this. Indeed, most of the world currently has zero ethical restrictions on insect experimentation — but it's still worth interrogating whether this is okay. And finally: because if we can do this so easily to less intelligent creatures... what's to stop something more intelligent coming along and doing the same to us?\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo","title":"It's the Matrix, but for locusts.","duration":424,"channel_id":"UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A","author":"Tom Scott","date":"20230417","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRIBVykhpC4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KRIBVykhpC4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGFkgWShZMA8=&rs=AOn4CLDT-NqBWWIt6LbWxzDA41VNd7teWg","content":{"View count":1841501}}

But then it's up to you to achieve success and take over New York City any way you like.\n\nSlowly build multiple small businesses, grow them into huge corporations, or carve your own unique path – the possibilities are limitless in this vast business sandbox. You've never played anything like this!\n\nGo from a small apartment and public transport to luxury suites, fast cars and designer furniture. Put your money into investment funds and real estate. Succeed, fail, rebuild. But remember to take care of yourself, sleep and stay happy on your rise to the top.\n\nDo you have what it takes to build your own empire?\n\n\nGo from nothing to the most prominent tycoon in New York. Start a business, work smart, make it thrive and enjoy your life. How do you want to be successful? How far can you push it? How long can you make it last?\n\nStart your own gift shop, supermarket, coffee shop, law firm, clothing store, liquor store, florist, and more. You decide what success is - whether it’s a single shop, a chain of fast-food restaurants, a huge corporation, or making millions developing websites.\n\nTake out a loan, rent a building, design the logo, renovate the store, get stock, manage your money, hire staff, and build your infrastructure. Soon, you may have to start importing products from the harbour and distributing them through a network of warehouses.\n\nA bigger business means managers. Hire HR Managers, Logistics Managers, and Purchasing Agents. They all need desks and computers, so you’ll need a fancy headquarters.\n\nNeed a delivery truck? Travel to a dealer and buy one. Need food? Go to a supermarket, but make sure you have a refrigerator at home. Big Ambitions is a life sim where your character has to physically interact with the world to survive and succeed.\n\nEnter any building in New York and buy it. Go from a small apartment to a dream penthouse in midtown, a luxurious townhouse in Hell’s Kitchen, or a series of skyscrapers. Fill each with furniture that suits your style and standing. Invest your hard-earned cash in real estate to grow your empire. Take over the city piece by piece.\n\nSpend your wealth however you wish. Buy a big SUV, a speedy sports car, or the new luxurious Mersaidi S500. Maybe risk it all at the casinos or put your money into investment funds and reap the rewards.\n\nAs you progress, you always need to ensure you get enough sleep and stay healthy and happy. Enjoy the journey, for as you grow older, you’ll discover that money can’t buy you time... or can it?\n\nBig Ambitions takes what you love about the viral sensation ‘Startup Company’ to even greater heights.","title":"I Became a Multimillionaire and Turned an Entire City Into a Total Wasteland - Big Ambitions","duration":1827,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20230416","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77zyN0WUuE0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/77zyN0WUuE0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2410058}}

{"description":"Hello and welcome to another video!\n\nToday we’re going to be recreating a recipe that we saw going viral on tiktok last year: the mac & cheese milkshake! We thought that cheese foam on bubble tea was good when we tried it on this channel, and cheesecake is good too (hey - cheese is good in general, right?), so this recipe might not be all that bad, even if it was originally intended to be an April fool’s joke.\n\nSo bring on the dairy - we’re making a Mac & Cheese Milkshake! Let us know how you think we did, and if you might want to try this lactose heavy delicacy. \n\nAlso PS - we had a slight complication with our camera on set, so the wide shot is a little soft focused. We tried to fix it in post, but it is still a little noticeable.

Love y'all...Thank you.\n\nClick here to listen:\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/wiiltbam\n\nFollow DAX: @ thatsdax \nShot by: Logan Meis\nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#ToBeAMan #Dax #masculinity #manhood #manosphere #masculine #men #traditionalman \n\nLyrics:\n\nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road, and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not about how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nYeah\nI know this life can really beat you down\nYou wanna scream but you won’t make a sound\nGot so much weight that you've been holding but won’t show any emotion\nAs a man it goes unspoken\nThat we can’t cry when life gets hard\nUnconditional love’s for women, children, and dogs\nWe know that we just have to play our parts\nAnd don’t nobody give a d*mn about our broken hearts, yeah\n \nAs a man we gotta pave our way\nOur only function is to work and slave\nThere’s no respect for you if you ain’t payed\nYou’re disregarded as a human and you can’t complain\n And if you ever make it up and actually reach that place\nAnd find a woman that you love and give her your last name\nYou’ll feel the things that you provide is only why she stays\nAnd when you try to explain you’ll say…\n \nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not bout how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nDon’t give up, keep fightin’\nAs a man our son(sun) is our horizon\nAnd our father’s actions play a role\nAnd we end up like ‘em\nSo they can’t let us see them hurt\n‘Cause we’ll embody what they do\nAnd start a generational curse\n No wonder most men are so depressed\nAll the things that they can’t express\nThey go to war \nget thrown on the shelf\nThen go back to war with their mental health\nThen grab that bottle and ask for help\nTry to pull themselves out of h*ll\nThen fall back down and then realize that they gon’ have to do it themselves\n \nIt’s the circle of life\nAs a man you provide\nThey don’t know what you’re worth ‘til the day that you die\nAnd that’s when they start cryin’\nThen move on to a man to confide in\n \nThat’s why we feel\nWe can’t hide ourselves\nWe don’t expect you to understand\nWe just hope we can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and you don’t care about what we know\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n \nThat home\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. TBH this is the most excited I've ever felt about a song.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted.

In this video, we finish our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support this potentially history-altering theory.\n\nMY SOCIALS:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/miniminuteman/\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@miniminuteman\nE-Mail (Business inquiries only.
