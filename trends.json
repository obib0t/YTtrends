{"description":"South Korea and Portugal faced off in their final group stage matches. Portugal got the scoring kicked off early as Ricardo Horta scored in the 5th minute. Portugal would have another chance to score later in the half by way of Cristiano Ronaldo but he couldn’t put it into the net. Korea would answer when Kim Young-gwon scored in the 27th to bring the score to 1-1. Ronaldo would be subbed out early in the second half. South Korea got a few chances on goal off in the second half but nothing went through. South Korea would take the lead in stoppage time after Hwang Hee-chan scored on a beautiful pass from Son Heung-min. South Korea won 2-1.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #SouthKorea #Portugal\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

{"description":"Stephen Thompson | December 2, 2022\n\nNow that we’re back to recording Tiny Desk concerts in the office, home concerts mostly happen under special circumstances: when the artist is overseas, for example, or otherwise unable to get to Washington, D.C., when we’re recording. Given that BTS’s RM (aka Kim Nam-joon) is based in South Korea, we let it slide — not least because his team put together one of the most impressive Tiny Desk facsimiles we’ve seen yet. What really sets it apart is the huge array of shelf-bound ephemera, which is bound to have the BTS Army sleuthing in the YouTube comments. What’s a random tchotchke and what’s an Easter egg? Study the set closely!\n\nRM timed his solo Tiny Desk debut — which follows BTS’s home concert from back in 2020 — to coincide with the release of his first official studio album, Indigo. But he kicks off the set with an older track, “seoul,” which first appeared on his 2018 mixtape mono. From there, he showcases the first two tracks from Indigo: the rap-driven “Yun” and the funky “Still Life,” both of which are inspired by RM’s love of and fascination with painting.

Now this is picking up in the aftermath of the Holiday Special. Incase you didn't check it out there were a couple of things that were dropped in it to set up the upcoming film. James Gunn even said the Holiday special was helpful because he didn't have to spend time explaining why the Guardians had Knowhere and so on.\n\nSo the main pointers we learned from it are that they indeed own Knowhere now after buying it off the Collector. Though it was destroyed during the events of Avengers Infinity War they have fixed it up. We don't knwo what's happened with The Collector but his ship was spotted at the start of the Loki finale with him flying past the camera as we travelled out of the universe.\n\nOther revelations are that Peter and Mantis are brother and sister due to Ego being their father. This was teased all the way back in 2017 when a deleted scene of Mantis' mother was posted by the actor. In the group shot photo we could also see her at the back whilst Ego talked about all the children he had.\n\nFinally Cosmo the space dog was introduced who we'll talk more about in just a bit.\n\nNow if you enjoy the video then please hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe for breakdowns like this every day. With that out the way thanks for clicking this, now let's get into the Guardians trailer.\n\n-\n\nNow the trailer opens with the Marvel studios logo which then transforms into the cover of the Awesome Mix Tape.\n\nGunn has stated that we will be getting a third volume and after hearing how niche his song choice was for the holiday special I can't wait to see what he has here.\n\nThe Hall H trailer had the song Do You Realize by the Flaming Lips which was pretty fitting for what was shown there. That focused more heavily on Peter and Gamora realising that they weren't on the same page and her basically doing a it's not you...it's me.\n\nLike literally.","title":"GUARDIANS Of The Galaxy Volume 3 Trailer Breakdown | Easter Eggs, Hidden Details, Reaction & Rocket","duration":904,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20221201","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iPe8ndtXEY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5iPe8ndtXEY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":183020}}

A pottery wheel is a small table on which pottery is formed that is able to be rotated about an axis to form more symmetrical pots. In this case it is a slow pottery wheel meaning that it is turned by hand rather than being turned at high speed by foot power or other means. A wooden frame was made to hold the axle for the wheel and a cane strip was used to hold the axle on to the frame while allowing it to turn. Then a clay table top was made to fit on top of the axle. A stone bearing block held the lower end of the axle. A clay pot was then formed onto it whilst turning the table to better access all points of the pot. The pot was then fired and tested. The slow wheel is good for forming pots but is hard to set up. It also turns too slow for pot throwing (spinning the pot at speed and forming with the hands by drawing the clay up). Future iterations might be a kick wheel with a fly wheel for momentum or some other means of powering the while leaving the hands free to form the pot.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed to Malibu by _Grey’s Anatomy_ star Ellen Pompeo for a tour of her inviting mid-century beach house. Pompeo first went to scope out the property several years earlier, when the house was originally up for sale and _Grey’s_ was still in its infancy. “I knew I couldn’t afford it, but I didn’t tell anyone that,” she confesses. When the house came back on the market in 2013, she seized the second chance. As her fans know, Pompeo is a bona fide interior-design enthusiast whose past renovations include a modern barn in Sag Harbor and her main residence, a 1920s Mediterranean-style villa in Los Angeles. The addition of her Malibu home has only added fuel to the fire. “I am entering a very exciting phase of my life, if I do say so myself.”\r\n\r\n*Kitchen*\r\n(Similar) Flint Grey Marble Bowl https://fave.co/3EIH6Hk\r\n(Similar) Etsy Set of 3 Bread Boards https://fave.co/3FmGEAh\r\n(Similar) Serene Spaces Apothecary Jars https://amzn.to/3ENJ7SD\r\n(Similar) Modern Petal Backless Leather Counter Stool https://fave.co/3EPwBBY\r\n(Similar) Diem Tumbler (Set of 4) https://fave.co/3GWyTlr\r\n(Similar) Crisp Matte Black Dinner Plate https://fave.co/3FcQ2pN\r\nCB2 Trap Pitcher https://fave.co/3VDUJP2\r\n\r\n*Kids Bedroom*\r\n(Similar) Purple Moroccan Rug https://fave.co/3FdB17l\r\n(Similar) Geometric Grasscloth Wallpaper https://fave.co/3FdB4A3\r\n(Similar) Lovesac Bean Bag https://fave.co/3VzxPYW\r\nBackgammon by Suzi Kondi https://fave.co/3icmI9R\r\n\r\n*Bedroom*\r\n(Similar) Ace Canopy Bed https://fave.co/3ilS4Ll\r\n(Similar) Borrego Small Round Ottoman https://fave.co/3ELupvr\r\n(Similar) Montaigne Bedside Chest https://fave.co/3VDV2ta\r\n(Similar) Black Match Striker https://fave.co/3GW7eRG\r\nBlackman Cruz Workshop Vertebrae Table Lamp https://fave.co/3VkT6Ws\r\nLawrence of La Brea Area Rug https://fave.co/3F8pwNl\r\n\r\n*Guest House*\r\n(Similar) A Particular Kind of Heaven Print https://fave.co/3gJRs1B\r\n(Similar) Yasuni Midnight Wallpaper https://fave.co/3Vmd0Rc\r\n(Similar) Ashe Upholstered Bed https://fave.co/3EPxbzE\r\n(Similar) Tonga Pillowcase Cover Black Triangle https://fave.co/3H0FCuK\r\n(Similar) Samoa Aegean Grasscloth Wallpaper https://fave.co/3AXK9u9\r\n\r\n*Dining Room*\r\n(Similar) Santa Rosa Plank Dining Table https://fave.co/3AUzy34\r\nGino Sarfatti Dining Chandelier https://fave.co/3VBQ7IZ\r\n(Similar) Fishbone Cactus, Zig Zag Epiphyllum https://fave.co/3VEdEZM\r\n(Similar) Basket Burnt Rattan Large Planter https://fave.co/3VnW9xd\r\nMario Bellini Leather Chairs Set of 4 https://fave.co/3isxCs4\r\n\r\n*Living Room*\r\nSurf Tribe by Stephan Vanfleteren https://amzn.to/3OOStSF\r\n(Similar) Farmhouse Beads 58in Wood Bead Garland with Tassels https://amzn.to/3OM0wQ6\r\nDe Sede DS-85 Daybed and Lounge Chair in Cognac Leather, 1960s https://fave.co/3UqSAoU\r\nSanchez Upholstered Pouf https://fave.co/3UcMtEx\r\n(Similar) 4-Piece Gold Standing Fireplace Set https://fave.co/3Udxh9X\r\n(Similar) Chandigarh Style Small Wooden Stool https://fave.co/3VDB7ud\r\n(Similar) Seminyak Grey Indoor Outdoor Cement Planter https://fave.co/3Vb0R1f\r\n(Similar) Pottery Barn Green Moroccan Handcrafted Recycled Drinking Glasses https://fave.co/3OMxVu0\r\n \r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nDirector: Meg Sutton\r\nDirector of Photography: Grant Bell\r\nEditor: Alex Mechanik\r\nTalent: Ellen Pompeo\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nLine Producer: Joe Buscemi \r\nAssociate Producer: Josh Crowe\r\nProduction Manager: Peter Brunette \r\nProduction Coordinator: Carol Wachockier\r\nTalent Booker: Dana Matthews, Mica Medoff\r\nCamera Operator: Lucas Vilicich\r\nProduction Sound Mixer: Gray Thomas-Sowers\r\nProduction Assistant: Fernando Barajas\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Alexa Deutsch\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Jarrod Bruner\r\nSupervising Editor: Doug Larsen\r\nAdditional Editor: Paul Tael\r\n\r\nArtwork by: \r\nAmanda Charchian Courtesy of Fahey/Klein Gallery https://www.amandacharchian.com/ \r\n\r\n© Douglas Kirkland All Rights Reserved http://www.douglaskirkland.com/\r\n\r\n© Elliott Hundley, Courtesy Regen Projects https://www.regenprojects.com/artists/elliott-hundley\r\n\r\nFahey/Klein Gallery http://www.faheykleingallery.com/ \r\n\r\nErnest C.

{"description":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) 5th Mini Album [HARMONY : SET IN]\n'Back Down' MV\n\n[Apple Music] : https://music.apple.com/kr/album/harmony-set-in-ep/1655611884\n[Melon] : https://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=11112907\n[Spotify] : https://open.spotify.com/album/1JDHisMjuJ1QkhcXiiLnnX\n\n조화를 이루기 위한 방법은 다양하다. 진정한 조화의 시작은 서로 갈등을 겪어도, 더 완벽한 세상을 위해 모두 함께 한 단계 위로 나아가는 것. P1Harmony(피원하모니)는 다섯 번째 미니 앨범 ‘HARMONY : SET IN’을 통해 각자 다른 가치관 속에서 온전히 하나가 되기 위한 진정한 조화의 발걸음을 내디딘다.\n\n미니 5집 타이틀곡 ‘Back Down’은 언제 어디서든 겁내어 물러서지 말고 함께 헤쳐 나가자는 단합과 전진의 메시지를 담고 있다. ‘이겨 낼 수 있어 Together / Back Down, 절대 Don’t worry’ 등 완전한 조화의 모습을 향해 노력하고자 하는 피원하모니의 의지를 보여준다.\n\n타이틀곡 ‘Back Down’ 외에도 P1Harmony의 에너지와 포부를 보여주는 수록곡들이 담겼다. 친한 친구들과 함께 신나게 즐기자는 팝 댄스곡 ‘BFF (Best Friends Forever)’, 세상을 놀래고자 하는 멤버들의 자신감이 돋보이는 ‘Secret Sauce’, 나만의 색을 보여주자는 다짐이 담긴 힙합곡 ‘One And Only’, 우리는 결국 목표를 이루어 낼 것이라는 가사가 인상적인 ‘태양을 삼킨 아이 (Look At Me Now)’, 멤버 지웅이 작사·작곡에 참여한 미디엄 팝 발라드곡 ‘배낭여행 (Better Together)’까지 총 여섯 곡이 수록됐다. 특히 멤버 인탁, 종섭은 새 앨범 전곡 작사에 참여하며 P1Harmony의 이야기를 직접 꾸려냈다.  \n\n서로를 향한 믿음과 우정으로 단합한 피원하모니. 그들이 꿈꾸는 더 나은 세상은 결국 눈 앞에 펼쳐질지, 완벽한 하모니를 향한 출발점인 ‘HARMONY PROTOCOL’만이 그 답을 알고 있다.\n\nThere are various ways to achieve harmony. The beginning of true harmony is to move altogether to a next level for a more perfect world, even if there are conflicts. Through the 5th Mini Album ‘HARMONY : SET IN’, P1Harmony takes a step of true harmony to become completely one in different values.\n\nThe title song of the 5th Mini Album, ‘Back Down’, contains a message of unity and moving forward to get through together without backing down from the fear at anytime and anywhere. It shows P1Harmony’s will to strive toward complete harmony through ‘We can get through Together / Back Down, Never Don’t worry’.\n\nIn addition to the title song ‘Back Down’, the album contains B-side songs that show P1Harmony's energy and ambition. Total of 6 songs are included in this album: the pop dance song ‘BFF (Best Friends Forever)’ to enjoy with the best friends, ‘Secret Sauce’ showing the members’ confidence to surprise the world, ‘One And Only’, a hip-hop song with a determination to show one’s own color, ‘태양을 삼킨 아이 (Look At Me Now)’, with impressive lyrics that says we will eventually achieve our goal, and ‘배낭여행 (Better Together)’ a medium pop ballad song in which member JIUNG participated in penning the lyrics and composing the song. In particular, members INTAK and JONGSEOB participated in penning the lyrics of all songs in this new album and created the story of P1Harmony themselves.\n\nP1Harmony, united by faith and friendship toward each other. Only ‘HARMONY PROTOCOL’, the starting point for perfect harmony, knows the answer to whether the better world they dream of will eventually unfold in front of them.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony \n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony \n▷OFFICIAL TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_official \n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_members \n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official \n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony \n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #5th_Mini_Album #HARMONY #SETIN #Back_Down","title":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) - 'Back Down' MV","duration":226,"channel_id":"UCZECMCJJJE47ei170XCXgdA","author":"FNCEnt","date":"20221129","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE_I_HunRWQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hE_I_HunRWQ/hqdefault.webp?v=63844b7e","content":{"View count":3871353}}

Nick Daley’s summer gig as night watchman at the museum is a challenging job for a high school student, but he is following in his father’s footsteps and is determined not to let him down. Luckily, he is familiar with the museum’s ancient tablet that brings everything to life when the sun goes down and is happy to see his old friends, including Jedediah, Octavius, and Sacagawea, when he arrives. But when the maniacal ruler Kahmunrah escapes with plans to unlock the Egyptian underworld and free its Army of the Dead, it is up to Nick to stop the demented overlord and save the museum once and for all.","title":"Night At The Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again | Official Trailer | Disney+","duration":148,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20221129","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WdSQFdMYZg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4WdSQFdMYZg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":834586}}

{"description":"The simple genius of solar canals explained. The first 100 people to use code UNDECIDED at the link below will get 20% off of Incogni: https://incogni.com/undecided. The southwestern U.S. is in the throes of a “megadrought” so severe that we’ve broken the record — all 1,200 years of it.

{"description":"When Jennifer Lopez wrote ‘This is Me...Then’ she had just met the love of her life: Ben Affleck. After much public scrutiny and an engagement ring, the two famously called off their wedding. Now, 20 years later, Jennifer Lopez is married to Ben and sitting down with Zane Lowe to discuss her upcoming ninth studio album ‘This is Me…Now’. \n\nJ Lo reflects on the conversation behind the title of the album 'This Is Me...Then', which spawned the hit \"Jenny from the Block\" and captured the chapter of her life where she met her soulmate. In a wide-ranging conversation, she discusses the uncanny experience of writing the future of her love story with Ben, feeling most musically inspired when she is in love, facing heartbreak publicly, and reuniting with the love of her life.\n\n‘This is Me…Now’ is Jennifer coming from a healed perspective and wants to let people know how in love she truly is.\n\nListen to Jennifer Lopez on Apple Music: https://apple.co/JLoYT\n\n00:00 - “This Is Me… Then”\n10:10 - Relationship with Ben Affleck\n17:45 - Break Up and Self Love\n29:27 - Recording New Music\n38:39 - Representing Latino Culture\n45:22 -  “This Is Me… Now”\n\nSubscribe to Apple Music: https://apple.co/AppleMusicYT\n\nFollow Apple Music:\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@applemusic\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/applemusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/applemusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/applemusic\n\nWatch more Apple Music: \nWhat’s New: https://apple.co/2VFatTU\nApple Music Up Next: https://apple.co/2MLktXE\nInterviews: https://apple.co/32WnrPV\nWhat’s Trending: https://apple.co/2Meq89t\n\nApple Music lets you listen to millions of songs, online or off, totally ad-free.

After Ammar took Seekers on adventures this year and also sponsored Nelly Attar to climb K2, I would like to also say thank you to those who support us through Seek Discomfort this holiday by taking a small group of 3 of you who purchase from Seek this Holiday on an adventure somewhere next year. We will contact the 3 adventurers by January 31st. If you have already purchased this holiday, you're already good to go :) if you'd like a chance to join me, you know where to go! ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ \n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort\n\nWhen it comes to what happened at the end.. It really shook me, we felt with the local team that we'd really prepared the best we could but sometimes unexpected problems like this one can happen. We've checked several times and everyone there is fine, they were really just looking for me. Nothing like this had really happened before even though I have experience traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and I understand that there are things you can and cannot do.

{"description":"Aaron Rodgers left last night’s loss to the Philadelphia Eagles with a rib injury. Despite appearing to be in pain while on the field, Rodgers said that he is not ruling out next week against the Bears if he checks out fine this week. He is scheduled for X-Rays today. Jordan Love came in relief of Rodgers and immediately led the Green Bay Packers on a scoring drive.
