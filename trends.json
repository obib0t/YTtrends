{"description":"Watch the Official Trailer for #TheRingsOfPower now. Join us in Middle-earth on September 2.\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power - Official Trailer | Prime Video","duration":160,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220823","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8UAUAuKNcU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8UAUAuKNcU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2295895}}

The new HBO Show is packed with easter eggs, callbacks and a lot of big characters that we're gonna be analysing in this video.\n\nThe entire series is based on the final third part of Fire And Blood which tells the tale of the Targaryen lineage all duking it out to take their place on the Iron Throne. As we know come Game Of Thrones, the entire House was left almost extinct and this series will be talking about how the house of cards came crashing down.\n\nBeginning at Chapter 12's Heirs Of The Dragon, the original work recounts all the ins and outs of the family tree and it basically gives the idea - if you want to be happy living a kings life, never make a pretty neice your wife.\n\nNow whether you've read it or not doesn't really matter as this breakdown will be covering it all and after becoming an expert on it last night...what did no one else do the reading? I'm here to give you the ins and outs on every single character. Because of this there might be some spoilers but I promise you that I'll not give away any of the big twists or deaths in this video, I just wanna really use the book to add some insight to the characters.\n\nIf you've read it then you'll know that it mores like a text book rather than being a story and because of this it's a bit of a slog to get through.\n\nThere's massive pages that basically just list character names, talk about them for a bit and then that's it. However it actually gives the series a massive advantage as it means that they can pick certain sections and expand on them massively. They have a few plot points that they have to stick to but beyond that they can go wild with it and it leads to this being such a good first episode.\n\nThis show takes place roughly 172 years before the death of the Mad King and the birth of Daenerys.\n\nMusic By - Steesh\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"HOUSE OF THE DRAGON Episode 1 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review & Game Of Thrones Easter Eggs","duration":1245,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20220822","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcN_XnTIKVE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wcN_XnTIKVE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":420328}}

{"description":"In Episode 204 of Mike Finnegan's Garage we hang out at Motor Trend's Roadkill Nights event, which is powered by Dodge. The event is unique because the city of Pontiac, Michigan, allows Roadkill to hold street legal drag racing right on Woodward ave. Newbern and I drove the Roadkill ramp truck there while hauling precious cargo as part of a really cool upcoming episode of Roadkill, which you can see of Motor Trend Plus streaming app. Rather than drive all the way back home to Georgia with an empty ramp truck, we decided to buy a really rusty and slightly butchered pro street 1970 Dodge Charger. The car is a mess but I have a vision and a few used speed parts that will someday go on this car. In the meantime, enjoy the trip and the fun of celebrating Mike Cotten's new car that he bought at RKN as well! \nWant to help support this channel?

{"description":"My husband Dave and I discovered this abandoned survival bunker on land we bought in Interior Alaska. It had been occupied by a prepper it seemed, and then left to the elements with a bad roof for decades.\n\nIt seemed very daunting to clean it up after our first effort, and we let it sit a few weeks, deciding what to do with it. (Clean it up? Burn it? Leave it and move on to working the better part of the property?)  \n\nIn the meantime, Dave traveled to Michigan to begin a new project and I.... I couldn't sleep thinking about this mess sitting on our new property.\nSo- I got a dumpster delivered.

{"description":"Rents in New York City are at an all-time high. The median asking rent in Manhattan reached $4,100 in June 2022. CNBC Make It spoke to three New Yorkers whose rents increased up to $2,100 a month.\n\nBut are New Yorkers willing to pay up? One challenge for renters is the requirement that they earn 40 times the rent when applying for an apartment. With the median asking rent in Manhattan around $4,000, that means the minimum income to qualify for an apartment at that price is $160,000. The median household income in New York City is $67,000. \n\nCorrection (Aug. 23rd, 2022): At 01:46 the video misidentified that Thelma Annan is 32 years old.

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #northpole #travel #travelvlog #arcticcruise\n\n0:00 2 week cruise to the NORTH POLE?!\n0:38 Flying to the northernmost city in the world\n2:01 Full tour of our luxury ice breaker ship!\n5:47 Deck 5: where things get interesting\n6:46 Why we love Athletic Greens\n7:58 First sight of ICE\n10:40 Restaurant #1\n11:14 Deck 6: Helicopter pad\n13:00 Deck 7: Luxury Duplex Suite\n13:25 The Bridge\n14:20 The Science Lab\n15:25 Deck 9: The Spa\n16:25 Fitness Center\n17:08 The Main Lounge\n18:18 Restraunt #2\n18:50 Outdoor heated pool\n20:05 Gala evening\n21:34 Midnight sun!!!","title":"WE BOARDED A CRUISE TO THE NORTH POLE (Full Ship Tour)","duration":1399,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220820","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb4cCdLiuSg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kb4cCdLiuSg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1019873}}

{"description":"Bailey Zimmerman - Where It Ends (Lyric Video)\n\n📱 Text me - 618.228.3400 or click the link https://my.community.com/baileyzimmerman\n\nFollow Bailey on Socials!\nhttp://www.tiktok.com/@bailey.zimmerman?\nhttp://facebook.com/baileyzimmermanmusic\nhttp://instagram.com/bailey.zimmerman\nhttp://twitter.com/baileyzimmerman\n\nEstablishing himself as one of music’s most exciting new voices, Bailey Zimmerman strikes a sweet spot between timeless American country, rafter-rattling arena rock, and authentic storytelling. It’s why in just one year’s time, he’s already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80’s hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song “Never Comin’ Home” amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, “Fall In Love”, “Rock and A  Hard Place”, and “Where It Ends”. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #WhereItEnds #LyricVideo","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Where It Ends (Lyric Video)","duration":180,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20220819","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7PHEPmdT1w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/C7PHEPmdT1w/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":772550}}

The album features four new tracks, including his current single “Come Back As A Country Boy.” Body Language Deluxe also features his Platinum-selling 28th country radio chart-topper, “Happy Anywhere” (featuring Gwen Stefani). Prior to “Happy Anywhere” Shelton celebrated a 2x Platinum, multi-week No. 1 with “Nobody But You,” which has now surpassed 280 million streams. The single made its TV debut on the 62nd GRAMMY Awards, where Shelton was also nominated for Best Country Solo Performance for his hit “God’s Country.” The 4x Platinum smash earned the 2019 CMA Award and 2020 ACM Award for Single of the Year. As his award wins approach the hundreds, Shelton remains a force in the industry with ACM (5), AMA (3), CMA (10), CMT (11) and People’s Choice Awards (7), among many others. He recently wrapped his headlining “Friends and Heroes 2021” tour with Lindsay Ell and special appearances by Martina McBride, Tracy Byrd and Trace Adkins.\n\nAs a coach for the Emmy Award-winning television show The Voice, Shelton is an eight-time champion, most recently with his contestant Cam Anthony. The Grand Ole Opry member also remains focused on his Ole Red partnership with Ryman Hospitality, with locations currently in Tishomingo, Nashville, Gatlinburg and Orlando. A noted humanitarian, Shelton has helped raise millions of dollars for children’s hospitals, disaster relief organizations, food banks and more in his home state of Oklahoma and throughout the entire country.  \n  \n#BlakeShelton #TeamBlake #NoBody","title":"Blake Shelton - No Body (Official Music Video)","duration":207,"channel_id":"UC9nxc-xiH1AnL9RGstfgurg","author":"Blake Shelton","date":"20220819","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDhDy9rPpiE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JDhDy9rPpiE/hqdefault.webp?v=62f517db","content":{"View count":394008}}
