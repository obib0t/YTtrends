{"description":"Discover a fairy tale with a wicked twist. Disenchanted, an Original movie, starts streaming November 18 on Disney+. \n\nThe digital soundtrack from Walt Disney Records will be available on Nov. 18 and is available for Pre-Save/Pre-Add at https://presave.umusic.com/disenchanted-soundtrack.\n\nIt has been more than ten years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) wed, but Giselle has grown disillusioned with life in the city, so they move their growing family to the sleepy suburban community of Monroeville in search of a more fairy tale life. Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn‚Äôt been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family‚Äôs future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.\n \n‚ÄúDisenchanted‚Äù stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Gabriella Baldacchino, with Idina Menzel and James Marsden.

The Japanese Defense Ministry said it also detected the launches and that the type of missiles used and their flight information were still being analyzed.\n\nSouth Korea's Foreign Ministry said its top nuclear envoy held separate phone talks with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts soon after the launches. It said the three agreed to strengthen trilateral coordination on North Korea while repeating their calls for the North to stop weapons tests and return to talks.\n\nSince late September, North Korea has launched a barrage of missiles toward the sea in what it called simulated tests of tactical nuclear weapons systems designed to attack South Korean and U.S. targets. North Korea says its testing activities were meant to issue a warning amid a series of South Korea-U.S. military drills. But some experts say Pyongyang has also used its rivals‚Äô drills as a chance to test new weapons systems, boost its nuclear capability and increase its leverage in future dealings with Washington and Seoul.\n\n¬ª Subscribe to USA TODAY: http://bit.ly/1xa3XAh\n¬ª Watch more on this and other topics from USA TODAY: https://bit.ly/3Uf6TNu\n¬ª USA TODAY delivers current local and national news, sports, entertainment,  finance, technology, and more through award-winning journalism, photos, videos and VR.\n\n#NorthKorea #SouthKorea #Missile","title":"South Korea retaliates after North Korea fires missile launches | USA TODAY","duration":71,"channel_id":"UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g","author":"USA TODAY","date":"20221102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzulTT93MVs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kzulTT93MVs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":325491}}

However, I never got around to building the Chum Bucket so that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing in this video! You might know that there is a real life golden SpongeBob house in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, but it costs $3,800 to stay PER NIGHT and no one can afford that so the next best option was to build a realy life Bikini Bottom in my backyard. This video was super nostalgic to make and we had a lot of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and I can't wait for you to see what's happening next Tuesday.\n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one! \nComment ‚ÄúKrabby Patty!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Built SpongeBob's House In My Backyard, But I Built Bikini Bottom in My Backyard!, But I Built The Krusty Krab!, But I BUILT THE SPONGEBOB PATTY WAGON, But 24 Hours In Spongebob's Real Life House, But I Built Bikini Bottom in a Fish Tank, But Trusty Slab üçî SPONGEBOB'S BIG BIRTHDAY BLOW OUT, But Spongebob In Real Life Episode 2, But I Built the Krusty Krab for a Real Crab, But SpongeBob Meets His Human Self! - SpongeBob In Real Life 10,  or any other video like Unspeakable, Ryan Trahan, Preston, Papa Jake, Aquarium Info, President Chay, JChaseFilms, MrBeast, Typical Gamer, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

{"description":"Making mezcal is really hard work. Mexican producers harvest agave by hand and cook it in giant, earthen ovens. Then they crush it using a 1,000-pound, horse-drawn stone and distill it in copper pots. Despite all this effort, Mexican producers aren‚Äôt making the big bucks, even though demand for the spirit is booming.\n\nWhile Mexican regulations do require mezcal to be made in Mexico, that hasn't stopped large, international companies from scooping up mezcal supplies, repackaging, and reselling bottles for huge profits abroad. And the only organization that can stand in the way, the mezcal certifying agency COMERCAM, has faced claims of favoritism of these large companies. This has left some century-old mezcal brands frustrated and fearful that their ancestral ways of making mezcal are at risk. So, there's a growing trend of brands leaving the certified industry and choosing to call their brands \"distilled agave\" instead of mezcal.\n\nMORE BIG BUSINESS VIDEOS: \nHow Junior's Bakes 5 Million Cheesecakes During A Cream Cheese Shortage | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/hktm2mvQKc0\nAirlines Spend Billions, So Why Are Travelers More Miserable Than Ever? | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/MhhJuDap4CU\nQuinoa Prices Crashed.

{"description":"A jury has convicted a Wisconsin man of killing six people and injuring dozens of others when he drove his SUV into a Christmas parade last year. Darrell Brooks was found guilty Wednesday of all 76 charges, including six counts of first-degree intentional homicide. He drove into the parade in Waukesha on Nov. 21 after fleeing a domestic disturbance with an ex-girlfriend. Dozens of other people were hurt. Brooks dismissed his public defenders days before his trial began in early October and defended himself throughout the proceedings. He was removed from the courtroom at times for his erratic outbursts and confrontational exchanges with the judge.\n\nSubscribe to FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClwddNv0Cr6SIEGkzVK886w?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch FOX 9 Live: https://www.fox9.com/live\n\nFOX 9 is your source for breaking news, live events, investigations, politics, entertainment, business news and local stories from Minneapolis-St. Paul, the greater Twin Cities metro, Greater Minnesota, western Wisconsin and across the nation.
