As Tommy leaves New York after losing Ghost, LaKeisha and the only city he's ever known, he makes a quick detour to close an old wound that’s been haunting him for decades. What was supposed to be a quick stop turns into a labyrinth of family secrets and lies Tommy thought were long buried.  One step leads to another and Tommy quickly finds himself in Chicago's drug game, inserting himself between the city's two biggest crews. In a city divided by race, Tommy straddles the line, ultimately becoming the lynchpin that not only unites them - but holds the POWER to watch them crumble. As the first season unfolds at breakneck speed, Tommy uses his outsider status to his advantage, breaking all the local rules and rewriting them on his quest to become the biggest drug dealer in Chicago.","title":"Power Book IV: Force | Official Teaser | Season 2","duration":35,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230522","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knFMIPwzP0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_knFMIPwzP0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":332304}}

{"description":"Get your tickets, you poor unfortunate souls, Disney's #TheLittleMermaid is coming to theaters May 26! 🐙🔮🎶\n\n“The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) as the voice of Sebastian; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca”) as the voice of Flounder; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”) with a screenplay by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”). The songs feature music from multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”) and lyrics by Howard Ashman, and new lyrics by three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), Miranda, two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), and Rob Marshall, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer.

{"description":"Fallout 4 is a perfectly balanced Post apocalyptic RPG created by Bethesda who are most known for the amazing elder scrolls skyrim. Famously Todd Howard designed fallout 4 to be perfectly balanced so today I have decided to make every npc and enemy in fallout legendary. That means you can now face up against legendary radroaches and every raider you face might be holding a legendary super upgraded rocket launcher capable of mini nuking your limbs off. So all of the classic strongest enemy tier lists and top 10 strongest weapons are out the window as its time to see if a legendary 100 stat man can survive in a legendary world. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience or I suppose as today is an mmo game asmongold. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:32 - Creating the Gigachad!\n03:08 - Our first encounters\n05:04 - 100 Stat Man?!?\n08:08 - Intro the world we go\n09:57 - Saving the Minutemen\n12:15 - Chad vs. Deathclaw\n14:03 - A behemoth of Legendary proportions\n17:04 - Moving towards Diamond City\n19:06 - Halfway there\n21:05 - Braving the Glowing Sea\n22:29 - Creating the ultimate weapon!\n24:57 - The Final Battle!\n26:26 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\ntitle: FALLOUT But EVERYTHING Is Legendary And Overpowered - A Perfectly Balanced Fallout 4 Mod \n\n#fallout #legendary #game","title":"FALLOUT But EVERYTHING Is Legendary And Overpowered - A Perfectly Balanced Fallout 4 Mod","duration":1617,"channel_id":"UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ","author":"The Spiffing Brit","date":"20230517","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ULVIgc6E4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u1ULVIgc6E4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":799083}}

{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by RuPaul to tour his dazzling Beverly Hills home. When the 'Drag Race' star and husband Georges LeBar acquired their home they enlisted esteemed AD100 designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard and architect Christopher Hatch McLean to help bring their 1980s palazzo to life. Together they transformed the property into an enchanting homage to Old Hollywood injecting the glamor of 1930s regency throughout. Bursting with color and pattern, RuPaul wanted the design of his home to evoke joy in those who step inside its doors - “The house is a touchstone to remind me to inspire people to feel the magic that’s seemingly so elusive these days,” RuPaul asserts. “It’s meant to be whimsical and fun.
