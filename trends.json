{"description":"Get Honey for FREE today ‚ñ∏ https://joinhoney.com/moriah\nHoney finds coupons with one click. Thanks to Honey for sponsoring!\n\nWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n\n_________FAQs__________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 27 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\nCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

So I decided to do some research and development to see if I could improve it's efficiency. From my research, increasing the number of fan blades from 4 to 8 yielded an increase of 19% volume of airflow. So I set about building a better fan. Instead of splitting the rotor and inserting blades made of bark into it, I made spokes from split cane to hold the blades leaving the rotor intact. This increased the longevity of the rotor as well as the spokes being heavier contributing more momentum, assisting the impeller in winding back in the other direction after each rotation. Instead of bark being used to for the blades, simple (and easier to find) folded leaves formed the blades. These, being flexible, are less likely to break against the walls of the housing as stiff bark does. Finally, a lid was added to the housing to make maintenance easier. The new blower works better than the old one with more airflow occurring. I experimented with different numbers of blades on the impeller (4,6 and 8). The more blades used, the slower the impeller can be spun to produce the same airflow. This makes it easier to operate as the users arms don't have to move as quickly, making it more ergonomic. This conservation of effort will be important in iron smelting later.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #MultiBladeBlower #Pyrotechnology","title":"Primitive Technology: Improved Multi-Blade Blower","duration":469,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20220602","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR9u2oLHFN8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fR9u2oLHFN8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":907861}}

With the Ministry of Magic in full denial mode about Voldemort‚Äôs return, Harry and the gang had to train themselves and deal with the crazy authoritarian Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix definitely raises a few questions though. Like how was it okay for them to have Harry do public manage on the way to his hearing for doing public magic? Why didn‚Äôt Umbridge break down the wall earlier if they knew where Dumbledore‚Äôs Army was practicing? Was that kiss with Cho Chang romantic or creepy?

{"description":"kenobi is once again reaching out to qui gon jinn, his old master. I guess in these 10 years he hasn‚Äôt been able to reach him. Yoda‚Äôs training hasn‚Äôt gone too well I guess.\nas he hears voices of the past, like yoda telling him only pain will you find, qui gon‚Äôs plea to train anakin, reverberations of anakin on mustafaor, we see Vader being put together, really connecting the fact that anakin and vader are now the same person physically. obi wan can feel vader, and tells quigon that he is coming. \n\nAs Vader walks out of his chamber, which looks lke the same one from Rogue One, we get a beautiful shot of mustafar and his castle. For those new to star wars, this is the same place where he fought obi-wan and lost, burning alive. This is also where in the comics, he opened a portal beneath his castle to bring back his dead wife padme, which of course didn‚Äôt work as planned. check out the marvel darth vader comics and darth momin for more about that.\nVader sits atop his obsidian throne, as he orders Reva around. Where is he, he says, and we hear this is james earl jones iconic voice. I feel it could be perfected with some audio engineering like how luke skywalker‚Äôs voice was made in the mandalorian, being completely computer generated.\nHe tells her that kenobi is all that matters, not the grand inquisitor. She clearly has lied and told Vader that Kenobi killed the GI, to which of course Vader will realize that this is impossible once he fights Kenobi and sees he‚Äôs pathetic.\n\nHe explains he knows what she wants, to be the grand inquisitor. If she brings him Kenobi, he will award her the promotion. If she fails, he‚Äôll terminate her. So Vader has definitely given the go ahead to the Empire to track Kenobi down, and notify him once they have him in near sight. Vader ends communication and gets up like a robot, his lightsaber hanging from his belt, emitter side up, just like the original trilogy. \n\n\nAs They land on Mapuzo, a mining system, we see a lifter droid and an R5 unit. R5 was the droid in a new hope that had the bad motivator, which was replaced by R2D2 to Luke Skywalker and Uncle Owen. This isn‚Äôt the same R5 unit, just a R5 unit.\n\nAs Obi-Wan looks out in to the distance, he sees dark side Anakin in his jedi robes. this is the first time we see Anakin played by hayden christensen in anything since revenge of the sith. I had to do a double take, I couldn‚Äôt believe it was him.\n\nThey enter a room that many Jedi have been in, this is a safe house, called the path. It all leads to Jabim, where they give the force sensitives captured by the empire, new identities and free them. As Leia asks what happens to them, it‚Äôs revealed no one ever sees them again. So I can say what happens to the is that the empire takes them in, and tries to convert them to the dark side. As Kenobi reveals carving on the walls from Quinlan Voss. This is amazing. We haven‚Äôt heard of Quinlan in forever, no one knew if he lived or died from Order 66. Quinlan was a powerful Jedi during the clone wars, he helped obi-wan on many missions and had a unique ability shared with Cal Kestis called psychometry.\n\nI think this is Hayden in the suit. \n\nKenobi runs away, and he‚Äôs stopped to see Vader infront of him. Igniting his crimson red lightsaber. Obi-Wan wants no part of this and runs away. Finally igniting his saber as Vader tells him he can‚Äôt hide forever.\n\nWe get the best line where Kenobi says what have you become? \nVader puases and says I am what you made me.\n\nThey fight and it doesn‚Äôt look good for Kenobi at all, Vader overpowers him and he‚Äôs literally toying with him. 10 years have led to this moment, where Vader wants KEnobi to suffer. He‚Äôs also extremely cautious, as in this 10 years he‚Äôs had time to reflect on everything, and realizes his loss could have been avoided had he not been so arrogant and quick to make decisions. Rageful Vader is learning about Kenobi, he‚Äôs more tactful, more experienced, and more patient, waiting for the right time to unleash. \n\nReva finds the safe house.\n\nVader lifts Kenobi with the dark side of the force, choking him, spilling flammable material, as Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber. \nIgniting the substance, Vader throws Obi-Wan into the fire, dragging him with the force, paying him back to how Obi-Wan left him on mustafar, burning alive. Telling him this is only the beginning for the pain he‚Äôs about to feel.\nVader clearly wants Obi-Wan to die very slowly, only after suffering to Vader‚Äôs enjoyment. That‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt go all out, he‚Äôs savouring the moment. Playing with his food before he eats. As Storm troopers come, Vader orders them to bring him, when one is shot by the lady helping obi-wan, and she explodes a cannister into massive flames.

{"description":"Listen to me very closely. School is one of the best opportunities to make friends that you will ever get in your entire life. I hated going to school, but think of it this way: You and a ton of people your age are all forced to hang out every. single. day. That's an incredible opportunity! Once you graduate, it'll get 100x more difficult to make friends, so make the most of it while you can.\n\nAnd don't forget: People won't remember what you said, they only remember how you made them feel.

{"description":"This is the really very final production version of the 1,000bhp+ Mercedes-AMG One. That‚Äôs right, on AMG‚Äôs 55th anniversary comes the long-awaited hyper-F1 car for the road. Not a figure of speech, but a fact, because the AMG One famously uses the 1.6-litre turbo hybrid V6 from Hamilton‚Äôs F1 car. Well, when Hamilton‚Äôs F1 car was fast. AMG worked closely with the F1 bods at Brixworth to build a turbocharged combustion engine with four electric motors: one on the turbo, another on the engine and two driving the front wheels, each able to spin up to 50,000rpm. The whipcrack quick V6 is mounted in the middle, and revs to 11,000rpm ‚Äì a little shy of Murray‚Äôs T.50 and the Aston Martin Valkyrie, but still. Eleven thousand. More F1 tech arrives in the shape of the MGU-K, which harvests surplus exhaust gas energy and stores it in the battery or feeds it straight into the electrified front axle. With everything singing together ‚Äì MGU-K, MGU-H, front axle motors and engine ‚Äì the whole thing punches out 1,048bhp. Hilariously, AMG can‚Äôt tell us the torque figure because of the ‚Äúcomplex drivetrain‚Äù. That‚Äôs right, the One is too complex for human minds. Estimated performance figures are as follows: 0-62mph in 2.9s, 0-124mph in 7.0s, 0-186mph in 15.6s and a top speed of 219mph. On the other end of the scale, it‚Äôs capable of just over 11 miles on battery power alone, while combined emissions stand at 198g/km. And how does this 1,695kg monster look? ‚ÄòMuscular‚Äô is how AMG describes it, and there‚Äôs no denying its presence. Low, wide with a ‚Äòwasp‚Äô waist designed for optimum aero efficiency, it‚Äôs said to generate downforce from as little as 31mph. Which should make the drive to your weekly shop very entertaining. It‚Äôs been a long time coming, but has the wait been worth it?

{"description":"We DARE YOU to find better import cars than we did on AutoTempest!‚ñ∫http://bit.ly/CarTrek7_1\nThanks to AutoTempest.com for sponsoring this series! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn the first episode of Car Trek Series 7, AutoTempest challenges the guys to find the best imported cars they could get their hands on. Since they'd have to be at least 25 years old to qualify for importation, the guys would have to choose cars from the greatest decade - the '90s.  Tyler brought a heavily modified BMW E30 325i hot rod from Lebanon, Freddy lets his JDM freak flag fly with an inappropriate Mazda RX-7, and Ed outdoes himself and shows up in the most offensive TVR Cerbera ever made. They are then told to meet at the Freedom Factory for a race.

Find out more in this Yelan Showcase F2P 4-star Weapon VIDEO!!!\n\nThis video focuses on exploring most relevant Yelan teams as well Yelan damage I've tested during the time I was given on the special miHoYo media server. These results we're compiled and compared when using Yelan Support build which is a rather unusual build Yelan uses but at the same time, it's really easy to get it up and going and see the results with her immediately.\n\nStill, Yelan skills are a bit confusing so I spend some time showcasing you how Yelan kit works and in sort of a way, show you the basics of Yelan guide you will see coming out in the future. \n\nSo while Yelan build and Yelan guide is a work in progress, this video focuses on Yelan showcase and Yelan gameplay - with a lot of really interesting teams, like Double Hydro Yelan and DPS Yelan team variations. Let me tell you - one of these teams blew my mind!\n\nYelan was released during 2.7 Genshin Impact update.\n\nGenshin Impact is an open-world gacha game that's available on PC, PS4, PS5 and mobile devices (iOS & Android). Genshin Impact features fast gameplay with best RPG elements in an action packed setting.\n\nMusic:\nGenshin Impact\n\nFootage:\nAll footage produced by Gacha Gamer.\n\nWe are in no way affiliated to the developers or publishers of the mentioned games.
