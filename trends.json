That‚Äôs why I was stoked when Adin Ross reached out and asked if I could build him a custom Cristiano Ronaldo statue to surprise Speed with for his birthday livestream! You see, I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, Giant Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom, and a Real Life Squid Games Doll), but I've never built something made of triangles. The Beem Team and I decided to take things over the top for this by making the statue life size and wearing the uniform from the 2022 World Cup. To top things off, we only had 7 days to build it because everything is always last minute. After doing 20 hour days, we got barely got it done in time and had to deliver it accross the country to California. Both iShowSpeed and Adin Ross were AMAZED at how good the statue turned out turned out! This build was a real struggle to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one! \nComment ‚ÄúSpeed Loves Ronaldo!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot i seen Ronaldo Vs Messi for the last time, But Adin Gifts IShowSpeed A RONALDO STATUE, But IShowSpeed - World Cup (Official Music Video), But Adin Gives iShowSpeed His DREAM Birthday Gift, But iShowSpeed Meets Ronaldo In Person, But KSI Facetimes Adin Ross & iShowSpeed on Stream, But Speed Reacts To Ronaldo's Saddest Moments, But iShowSpeed FINALLY Packs Ronaldo, But Packgod vs IShowSpeed, But iShowSpeed Reacts To Ronaldo Shouting Him Out, But Ronaldo Sent Me This, But MY BIRTHDAY STREM, or any other video like PACKGOD, Live Speedy, Speedy Boykins, IShowSpeed, Adin Ross, Adin Live, MrBeast, Airrack, Unspeakable, Stokes Twins, Ben Azelart, or Brent Rivera.

{"description":"In 2005, Resident Evil 4 changed the face of survival horror. The game‚Äôs phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer‚Äôs cover this month.\n \nWe visited Capcom‚Äôs headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil 4 and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. Viewers can also look forward to never-before-seen gameplay and a new Rapid Fire interview.\n \nBeginning today, digital magazine subscribers can read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley‚Äôs gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.\n \nTo keep up with all our coverage, bookmark GameInformer.com/ResidentEvil4 and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

These are just a few words that come to mind when describing this piece of art aptly named Cascade. Designed by world-renowned and internationally recognized designer, Wallace Cunningham, this steel, concrete, glass and stone structure cascades artfully along the mountainside. It sits privately on 5.61 view acres within Promontory and adjacent an additional 37.12 acre view corridor in Rockport Ranches to protect those amazing views of the Park City mountains.\n\nThis home is filled with impeccable custom furniture, flawless solid walnut doors, massive sheets of glass for windows, a glass & steel elevator & a stunning floating staircase made of floating walnut. The primary surfaces of the home are all covered in Serpentine Verde stone slabs, that have been brushed for the stone floors, polished for the stone counter tops and cleaved faced for the stone walls. A sunken hot tub with fire features, Savant smart home systems, Venetian plaster walls, and a cascading zinc roof are just a few of the extraordinary ingredients that makeup Cascade.\n\nOne whole wing of the home is dedicated to the three room Primary Suite which is a sanctuary onto itself and is guarded by a massive solid walnut door.

{"description":"British colonizers created a massive canal system in Pakistan ‚Äî and helped cause the country‚Äôs deadly water crisis.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn late summer of 2022, Pakistan experienced a devastating flooding event. An unusually severe monsoon season induced by climate change resulted in a third of the country being covered with water. Over 1,600 lives were lost, and water took months to drain out of lower-lying regions of the country, causing disease and displacement. \n\nOn the flip side, Pakistan is among the most water-scarce countries in the world ‚Äî expected to reach absolute water scarcity by 2025 if nothing changes. You can‚Äôt remove climate change from this equation, but an overlooked factor is the role that British engineering played in building water infrastructure along the Indus River and its tributaries, Pakistan‚Äôs sole source of surface water. \n\nA series of perennial canals, dam-like structures called barrages, and embankments were built to extract as much water from the Indus as possible and convert much of Pakistan‚Äôs arid landscape into farmland. But this water infrastructure exacerbates the destruction of flooding events and creates a hierarchical system along the canals in terms of water access. \n\nIn our video, we explain the design of this water infrastructure and how Pakistan‚Äôs colonial past has made the country‚Äôs relationship with water even more precarious. \n\nDaanish Mustafa, who we interviewed for this video, co-authored a report on Pakistan‚Äôs water crisis: \nhttps://www.usip.org/publications/2017/04/contested-waters-subnational-scale-water-conflict-pakistan\n\nWe recommend The Juggernaut‚Äôs reporting on the legacy of dams in Pakistan: \nhttps://www.thejuggernaut.com/pakistan-floods-dams-british-raj-colonialism\n\nFor more context on how Pakistan bears the brunt of the effects of climate change: \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/10/pakistan-flood-cop27-climate-change/671664/\n\nWe interview David Gilmartin for this story, who authored a book on the history of water engineering in the Indus basin: \nhttps://bookshop.org/p/books/blood-and-water-the-indus-river-basin-in-modern-history-david-gilmartin/6562597?ean=9780520355538\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Whereas the last two weeks have had us following the footsteps of Joel and Ellie, this one takes a big detour. Not only do we focus on Bill and Franks relationship but they also massively alter the way that things happen in the game.\n\nNow the first thing I wanna do is go through Bills story in the playstation classic for everyone who hasn't played it, just so that they can get an idea of how much things were changed and what we originally had the first time round. As always we will be saving future spoilers for the end of the video and if you enjoy it then please hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe for breakdowns like this every day. With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now lets get into The Last Of Us Episode 3.\n\n-\n\nNow in the game you arrive in Lincoln having just escaped the state building. This culminated in Tess' death and Joel and Ellie fled into a subway station after being chased by Fedra agents. You never really got to catch your breath and on the other side of this when you did slow down Joel refused to talk about Tess. This showed how cold he was and even upon reaching Bill you just played along that she was alive without ever correcting him when he asked about her.\n\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 3 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":2193,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230130","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAePlZC0sfc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZAePlZC0sfc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":509959}}

{"description":"Get Surfshark VPN at https://Surfshark.deals/Vanwives - Enter promo code VANWIVES for 83% off and 3 extra months for free!\n\nWhat is the truth about off-grid living? According to Google, it's living without the reliance of one or more public utilities. But the truth is much harder than that, and we discuss the biggest obstacle (and a totally unexpected one) at the end of this video. It's truly one of those things you can't fully appreciate until you've been there, but we're doing our best to share our knowledge and experience with you! And speaking of, this week we dealt with the reality of solar panels in the snow--lots of scraping! Not just our panels, but our walkway with our snow plow, which had a flat tire. You too can have fun surprises like this when living off the grid! We took our ATVs 4km (2.5 miles) down to pick up our Amazon packages, and had to get some supplies just in time for some real winter weather. Thankfully our propane stove still works when we have reduced solar charging due to snow. Were you expecting the reveal at the end of the video? What do you think would be most challenging about living off the grid?

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n00:00 the Winter Whales of Norway\n01:54 Day 1: ship tour\n06:36 Day 2: finding humpback whales\n11:56 Day 3: SWIMMING WITH ORCAS\n18:19 Day 4: breaching whales\n21:13 Day 5: Swimming with orcas\n25:06 Polar plunge in the Arctic\n28:07 Bloops :)","title":"Swimming with Wild Orcas in Norway (incredible encounters)","duration":1826,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20230128","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb03_fw4VmI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tb03_fw4VmI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":693546}}

Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea / challenge where you can steal SMP Minecraft player's lives. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is a thing. \n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\nThis series is inspired by ParrotX2 and SpokeIsHere's SMP Minecraft Series, as well as TommyInnit and Dream on the Dream SMP server.
