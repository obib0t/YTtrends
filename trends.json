{"description":"Today critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Rita Ora welcomes AD to London for a tour of her extraordinary Victorian-era home. Ora finished furnishing her new place with vintage finds from London‚Äôs famous Portobello Road Market - and most of the items she‚Äôd already owned and used in previous homes. Her sister and manager, Elena Ora, is responsible for arranging the furniture and interior designer Joanna Plant was brought in to add ‚Äúlittle bits and bobs‚Äù to tie everything together. As she works on her third album, Ora couldn‚Äôt be happier with the calm and grounding home base she‚Äôs created. ‚ÄúMy exterior self is super flamboyant, colorful, and I‚Äôm really proud of the decisions I make. Internally, my interior self is the opposite. I wanted my inner self reflected in my home.‚Äù\r\n\r\nRita Ora is an international critically acclaimed singer-songwriter with over 10 billion world-wide streams, four #1 UK singles, and holds the record for the most Top 10 singles for a British female artist in the UK in history with a total of 13. In addition to being one of most successful female artists in the UK, she also lends her voice to the series Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight on Netflix, and will star in the upcoming film Tin Soldier. As a multi-talented industry leader, Rita also launched the award-winning Pr√≥spero Tequila with Conecuh Brands and premier Master Distiller Stella Anguiano, where she serves as Chief Creative Partner.\r\n\r\nSee more of Rita's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/rita-ora-house-victorian-era-sanctuary-in-london\r\n\r\nShop Rita's home style!\r\n\r\n*Kitchen*\r\n(Similar) Set of Three Bread Boards: https://fave.co/3rtknsv\r\n(Similar) Ruffled Marble Bowl:¬†https://fave.co/3M8sOTu\r\nDelonghi Distinta Electric Kettle:¬†https://amzn.to/3EhmTK1\r\n\r\n*Bathroom*\r\nAesop Hand Soap:¬†https://fave.co/3SA4Bbt\r\nDiptyque Candle:¬†https://fave.co/3Cx8WX2\r\n(Similar) Hex Brushed Brass Towel Bar:¬†https://fave.co/3SROWV7\r\n(Similar) Huxton 2-Piece Iron Planter Set:¬†https://fave.co/3fwtGVQ\r\n\r\n*Bedroom*\r\n(Similar) Belle Nightstand: https://fave.co/3M5qr3Q\r\nCalypso Chandelier:¬†https://fave.co/3V0ItbA\r\n(Similar) Marilyn Monroe Vintage Print:¬†https://fave.co/3fJY8fd\r\n(Similar) Hand Tufted Tiger Face Rug:¬†https://fave.co/3CzOO6V\r\n(Similar) Feng Shui Red Resin Buddha Figurines:¬†https://amzn.to/3rrmHAt\r\n\r\n*Living Room*\r\n(Similar) Mid Century Modern Solid Teak and Brass Coffee Table: https://fave.co/3e0xJcU\r\nVersace Medusa Lumiere Ashtray:¬†https://fave.co/3UWXyLz\r\n(Similar) Margot 90\" Velvet Sofa:¬†https://fave.co/3RGuZ1L\r\n(Similar) Moritz Round Mirror, Brass 36\":¬†https://fave.co/3Ehkv6f\r\n(Similar) Still Carafe:¬†https://fave.co/3SCntGJ\r\nHermes Wool Cashmere Blanket:¬†https://fave.co/3RuY2Wc\r\n(Similar) 4 Piece Gold Fireplace Tool Set:¬†https://fave.co/3SDLVYi\r\n\r\n*Makeup Room*\r\nLego Brick Heads Spice Girls:¬†https://fave.co/3M5utcu\r\n\r\n*Dining Room*\r\nAnissa Kermiche Love Handles Light Gray Vase: https://fave.co/3EhbuK9\r\n(Similar) Recycled Glass Mason Jar Vase: https://fave.co/3Eh7nhq\r\n(Similar) Aurora Candlestick Holders:¬†https://fave.co/3fEVfwk\r\nDamien Hirst for Supreme Spots Skate Deck:¬†https://fave.co/3SU03fM\r\n(Similar) Ceramic Line Footed Planters White (set of 2):¬†https://fave.co/3e7laMQ\r\n(Similar) Aimee Dining Arm Chair:¬†https://fave.co/3Ei2Ew2\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

{"description":"The Super Mario Bros. animated movie from Nintendo and Illumination just got its first look in a new poster! Mario stares at the beautiful Mushroom Kingdom, with references to the Super Mario Bros. franchise in every direction. This Mario Movie teaser is an unbelievable first impression.\n\nWhen The Mario Movie was first announced from Nintendo and Illumination, people assumed it would be bad; Illumination doesn't have the best track record. Combine that with the Chris Pratt casting as Mario, along with other strange celebrity choices, and the ingredients were there for this to be another questionable video game movie. However, the new poster reveals that we may have been wrong. Could The Super Mario Bros. animated movie actually be... dare I say it... REALLY GOOD?!\n\nSOURCE: https://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1577297788513173506\n\nWelcome to Vailskibum!\nCartoon News ‚úß Reviews ‚úß Discussions\n\nSubscribe to keep up with my videos ‚Üí http://bit.ly/18ZdpzY\nNew to the channel?

{"description":"The 2023 Corvette C8 Z06 ($106,000 in the US, $128,000 starting in Canada) aspires to achieve a formidable goal: to slay supercar titans and crush its competition for a fraction of the cost. The mad scientists at Corvette say they designed it to have both the soul of a Ferrari 458 and the clinical speed of a Porsche GT2 RS. An extremely bold claim. \n\n670 horsepower. 8600 rpm redline. This is the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 in any production car ever. Will it be able to live up to its mighty expectations? Thomas and James aim to find out. We hope you enjoy the episode.

{"description":"Legendary Overwatch content creator Seagull broke an almost 2 year hiatus from YouTube to make a video explaining his disappointment in Overwatch 2. Of course, Seagull's video is excellently produced, but I can't help but disagree with his pessimism when much of the boosts for the \"Early Access Overwatch 2 PvP Update\" are in response to his original criticisms in the State of Overwatch 1 video. Of course, it's hard to have faith in a new business model we have yet to see and who knows what state the PvED truly is in, but with tempered expectations for now I'm happy to be back on track at least for the live service PvP game.

This review will contain some spoilers for certain things to add some context but I won't be spoiling any of the major deaths or reveals that happen down the line. Now the episode itself takes place during the red spring which was started last week with Laenas death. This happened during the first few days of 120 AC and like our own 20s it was complete s**t show. Shortly after this happened Harwin ended up perishing in the fire of Haranhaal along with his father Lyonel.\n\nIn the books Septon Eustice actually suspected Daemon of doing this and with the murder of Lady Rhea, Alicent might end up using him as a way to further push that side of the family away from the throne.\n\nI'll talk about the other events that happened in the year as we get further into the breakdown but the entire year saw some major shakeups that will have massive rammifications for whats to come.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but if you've been enjoying the video then please hit the thumbs up. Hit the subscribe button if you want your daughters to marry my sons and we can finally join our houses in this great union. With that out the way, thanks for clicking this now let's get into House Of The Dragon.\n\n-\n\nNow we open the book with Laena's funeral and all the houses gathered together to pay their respects. Ey shut up...he...he nah is pretty funny.\n\nAnyway her sarcophagus is clearly based on the ones that Ancient Egyptians used to bury their Pharaohs.\n\nThere is the Seahorse Sigil that the family has on the bottom and we can also see that there's a strong focus on the hair around the face. Like the Targaryens, The Valeryons were known for their distinctive hairstyles and that's why Alicent became so suspicious when Rhaenyras kids came out with neither.

{"description":"Shifting wind patterns are making extreme weather events more likely. This is because the wind, which distributes areas of high and low pressure along the latitude lines of the Earth, is also being influenced by climate change.\n\nThe wind is the motor for our weather. It brings us both sunshine and rain. And during the winter months, it regularly blows itself up into heavy storms. But throughout the globe, climate change is causing shifts in existing wind systems - with devastating consequences. Atlantic hurricanes, which build up over the tropics and often lay waste to swathes of land on the eastern coast of the US, are becoming more intense and bringing heavier rainfall.\n\nScientists are looking for clues as to the precise causes for the warming in the Arctic, where temperatures are climbing more rapidly than anywhere else in the world. In the northern hemisphere, rising temperatures result in wind systems ‚Äòtwisting‚Äô at 10-kilometer altitudes. The Arctic jet stream drives high- and low-pressure areas around the globe. It travels around the planet from west to east at speeds of up to 500 kilometers an hour. But in recent years, meteorologists have noticed more frequent weaker phases in the jet stream - with fatal consequences for Europe. Droughts like the one experienced in 2018 and flood catastrophes like that of 2021 are both likely to recur.\n\nResearchers on the island of Spitsbergen have already made an alarming discovery. Climate change is altering the wind, and the altered wind is accelerating climate change - a dangerous vicious cycle.\n\n#dwdocumentary #documentary #climatechange \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You'll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories- or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you're low on funds. Jobs and missions pay well, but you'll need to use that money to maintain your truck. When you think your truck is powerful enough, and you have enough bankroll for major repairs, use your truck to complete some of the map's challenges, such as races, rock crawls, hill climbs, and very destructive long jumps.\n\nIf you're not good with mechanics, don't worry. Your truck comes with a fully illustrated service manual. The town also has a mechanic who can give inspections, or even make repairs if you have the cash.\n\n- Fully integrated stock engine and drivetrain with over 60 stock parts, a swappable V8 engine with even more parts, and lots of aftermarket parts.\n- Upgradeable parts such as EFI conversion, headers, drive gears, turbochargers, several off road tire options, and accessories.\n- Fully responsive engine and drivetrain which exhibits true-to-life performance and auditory feedback on part failure, temperature, or fluid issues.\n- Miles of off road trails and roadways.\n- Open world game with freedom to play how you want to play.\n- Off road challenges; some which are difficult, others which are nearly impossible.\n- Make money with heavy delivery missions, rescue missions, collecting junk around the map and recycling it at the junkyard. Or work for yourself by brewing moonshine, logging, mining, or pressing your luck at the pub playing Texas Hold'em.\n- Day and night cycle, requiring you maintain your food, hydration, and sleep.\n- Softbody physics.","title":"How to Be the Worst Neighbor In Existence","duration":1058,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220930","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8KmRw8610","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/J_8KmRw8610/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2088295}}
