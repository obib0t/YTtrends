{"description":"The Exorcist: Believer\nOctober 2023\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.   \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar® nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own.  \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia Marcum), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil.  \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar® winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before. \n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid’s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela’s neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela’s friend.  \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award® nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.   \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty.  \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment.  \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Yücer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures.  \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever","title":"The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer","duration":183,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230725","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PIxpPMyGcpU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4462444}}

The ending of the series is now upon us and throughout this video we're gonna be pointing out the easter eggs, comic book call backs and also giving our thoughts on the series as a whole. There's some good and bad things that the seasons done and I wanna give our thoughts on the whole thing.\n\nNow last week was a pretty slow burn with us getting a couple of different plot threads setting up things for this entry. Gi'ah and Varra threw a funeral for Talos and he somehwat got his wish in the end. He wanted to show the president that Skrulls weren't a threat which he accomplished judging off the news reports.\n\nAnyway Gi'ah and Varras part of the entry closed out with them having a shootout with Graviks forces. As for Gravik, he killed Pagon for being a Pagon and we learned his true plan. Alongside wanting to start world War 3 he was also trying to get something known as the harvest. Turned out Nick had collected the Avengers DNA and if I ever get super powers I'm completely f**ked. I wouldnt wish having to collect it on Gravik but yeah...entire room...full of it.\n\nWhat\n\nGoing back to Avengers Endgame it kinda recontextualises Nick Fury's appearance and while he was at the funeral he probably had his agents out in the field picking up the sample.","title":"SECRET INVASION Episode 6 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review, Easter Eggs, Theories And More","duration":1620,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230726","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfMHx8xOHvg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KfMHx8xOHvg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":252444}}

Still reeling from Nolan’s betrayal in Season 1, Mark struggles to rebuild his life as he faces a host of new threats, all while battling his greatest fear - that he might become his father without even knowing it. Starring Steven Yeun, with Sandra Oh, Zazie Beetz, Grey DeLisle, Chris Diamantopoulos, Walton Goggins, Gillian Jacobs, Jason Mantzoukas, Ross Marquand, Khary Payton, Zachary Quinto, Andrew Rannells, Kevin Michael Richardson, Seth Rogen, and J.K.

Renowned since their inception for electrifying performances, The Rose quickly became one of Korea's most sought-after groups delivering a series of critically acclaimed albums that resonated with fans worldwide. In 2019, three of the band members temporarily went on hiatus to fulfill their mandatory military service obligations, during which WOOSUNG pursued a successful solo career, releasing captivating albums and embarking on sold-out world tours.\n\nIn a moment of sheer joy for their devoted fans, The Rose reunited during one of Woosung's performances in South Korea in 2022. This reunion paved the way for their first full-length album HEAL, which was inspired by the transformative power of music and the stories shared by both their fans and themselves. HEAL soared to #4 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, while their accompanying HEAL Together World Tour drew an overwhelming crowd of over 90,000 attendees.\n\nNow, with their highly anticipated second full-length album DUAL, The Rose takes their music to new heights. Building upon the emotional honesty and vulnerability showcased in HEAL, this latest offering explores the profound concept of 'balance.' Seamlessly merging light and dark elements, The Rose masterfully weaves emotions and sounds, capturing the dualistic essence that defines their music. \n\nDriven by unwavering dedication to their fans and the unbreakable bond of their friendship, The Rose continues to push artistic boundaries, captivating audiences worldwide with their soul-stirring music and unforgettable performances.\n\n더 로즈(The Rose)는 대한민국 인디 록 밴드이다. 보컬과 기타의 김우성(Woosung), 보컬 및 여러 악기를 다루는 박도준(Dojoon), 베이스의 이재형(Jaehyeong), 그리고 드럼의 이하준(Hajoon)으로 이루어진 이들은 2017년 데뷔, 화려한 라이브 실력으로 전세계 팬들에게 수많은 찬사를 받으며 대한민국에서 가장 인기 있는 밴드 중 하나로 떠올랐다. 2019년에 김우성은 솔로 앨범을 발매하고 성공적인 활동을 펼치며 솔로 월드 투어를 성황리에 마쳤다.\n\n2022년, 더 로즈는 3년 간의 공백기를 끝으로 첫 정규 앨범 ‘HEAL’로 컴백했다. 팬들과 함께 만들었던 이야기들과 음악의 힘에서 영감을 받아 제작된 'HEAL'은 빌보드의 히트시커스 차트에서 4위를 기록하였고, 'HEAL Together World Tour’는 9만 명이 넘는 관객들과 함께했다.\n\n이어서 두 번째 정규 앨범 'DUAL'로 돌아온 더 로즈는 한층 더 성장된 더 로즈의 음악적 스펙트럼을 보여준다. 'HEAL'에서 보여준 감정의 정직함을 이번 앨범에서 '균형'이라는 개념으로 탐구한다. 빛과 어둠의 사이에서, 더 로즈는 여러 사운드를 섞어내며 그들의 음악을 정의하는 이중성을 포착했다. 더 로즈는 예술적 경계를 끊임없이 넓혀가며 영혼을 뒤흔드는 음악과 잊지 못할 라이브 공연으로 전세계 음악 팬들을 사로잡고 있다.\n\n#TheRose #더로즈 #backtome","title":"The Rose (더로즈) – Back To Me | Official Video","duration":233,"channel_id":"UClcbcYLmTpDeuK1EFeqh5uA","author":"The Rose","date":"20230721","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuzLp9gDcwY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fuzLp9gDcwY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":5437869}}
