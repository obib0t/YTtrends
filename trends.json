{"description":"Dead Space reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.\n\n\"With its stunningly redesigned spaceship, smartly and subtly enhanced story, and spectacularly reimagined action scenes, Motive Studio has managed to successfully breathe new life into the seminal sci-fi horror universe of Dead Space. Despite the fact I‚Äôve returned to the 2008 original several times over the years and found it to hold up fairly well, my latest journey through the darkened hallways of the USG Ishimura still managed to consistently surprise me and pull me into Isaac‚Äôs plight far more than ever before, while still satisfying my desire to butcher undead astronauts with an enjoyable arsenal of wildly unsafe mining tools. It‚Äôs clear that this superb Dead Space remake has been a labour of love for the team at Motive Studios, who‚Äôve very carefully balanced innovation and renovation with preservation, and to their credit the end result is undoubtedly the definitive way to experience ‚Äì or re-experience ‚Äì one of the best survival horror shooters that Capcom never made.\"","title":"Dead Space Remake Review","duration":630,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230126","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT882yrfSEc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/yT882yrfSEc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":367053}}

The series has had two really good episodes back to back and as a big fan of the game I've loved watching these first two entries. They do change some things up though and throughout the video we're gonna be going over the easter eggs, game differences and also giving our thoughts on the series so far.\n\nHuge thank you to everyone who checked out our video last week and like that one we're gonna be saving the more spoilery easter eggs until the end so that people who haven't played the game can enjoy all the twists and turns that come up in the show. I'll give you a heads up before we hit that and we start the episode off in Jakarta all the way back in 2003.\n\nIf you cast your mind back to last week then you may remember that they did an announcement over the radio that talked about the city and how something strange was going on there. Here we see it playing out with the outbreak of the infection being studied by a doctor. This wasn't in the game and I like how the series is slowly filling in the backstory of the virus. Both the beginning of last episode and this one had completely new bits in them and it's possible that we might even get a new story slotted in at the opening of each entry that gives us way more details on the infection than what we ever got in the game.\n\nWhen the title cards first shown we can see this is taking place on September 24th 2003 dating it two days before the outbreak. This of course shows how fast the virus spread and in the game we learned it was through products contain flour and yeast which we'll talk more about in just a bit. Huge shoutouts to Dyanmic Smurf on our last video for pointing out that 2003 was potentially chosen because it was one of the hottest years on record which a record breaking heat wave happening that killed 20,000 people.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 2 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":1737,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230123","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crDFaekrmLE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/crDFaekrmLE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":527655}}

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•","title":"33 Hours in the World's Best First Class","duration":1536,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20230121","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6hpzfYV2fU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6hpzfYV2fU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1336878}}

I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

{"description":"It's not you ‚Äî the dialogue in TV and movies has gotten harder to hear.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nHave you ever been watching a show or movie, and then a character delivers a line so unintelligible you have to scramble to find the remote and rewind? For me, this moment came during the climax of the Pete Davidson film ‚ÄúThe King of Staten Island,‚Äù where his most important line was impossible to understand. \n\nI had to rewind three times ‚Äî and eventually put subtitles on ‚Äî to finally pick up what he was saying.\n\nThis experience isn‚Äôt unique ‚Äî gather enough people together and you can generally separate them into two categories: People who use subtitles, and people who don‚Äôt. And according to a not-so-scientific YouTube poll we ran on our Community tab, the latter category is an endangered species ‚Äî 57% of you said you always use subtitles, while just 12% of you said you generally don‚Äôt.\n \nBut why do so many of us feel that we need subtitles to understand the dialogue in the things we watch?\n\nThe answer to that question is complex ‚Äì and we get straight to the bottom of it in this explainer, with the help of dialogue editor Austin Olivia Kendrick.\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Use my code PAOLO15 at https://partner.bokksu.com/paolo15  to get $15 off your first Bokksu Japanese snack box!\n\nThis is a Japan behind the counter food tour of a local Japanese bento shop. For more than 40 years, Bento Kawano has been making delicious Japanese handmade bento lunches at the affordable price of 600yen. At this value and quality it‚Äôs no surprise everyday that the customer lunch lines wrap around the entire block.  One important things about this Japanese bento shop is that they must be extra careful about food safety.  Since Bentos are designed to be able to sit on the shelf for several hours without refrigeration, the food must always be fully cooked. Run by Japanese food craftsman, Inoue san, he changes the menu everyday so his customers have something to look forward to.  He particularly enjoys analyzing the performance of his previous bentos and creating new ones to see how popular it will be, but ultimately he says that whatever bento he serves, he creates each one as if he‚Äôll be sharing it with his loved ones. Interestingly, this Tokyo bento shop runs 4 rice cookers simultaneously throughout the entire day to keep up with the demand using a special hitomebore rice from Miyagi prefecture known for its exquisite taste especially when its cooled down.  Even the rice at the shop was specifically selected by Inoue san.  I hope you enjoy this Tokyo Hidden gem bento shop.   \n\nBento Kawano\n- https://goo.gl/maps/LUWZtAGDey1msVFw6\n- https://www.genkigohan.com/\n\nWatch more Japan Behind the Counter videos here\n- https://tokyozebra.com/btc\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n___ Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ___\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?
