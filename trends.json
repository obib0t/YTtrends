{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by RuPaul to tour his dazzling Beverly Hills home. When the 'Drag Race' star and husband Georges LeBar acquired their home they enlisted esteemed AD100 designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard and architect Christopher Hatch McLean to help bring their 1980s palazzo to life. Together they transformed the property into an enchanting homage to Old Hollywood injecting the glamor of 1930s regency throughout. Bursting with color and pattern, RuPaul wanted the design of his home to evoke joy in those who step inside its doors - “The house is a touchstone to remind me to inspire people to feel the magic that’s seemingly so elusive these days,” RuPaul asserts. “It’s meant to be whimsical and fun. None of it is to be taken too seriously—except for love and kindness.”\r\n\r\nSee more of RuPaul's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/rupaul-beverly-hills-home\r\n\r\nShop RuPaul’s home style!\r\n\r\nWallpaper: \r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Landscape Wallpaper: https://fave.co/3M751nv\r\n(Similar) Etsy Black and White Stripe Wallpaper: https://fave.co/44ZX1xj\r\n(Similar) Etsy Leopard Wallpaper: https://fave.co/41xVA6p\r\n\r\nAccessories: \r\n(Similar) Amazon 8” Disco Ball: https://amzn.to/3Oe7dMQ\r\n(Similar) Etsy Donna Summer in Cat Eye Glasses: https://fave.co/3MqaN54\r\n(Similar) Etsy Diana Ross Canvas Print: https://fave.co/3MsIDX1\r\n(Similar) Etsy Glass Mannequin Head: https://fave.co/3BtcqIW\r\n(Similar) Etsy Chevron Pillow: https://fave.co/41BVPNQ\r\n(Similar) Rejuvenation Large Antique Terracotta Planter: https://fave.co/3MdvMqC\r\nNeiman Marcus Les Ottomans Ikat Gold Wine Glasses: https://fave.co/3M7W0KO\r\nNeiman Marcus Les Ottomans Ikat Gold Tumbler Glasses: https://fave.co/42DZb4b\r\n(Similar) Etsy Snake Napkin Rings: https://fave.co/42DZlbN\r\nMoro Head Lady Vase: https://fave.co/41IQ0xP\r\n(Similar) Amazon Resin Sculpture: https://amzn.to/3MuA4ey\r\n(Similar) Etsy Large Marble Serving Bowl: https://fave.co/3Mv7dXv\r\n(Similar) Etsy Malachite Obelisks: https://fave.co/42AVNqt\r\n\r\nFurniture: \r\n(Similar) Kathy Kuo Home Regency Lacquer Chair: https://fave.co/3o211ga\r\n(Similar) 1stdibs Louis XV Armchairs, Pair: https://fave.co/42WI2lP\r\n(Similar) Etsy Louis XV Noir Desk: https://fave.co/3W3mQbM\r\n\r\nLighting: \r\nLumens Hexsation Pendant by Martyn Lawrence Bullard: https://fave.co/3M3LdBn\r\n(Similar) Kathy Kuo Home Saura Coastal Beach Leaf Pendant: https://fave.co/3WcLLcT\r\n(Similar) SoHo Home Treviso Chandelier: https://fave.co/3IaDgcB\r\n1stdibs Pair of Chocolate Honeycomb Lamps by Gerald Thurston: https://fave.co/3W21zzb\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nDirector: Hiatt Woods\r\nDirector of Photography: Grant Bell\r\nEditor: Alex Mechanik\r\nHost: RuPaul\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nLine Producer: Joe Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Josh Crowe\r\nProduction Manager: Peter Brunette\r\nTalent Booker: Dana Mathews\r\nCamera Operator: Malcolm Cook\r\nAudio: Cassiano Pereira\r\nProduction Assistant: Fernando Barajas\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nJunior Editor: Paul Tael\r\nAssistant Editor: Justin Symonds\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

{"description":"Anamaria Sayre | May 15, 2023\nArriving at the Tiny Desk not long after becoming the first female artist to have a Spanish-language album top the Billboard 200 chart, Colombian singer Karol G shined brighter than ever. With an all-female crew backing her, the proud energia femenina and the prowess of a band dominated exclusively by women is undeniably brilliant here. It was also the first time in many years, she said, that she hadn't rehearsed without her typical on-stage equipment, like in-ear monitors. \"I forgot how cool it feels,\" she said. Authenticity isn't a prescription for Karol G, it's a natural state — something that she carries with her, waiting for the next opportunity to reveal another version of Carolina.\n\n\"CAROLINA,\" her given name, was also the title of the opening track of her performance, as she got to jamming in a manner atypical for the superstar. Trading her flute and trumpet for an accordion and tuba she \"bring[s] some Mexican vibe to this place,\" she said, with \"GUCCI LOS PAÑOS.\" She paused between songs and offered a cheers to the room, admitting that she had meant to sip her Mezcalito before the previous song.\n\nShe emphasized the rawness of the moment by slowing things down for a stripped down, reggae-leaning version of \"PERO TÚ.\" Sliding seamlessly into a bossa nova-esque \"MERCURIO\" — the version she wishes she'd included on the album — \"La Bichota\" brought the music back up and danced herself off stage. Away from the stadium lights, Karol G's performance wasn't just a blip of normalcy for the pop star — it was permission from the self-described \"happy-heartbreak girl\" to get up, whether in the streets of Medellín or an office in Washington, D.C., and dance with every version of yourself.\n\nSET LIST\n\"CAROLINA\"\n\"GUCCI LOS PAÑOS\"\n\"PERO TÚ\"\n\"MERCURIO\" \n\nMUSICIANS\nCarolina Giraldo (Karol G): vocals\nSusana Vasquez: guitar \nJemma Heigis: piano\nGiulliana Merello: drums\nPatricia Ligia: bass\nCrystal Torres: trumpet\nHailey-Mae Niswanger: flute\nKatiuska Fernandes: percussion\nIrany Martinez: accordion\nIndia Anderson: tuba\nRob Trujillo: musical director\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre \nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nVideographers:  Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Pilar Galván, Jill Britton\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #eltiny #karolg","title":"Karol G: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1021,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230515","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8UWsFMVj_Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8UWsFMVj_Q/hqdefault.jpg?v=645e62a6","content":{"View count":913417}}

{"description":"The end of the road begins Friday. Watch the FINAL TRAILER Now. #FASTX \n\nGet tickets now: https://tickets.fastxmovie.com/\n\nThe end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga","title":"FAST X | Final Trailer","duration":272,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230515","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoOaKN4qCKw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eoOaKN4qCKw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":4171792}}

{"description":"The Calorie Challenge Almost No One Can Complete\nStart your own 90-Day Body Transformation today: https://bit.ly/BrowneyChallenge 💪\n\nThe average man eats and burns 2500 calories a day. But some people like Dwayne The Rock Johnson plan an insane cheat day where they eat an insane amount of calories consisting of their favorite foods where their childhood dream comes true. The Rock loves sushi, Chris Hemsworth loves pizza, Selena Gomez likes chocolate, Cristiano Ronaldo his go-to cheat meal is steak and salad, Rihanna loves her fries, Elon Musk has a long taste and Mark doesn't eat.\n\nBut I never plan on a full cheat day where I eat all those delicious foods... but I found an excuse.\nThere is a challenge on the internet that almost no one has completed and that is eating and burning 10.000 calories in a single day.\nSo let’s have our dream cheat day!

But recently, a new name has become synonymous with indie film culture and appeal, and it’s not an individual, but a studio.\n\nYou have to admit, their logo is pretty cool.\n\nA24 swept the 2022 Oscars.

But most importantly, they’ve garnered a reputation for quality — and their brand loyalty so strong that hipster film bros everywhere are wearing A24 t-shirts and caps right now.\n\nBut unlike Universal or Paramount, studios that have been around for over a century, A24 has done this in just over a decade. How did this independent film distributor transform into a major player in the entertainment industry in such a short time?\n\nIn this Vox Video, Nate Jones (senior writer at Vulture, and A24 obsessor) breaks down their history, and stratospheric rise to the top.

{"description":"Sponsor: Deepcool AK620 Zero Dark on Amazon https://geni.us/apRI9Q\nASUS' actions relating to the Exploding Ryzen CPU debacle are disgraceful and abrasive to the trust that the brand has earned. ASUS has demonstrated clearly it wishes to not only avoid supporting users, but actively engineers ways to abandon them. ASUS' updates haven't even fixed the problems, yet they posture as if they have while simultaneously suggesting that users 'just run defaults' on their $700 motherboards, as if that makes any sense whatsoever.

Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella grows steadfast in her purpose to stand for equality and liberation.\n\nCast: Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, Jerrod Carmichael Christopher Abbott\n\nSubscribe To Searchlight Pictures: https://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures\n\nConnect with Poor Things Online\nFollow Poor Things on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/poorthingsfilm/\nLike Poor Things on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/PoorThingsFilm\nFollow Poor Things on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/PoorThingsFilm\n\n#PoorThingsFilm #Searchlight \n\nConnect with Searchlight Online\nVisit the Searchlight WEBSITE: https://www.searchlightpictures.com/\nLike Searchlight on FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/searchlightpics\n\nPoor Things | Official Teaser | Searchlight Pictures\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures","title":"POOR THINGS | Official Teaser | Searchlight Pictures","duration":34,"channel_id":"UCor9rW6PgxSQ9vUPWQdnaYQ","author":"SearchlightPictures","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFu7ZH4y6J4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZFu7ZH4y6J4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2307792}}

But their mission is complicated by the beginning of a geopolitical firestorm: The American Revolution has arrived. In the seventh season of OUTLANDER, Jamie, Claire, and their family are caught in the violent birth pains of an emerging nation as armies march to war and British institutions crumble in the face of armed rebellion.\nThe land the Frasers call home is changing – and they must change with it. In order to protect what they’ve built, the Frasers have to navigate the perils of the Revolutionary War. They learn that sometimes to defend what you love, you have to leave it behind. As the conflict draws them out of North Carolina and into the heart of this fight for independence, Jamie, Claire, Brianna, and Roger are faced with impossible decisions that have the potential to tear their family apart.","title":"Outlander | Season 7 Official Trailer | STARZ","duration":162,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxurD9SYbog","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gxurD9SYbog/hqdefault.jpg?v=645d26e3","content":{"View count":7509514}}

It will demand your creativity and ingenuity in a way that few games would dare demand. It pays tribute to the things that have made this series so timeless, while also innovating so relentlessly that it will be the better part of a decade before any game is able to follow in its wake. Nearly four decades after The Legend of Zelda series made its debut, its latest instalment is a breathtaking high-point for the Zelda franchise, for Nintendo and for videogames.\n\nFor those that prefer write-ups, I've published a written version of this review over at Wellplayed.com.au.

{"description":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom reviewed by Tom Marks on Nintendo Switch.\n\nThis is an unfathomable sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas with an alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds.\n\n#IGN #LegendOfZelda","title":"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review","duration":876,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdVO_fYoF5g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZdVO_fYoF5g/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1756517}}

{"description":"What if we could actually USE nuclear waste?\nCheck out Storyblocks and sign up here for great footage: https://storyblocks.com/cleoabram \n\nSubscribe to support optimistic tech content: https://www.youtube.com/cleoabram?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch Johnny’s explainer on nuclear power here - and subscribe to his channel! https://youtu.be/QzTgZ6kOEM8\n\nNuclear waste is scary. Maybe you’ve seen it as glowing green goop in The Simpsons, or as a  radioactive threat on the news. Either way, you likely know it has been a major block to the use and improvement of nuclear power. Over the last few decades, experts, politicians and the public have had heated debates over what to do with this radioactive material created by nuclear power plants.\n\nBut what if there were a way to not just store nuclear waste, but actually USE it? \n\nThis video is about the effort to make electricity out of nuclear waste. Really. It turns out, we developed the tools to do this decades ago. This story is about a technology we left behind and the people who want to bring it back.\n\nFor this video, I had the privilege of visiting one of the largest and oldest research centers in the US, the Argonne National Laboratory. I’m incredibly grateful to the researchers and staff I met there, and for their time in showing me their work. I also had the opportunity to speak with representatives from Oklo, a company working on new forms of nuclear power, including recycling nuclear waste as fuel. One of the best parts of making Huge If True is meeting and learning from people pushing what we can do in the hopes of improving the world for everyone else.\n\nChapters: \n00:00 Nuclear waste isn’t what I thought\n02:21 How I got obsessed\n03:27 How much energy is in nuclear waste?\n05:31 Thank you Storyblocks!\n06:20 How do you get electricity?\n06:50 What is uranium?\n07:28 How does a nuclear reaction work?\n08:05 Why is nuclear waste dangerous?\n08:40 What do we do with nuclear waste?\n09:35 How do you make electricity from nuclear waste?\n11:21 Why doesn’t the US reuse nuclear fuel?\n12:20 Is recycling waste feasible?\n13:41 What is Huge If True?\n\nCorrections:\n07:09 The number refers to the total number of nucleons (either a proton or a neutron) in the atom, not the neutrons alone. A U-235 atom contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons (an atomic mass of 235). The U-238 atom also has 92 protons but has 146 neutrons (an atomic mass of 238). I should have said these *differ* by the number of neutrons in the atom.
