{"description":"Brazil and Serbia faced off in their 2022 FIFA World Cup opener with solid performances on both defensive ends. Brazil dominated in knocking shots off on goal, and despite their close attempts, were unable to find the net. The match stood 0-0 at halftime. The game took a quick turn after Brazil found their stride late in the second half and Richarlison went on to score his long-awaited first goal in the 62nd minute. Twelve minutes later, Richarlison went on to strike again with an impeccable scissor kick from the center of the box to hold the lead over Serbia. A beautiful 2-0 finish over Serbia for Brazil: a win to remain unbeaten in their last TWENTY World Cup opening games.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Brazil #Serbia\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

{"description":"Cristiano Ronaldo makes his fifth World Cup appearance with Portugal in the first match against Ghana. Ronaldo was able to find the net but it was overturned by a foul call. In an historic second half Ronaldo was able to score a penalty kick in the 65th minute becoming the first man to score a goal in five World Cups. The scoring would not stop there, as Ghana scored in the 73rd minute by way of Andre Morgan. Portugal’s Joao Felix netted a goal in the 77th to give Portugal the lead then Rafael Leao added another of his own in the 77th minute. Ghana added their second goal with Osman Bukari’s strike in the 89th minute. It was Portugal's first win in an opening game of the WC since 2006.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Portugal #Ghana\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

Para progresar en el evento de la comunidad, puede donar coordenadas del tesoro. Puede generar coordenadas de la nada. Necesitas la ventaja de bajo un estandarte y el rumoreado mapa del tesoro en el mapa estelar para que esto funcione. Ten algunos fragmentos de mapa contigo.\nColoca un costoso mapa del tesoro. Entonces dona tus coordenadas al evento. Tendrás 0 coordenadas pero podemos hacer algunas. Cambia entre tu mapa rumoreado y tu mapa caro repetidamente. El conteo de las coordenadas de tu tesoro aumentará. Continúe hasta que pueda cambiar a un mapa diferente. Luego intercambie entre esos dos hasta que tenga 300 coordenadas nuevamente. Ranura tu mapa caro. Donar coordenadas y repetir. Esto desbloqueará rápidamente todas las recompensas del evento, como el caparazón fantasma. No hay mucho más para eso.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.

{"description":"In this video I'm restoring a very small rusty and deadlocked Gressel bench vise. Its jaws are just 80mm wide. My friend has found this tiny vise on the steel waste and I thought this would be cool for a video.\nOn first sight it was only seized and had some additional holes. When disassembling I also quickly realized that something on the half round part was not right and after sandblasting I also saw pretty deep damages near the jaws. To disassemble the movable jaw I quickly made a tool to open the vise. There's also a video about that on my second channel „my mechanics insights“, link below.\nI closed the two additional holes with slight press fit plugs and closed the gap with welding. After filing the welds flush the two holes completely disappeared.\nThere was a bit of a mess with the threads at the half round part, so I decided to close them all with very tight press fitted plugs and cut two new M4 threads. That worked very well and these plugs will never ever come out again.\nOn the other deep damages I decided to weld up new material with cast iron stick welding rod. That was my very first time stick welding. Was a bit tricky to get used to it, but the end result turned out very well. I was able to file and sand all surfaces perfectly clean afterwards.\nI decided to paint this vise in a nice red (RAL3011) with white highlights on the lettering.\nAs the spindle only had very little rust, I was able to clean it very nicely with rust remover, wire brush, some sandpaper and Scotch Brite.\nFor the remaining parts I first removed the deep pitting, removed the sharp edges, recut the threads and then sandblasted them to remove the remaining rust and make a nice and even texture on the sanded surfaces. To darken all these parts I used the method of hot bluing.\nAs the rough pattern of the jaws were in pretty good condition I decided to restore them. After a night in the rust remover and a bit of wire brushing the jaws already looked pretty good. I also had to bend them as they were a bit out of shape. As they're just case hardened this worked very well. Then I sanded all the surfaces clean, chamfered all edges and applied cold bluing to darken them.\nIn the end I'm very happy how this little bench vise has turned out. In my opinion the red looks very nice together with the black steel parts and the shiny sanded surfaces and the white details of the lettering are just the cherry on top.\n\nI hope you like my work and the video. \n\nLink to the vise opener tool video:\nhttps://youtu.be/VXvMa_n3zls\n\nHuge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and especially to:\n\nAdel AlSaffar\nAlex McGeorge\nAlfonso Baz\nAlistair Moor\nAmar.k\nAnthony Eufemio\nArron Metcalf\nBendurion\nBrenna Redpath\nChris walter\nDavid Barker\nEdward Conway\nEmbiss\nHaitham Al Zir\nisaac\njames lowe\nJean Ceppi\nJohn Shebanow\nJoseph Kamps\nJosh Ledford\nJosh Wasserman\nJoshua Bentley\nJoshua Scher\nKar Marsten\nKerem Yollu\nLambda GPU Workstations\nLordPi\nMellissa Marcus\nMonte Gibbs\nNoLoneSurvivor\nPat Thrasher\nPeter Riddett\npotokslow\nRobert Brindley\nSophieHDLM\nSteve Bothe\nStevenVR\nTyler Carruth\nVaushVidya\nVickie Bligh\nVince Valenti\nWill Black\nXavier Carbel\nYale Baker\nYuri Zapuchlak\nAdam Holtzclaw\nAlex Findlay\nAlipasha Sadri\nAndrew Phillips\nArni Bjorgvinsson\nBenjamin Gouveia\nbizzaropanda\nBonnie Williamson\nBrett Pitts\nBrian Hoerl\nChad Bryant\nCharles Copenhaver\nCrystal Cash\nDamien Fuller-Sutherland\nDaniel Trejo\nDaniel Varga\nDave Hardware\nDavid Ebert\nDavid P Hruska\nDavid Powell\nGrant Daniel\nHaley McFadden\nHard_Boiled\nJack Curry\njake meckley\nJason Koi\nJeff Smith\nJeremy Cole\nJohan Vergeer\nJoël Franusic\nJustin Blackwood\nKen Rosso\nKevin Robinson\nKurt Gazow\nL Rlta\nLina Machina\nMarc Cerisier\nMarc Staedelin\nMary Casella\nMellissa McConnell\nMicheal Bier\nMichael Lamp\nMossy_Forrest\nPeter Cyprian\nPeter Read\nRebecca Miller\nRegis Vincent\nRob\nRobert Galyen\nSarah Langlais\nScott Marshall\nStefan Kronander\nSteven Michalcewicz\nSuiros\nSvenja Kuckla\nThanny\nTim Holt\nTom Wallace\nTrevor Kam\nTucker Ifft\nVictoria Emmenegger\nWilliam\n\n\nMy camera:\nPanasonic HC-VX11\n\n\nIf you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

{"description":"Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 | The Bloody Lie (2022)\n\nFor more than a decade Elizabeth Holmes spun a despicable bloody lie. She told the world she’d invented a medical miracle. It was a machine which, with a tiny drop of blood, could almost instantly diagnose myriad diseases. Holmes promised to revolutionise healthcare, and in doing so fooled many wealthy investors. It led to her becoming a darling of Silicon Valley and an inspirational billionaire. But when whistle-blowers started questioning her claims, Holmes’ fairytale, along with her company Theranos, was destroyed. Earlier this year, Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty of fraud. Now it’s judgement day as she discovers her punishment.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #BloxFruits","title":"Race V4 Official Guide  | Blox Fruits (Part 1)","duration":178,"channel_id":"UCH-hRvGG-A2zQDDPF-kIDpA","author":"Axiore","date":"20221122","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7eoNh23Jew","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A7eoNh23Jew/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":428230}}

{"description":"Edited by: SimplyAJ (http://youtube.com/SimplyAJ)\n\nComplete Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtzT_jAav1xg5QU5A46bAtuJEV6b0KPUV\n\n-Rules and Explanations-\nRules: (1) Only use the one Pokémon in Battle, others for HMs are fine. (2) No Items in battle (3) No Glitches* (4) Set Mode (5) No saving in the Elite Four (6) No evasion moves\n\n*Badge Boost \"Glitch\" Explanation: When you collect odd numbered badges the game boosts a stat by 12.5%. Brock gives ATK, Surge DEF, Koga SPE, and Blaine SPC (in game text is wrong). When any of your stats are modified (even by you using a move like Withdraw, or your opponent using Leer) the badge boosts are re-applied. So If you use Swords Dance, you also gain *an additional* 12.5% in Speed/Defence/Special (on top of the 12.5% you were supposed to be getting). When you level up, the game corrects this error, and only the non-glitch 12.5% remains. Because of how difficult it is to avoid, I've allowed for it to be exploited, since opponents will spam Leer/Growl anyways, and this way battles are less random.
