Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso\n\nIn this third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them as last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the ‚Äúwonder kid,‚Äù has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate‚Äôs contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.\n\nSong: ‚ÄúI Still Believe‚Äù by Frank Turner https://apple.co/IStillBelieve_FrankTurner \n\nAudio Description Version available: https://apple.co/TedLasso-\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Ted Lasso:\nhttps://twitter.com/TedLasso\n\nFollow AFC Richmond:\nhttps://twitter.com/AFCRichmond\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple TV+\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTVPlus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTVPlus\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

{"description":"On June 16, worlds collide. Watch the official trailer now for The Flash ‚Äì only in theaters. #TheFlashMovie \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù directed by Andy Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero‚Äôs first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in ‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian‚Ä¶ albeit not the one he‚Äôs looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry‚Äôs only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (‚ÄúBullet Train,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äù), Ron Livingston (‚ÄúLoudermilk,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù), Maribel Verd√∫ (‚ÄúElite,‚Äù ‚ÄúY tu mam√° tambi√©n‚Äù), Kiersey Clemons (‚ÄúZack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League,‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetheart‚Äù), Antje Traue (‚ÄúKing of Ravens,‚Äù ‚ÄúMan of Steel‚Äù) and Michael Keaton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù) and Michael Disco (‚ÄúRampage,‚Äù ‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù).

The executive producers \nare Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Suicide Squad‚Äù), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (‚ÄúIT Chapter Two,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù), editors Jason Ballantine (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù) and Paul Machliss (‚ÄúThe Gentlemen,‚Äù ‚ÄúBaby Driver‚Äù), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (‚ÄúDoctor Strange,‚Äù ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äù); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch \n(‚ÄúThe Invisible Man,‚Äù the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films).\n\nWarner Bros.

{"description":"The end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema‚Äôs most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they‚Äôve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who‚Äôs fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything‚Äîand everyone‚Äîthat Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011‚Äôs Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn‚Äôt know was that Reyes‚Äô son, Dante (Aquaman‚Äôs Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante‚Äôs plot will scatter Dom‚Äôs family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante‚Äôs vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar¬Æ winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn‚Äôt hold the same fondness for Dom‚Äôs crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom‚Äôs past; and legendary Oscar¬Æ winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia‚Äôs Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga\n\n#FASTX","title":"FAST X | Official Trailer","duration":222,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32RAq6JzY-w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32RAq6JzY-w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":32989955}}
