After seeing \"Slave For You,\" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, \"Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.\"\n\nProd Co: UnderWonder Content\nProducers: Robert Katz, Frank Borin, Ivana Borin \nDirector: Tanu Muino\n\nWatch more Elton videos: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WatchMore\nSubscribe to Elton channel: http://bit.ly/EltonYTSubscribe \n\nFollow Elton John on...\nFacebook: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/facebookYT \nTwitter: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/twitterYT \nInstagram: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/instaYT \nOfficial Website: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WebsiteOfficial \nJoin the Rocket Club newsletter: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/RocketClub \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/EltonJohn","title":"Elton John, Britney Spears - Hold Me Closer (Official Video)","duration":205,"channel_id":"UCI8Ry7NdFNLel-S8dWU7mDA","author":"EltonJohnVEVO","date":"20220927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qExVlz3zb0k","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/hqdefault.jpg?v=6332f93b","content":{"View count":831278}}

This time we've got The Aristocats (Duchess and O'Malley), Hercules (Hercules and Meg), Mulan (Mulan and Shang), The Princess and the Frog (Tiana and Naveen), and Tarzan (Tarzan and Jane) to see which couples might be headed for tough times ahead, and which seem to be on pretty good footing to get to happily ever after.

{"description":"The final five-and-a-half minutes of images leading up to the DART spacecraft’s intentional collision with asteroid Dimorphos. The DART spacecraft streamed these images from its DRACO camera back to Earth in real time as it approached the asteroid. \n\nThis replay movie is 10 times faster than reality, except for the last six images, which are shown at the same rate that the spacecraft returned them. Both Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos are visible at the start of the movie.  At the end, Dimorphos fills the field of view. The final image in the movie shows a patch of Dimorphos that is 51 feet 16 meters) across. \n\nDART’s impact occurred during transmission of the final image to Earth, resulting in a partial picture at the end of this movie. Didymos is roughly 2,500 feet (780 meters) in diameter; Dimorphos is about 525 feet (160 meters) in length.

A player’s creativity and ingenuity are the key to thriving on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\nReshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\n\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain!\nSurvive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\n\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to the mysterious core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\nSnap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\n\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can all be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\nPlay with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\n\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox.\nDiscover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system.\n\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.","title":"I Broke Astroneer in Half Using Dynamite and Trains","duration":1034,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220925","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkDfIclJoHA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HkDfIclJoHA/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2109515}}

Twice in a month our road has been completely washed out. This has halted progress on the American Hotel and everything else. It's been a very trying time, but if I've learned anything in the past 2 years or so, it's that the only way forward is through. So we got back after it and went about fixing the road, once again. \n\nAlong the way, I took two side trips that really inspired me and helped keep everything in perspective. I visited the graves of the 1872 Earthquake victims as well as the Burro Schmidt Tunnel. Both really helped me this week as all this was happening. The stories for both are really interesting and I hope you took as much away from them as I did. \n\nMore photos and video of Burro Schmidt here: https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/\n\nCerro Gordo T-Shirts and more: https://store.cerrogordomines.com/\n\nMailing Address: PO Box 490, Lone Pine, CA 93545\n\nThank you all so much for the ongoing support for this town and the project.

Filled with easter eggs, new characters and a lot of things that alter what happens in the books we're here to explain it all. Set before the days of the Maury show we unfortunately can't carry out a DNA test but we all know who the father is of Rhaenyras kids. Harwin Strong has only briefly appeared in the series so far and he was spotted briefly at Aegons second born day as well as in the streets of Kings Landing and now my mans gone from a knight in the streets to a night in the sheets.\n\nNow the book shouldn't be taken as gospel and though I'll talk about what happens in it, it is important to bear in mind that there are lots of second hand accounts that have been compiled by Maesters. They all differ over who took Rhaenyras Maidenhead with some saying that Daemon did it, Criston was the one and Harwin is also mentioned as well.\n\nHarwin was known as Harwin Breakbones, the strongest man in Westeros and also the heir to Harranhaal which we saw in the prologue of episode 1.\n\nIt's said Criston rejected her at one point and she ran off into the night which is where she bumped into Harwin who ended up being the one who did the deed. In the source material the pair got it on and this burned Criston who ended up becoming bitter about it. Though he knocked Rhaeynra back he was deeply in love with her and he ended up unleashing this anger at the tournaments at the wedding.","title":"HOUSE OF THE DRAGON Episode 6 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Of Thrones Easter Eggs","duration":1532,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20220926","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Veg4RXgSjVk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Veg4RXgSjVk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":567477}}

Http://youtube.com/corridorcast\n\nTHIS EPISODE ► As Ai image generation takes the art world by storm, Niko sits down to see if he can harness its power and create the first-ever narrative story illustrated entirely by a computer.\n\nA message from Niko ► Hi there! If you’re reading this far, it’s probably because you want to learn more about this technology, and possibly want to run it yourself.\n\nThe easiest and simplest way to try Stable Diffusion is through their official online tool, Dream Studio - https://beta.dreamstudio.ai\n\nNow, if you want to get in on the open source movement, you can have this up and running on most modern PCs for free. However, if you’ve never worked with open source projects before, there is a learning curve to get started. Don’t worry! With a little focused time you’ll be up and running, and there are many of us online ready to help.\n\nThe two communities I recommend starting with:\nOfficial Stable Diffusion Discord - https://discord.gg/stablediffusion\nr/StableDiffusion - http://reddit.com/r/stablediffusion\n\nYou got questions? Start there!\n\nAt the studio we’re currently running AUTOMATIC1111’s version of Stable Diffusion. If you want to install it, here’s a guide: https://stablediffusionguides.carrd.co/#one\n\nCheck out the other guides on that site as well, for other ways to run Stable Diff. You can even run it on the could!\n\nAs for Dreambooth… you’re gonna need access to some serious hardware to run it. In time I’m sure this will change, but at this moment it is very challenging. Be forewarned!\n\nHere is the official project from Google: https://dreambooth.github.io\n\nAnd this is the implementation in Stable Diffusion I recommend you try: https://github.com/JoePenna/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion\n\nI’ll be honest with you- I am no ML scientist, and I can’t break down in detail how the code works. This is raw experimental stuff, and frankly most of us have no idea what we’re doing. But we’re chipping away at it! I recommend stopping by this specific discord thread if you wanna help out: https://discord.gg/thwu44bc\n\nAnd finally, all of this is possible right now because of open sharing of knowledge and collaboration. Keep this spirit alive and share!

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n00:00 Viewer discretion is advised: the rules\n00:53 searching for trash gems\n02:50 Item #1\n03:33 choosing a shelter location\n03:53 building a fire pit\n05:06 item #2\n07:08 item #3\n07:38 making a fire\n08:43 best vpn ;)\n09:54 item #4\n10:58 water purification system\n12:15 item #5….re-do ;)\n13:05 building shelter\n\n14:40 item #6\n15:42 eating dry cake mix…\n17:32 making a natural pillow\n18:46 item #7\n19:58 item #8\n21:29 making tools out of clay\n22:37 item #9\n25:00 making a CAKE\n26:25 item #10 - last one\n27:41 the pasta dance\n32:05 the clay pot WORKED\n33:42 sleeping with bears…\n35:00 midnight check in….NOT GOOD\n35:40 2 am, Eamon is DONE\n37:08 TBC: pt. 2 is on Eamon and Bec’s channel!\n\n\n#survivor #bushcraft #travel #travelvlog","title":"48 HOUR SURVIVAL (starting with nothing)","duration":2258,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220925","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z78Pza15RYU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z78Pza15RYU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":779986}}

{"description":"In this video I'm restoring a pair of antique German headphones. I've found these headphones at an online auction for $30 and I thought they look pretty cool for a restoration project.\nUnfortunately they didn't work anymore. I measured the coils and three of the four were broken. That fact put this little project to a whole new challenge. It required a ton of research to completely understanding every single detail of its function to remake the coils and such. After some trial and error I managed to remake the broken bobbins and rewind the coils. The tricky part was that both  coils are connected with eachother at the beginning of the windings in the core. I had to make a special jig, so I could clamp both coils when winding the second one.\nThe original paint had some kind of a structure in it. It was black matte with some kind of a hammertone pattern. Unfortunately I was not able to find such paint, so I went with regular black matte. To not loose the were fine writings and logo I only applied a very thin layer of primer and coat.\nThe Bakelite pieces just required some wet sanding and a good polish and they looked like new again. Old Bakelite might contain asbestos, that's why I wet sanded them so there won't be any sanding dust.\nI cleaned the membranes with scotch brite after a 24h bath in rust remover. To get rid of the pitting I sanded it with 240 grit sandpaper. I was already down to 0.13mm from 0.2mm thickness, but there was still pitting visible and I just sanded one side. To get the best possible sound at the end I decided to remake both membranes with new 0.2mm steel foil. To match the original membranes I also painted the center black matte.\nI nickel plated all the screws and the two brackets like they were originally. The brackets were a little bit weird, because they were two identical ones instead of pair of mirrored ones. I fixed that pretty easy by just bending the shaft on one ion the opposite direction.\nI was very lucky that the cable was in nearly perfect condition. It had absolutely no visible damge or fraying, just lost a bit of color. I just had to shorten them. Todays headphones all work with AC, these however back then worked with DC. Therefore the polarity matters. I also marked all endings of the cable with red and black threads, so did I made a red and black plastic cover for the plugs. \nIn the end I'm very happy how these headphones have turned out. The color combination of the black matte with the shiny black Backelite parts look very classy together with the shiny nickel plated parts and the crispy clean looking knurling is the cherry on top.\n\nI hope you like my work and the video.\n\nHuge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and especially to:\nAdel AlSaffar\nAlex McGeorge\nAlfonso Baz\nAlistair Moor\nAmar.k\nAnthony Eufemio\nArron Metcalf\nArthur\nBendurion\nBrenna Redpath\nChris walter\nDavid Barker\nEdward Conway\nEmbiss\nHaitham Al Zir\nisaac\njames lowe\nJean Ceppi\nJohn Shebanow\nJosh Denny\nJosh Ledford\nJosh Wasserman\nJoshua Bentley\nJoshua Scher\nKar Marsten\nLambda GPU Workstations\nLordPi\nMellissa Marcus\nMonte Gibbs\nNathaniel Carver\nNoLoneSurvivor\nPat Thrasher\nPeter Riddett\npotokslow\nSophieHDLM\nSteve Bothe\nStevenVR\nTyler Carruth\nVaushVidya\nVickie Bligh\nVince Valenti\nWill Black\nXavier Carbel\nYale Baker\nYuri Zapuchlak\nAdam Holtzclaw\nAlipasha Sadri\nAndrew Egerton\nAndrew Phillips\nArni Bjorgvinsson\nBonnie Williamson\nBrian Hoerl\nChad Bryant\nCharles Copenhaver\nCrystal Cash\nDamien Fuller-Sutherland\nDaniel Trejo\nDaniel Varga\nDave Hardware\nDavid Ebert\nDavid P Hruska\nDavid Powell\nEndless Mike\nGrant Daniel\nHaley McFadden\nHard_Boiled\nJack Curry\njake meckley\nJason Koi\nJeff Smith\nJeremy Cole\nJohan Vergeer\nJoël Franusic\nKen Rosso\nKevin Robinson\nKurt Gazow\nL Rlta\nLiam Rafle\nLina Machina\nMarc Cerisier\nMarc Staedelin\nMary Casella\nMellissa McConnell\nMicheal Bier\nMichael Lamp\nMossy_Forrest\nNik\nPasacal Schmikal\nPeter Cyprian\nRebecca Miller\nRegis Vincent\nRob\nRobert Galyen\nSarah Langlais\nScott Marshall\nStefan Kronander\nSteven Michalcewicz\nSuiros\nSvenja Kuckla\nThanny\nTim Holt\nTom Wallace\nTrevor Kam\nTucker Ifft\nVictoria Emmenegger\nWilliam\n\nMy camera:\nPanasonic HC-VX11\n\nIf you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.
