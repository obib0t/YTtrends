And since we've tackled both Lush and Whole Foods soaps now, whose soaps do you want to see us demolish next??? \n\nBig thank you to both Katie at Royalty Soaps & Anne-Marie at Bramble Berry for their expert opinions on our franken-soap!!

Throughout this video we're gonna be going through it all but if you enjoy the video make sure you hit the thumbs up button and subscribe you will for videos like this every day.\n\nWith that out the way, thanks for clicking this, now let's get into Ahsoka.\n\n-\n\nSo last week saw a Super Star Destroyer Hypedrive been brought to the eye of Sion in order to give Morgan Elsbeth a pathway to Thrawn. Based on the Jedi hyperdrive rings this would allow the nightsister to finally bring him back after he was taken away in the rebels finales.\n\nThough last week we thought Sion might be a reference to Darth Sion it's true meaning is probbaly more inline with the literary meaning which defines a mystical utopia. The word also shares similarities to the word Scion which means heir. Thraw was known as the heir to the empire showing that it's all connected.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"AHSOKA Episode 3 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Rebels Easter Eggs, Theories & Review","duration":1403,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdtH_F9InJw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdtH_F9InJw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":221307}}

We made a music video and uploaded it on my music channel, but I recorded other footage, and wanted to make a video that represents just the Minecraft side of things, and that was extra meaningful to my fans in particular.\n\nThis video is meant to represent what Techno & I were doing when we were invited by Mr Beast to duel for $100,000, and then a recreation of the duel itself. This was one of the most notable moments of my life. This is meant to help us remember Technoblade,  keep his legacy living on, while also contributing to charity.\n\nTechnodad helped make sure the duel captured the sportsmanship the original duel did. The rest was thought up and organized by me and friends, on our own budget to raise money for charity.\n\nI debated putting this on a different channel, but it felt at home here.

Renowned since their inception for electrifying performances, The Rose quickly became one of Korea's most sought-after groups delivering a series of critically acclaimed albums that resonated with fans worldwide. In 2019, three of the band members temporarily went on hiatus to fulfill their mandatory military service obligations, during which Woosung pursued a successful solo career, releasing captivating albums and embarking on sold-out world tours.\n\nIn a moment of sheer joy for their devoted fans, The Rose reunited during one of Woosung's performances in South Korea in 2022. This reunion paved the way for their first full-length album HEAL, which was inspired by the transformative power of music and the stories shared by both their fans and themselves. HEAL soared to #4 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, while their accompanying HEAL Together World Tour drew an overwhelming crowd of over 90,000 attendees.\n\nNow, with their highly anticipated second full-length album DUAL, The Rose takes their music to new heights. Building upon the emotional honesty and vulnerability showcased in HEAL, this latest offering explores the profound concept of 'balance.' Seamlessly merging light and dark elements, The Rose masterfully weaves emotions and sounds, capturing the dualistic essence that defines their music.","title":"The Rose (더로즈) – You're Beautiful | Official Video","duration":249,"channel_id":"UClcbcYLmTpDeuK1EFeqh5uA","author":"The Rose","date":"20230825","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IFJQRlcNQ0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7IFJQRlcNQ0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3121305}}
