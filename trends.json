{"description":"British colonizers created a massive canal system in Pakistan — and helped cause the country’s deadly water crisis.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn late summer of 2022, Pakistan experienced a devastating flooding event. An unusually severe monsoon season induced by climate change resulted in a third of the country being covered with water. Over 1,600 lives were lost, and water took months to drain out of lower-lying regions of the country, causing disease and displacement. \n\nOn the flip side, Pakistan is among the most water-scarce countries in the world — expected to reach absolute water scarcity by 2025 if nothing changes. You can’t remove climate change from this equation, but an overlooked factor is the role that British engineering played in building water infrastructure along the Indus River and its tributaries, Pakistan’s sole source of surface water. \n\nA series of perennial canals, dam-like structures called barrages, and embankments were built to extract as much water from the Indus as possible and convert much of Pakistan’s arid landscape into farmland. But this water infrastructure exacerbates the destruction of flooding events and creates a hierarchical system along the canals in terms of water access. \n\nIn our video, we explain the design of this water infrastructure and how Pakistan’s colonial past has made the country’s relationship with water even more precarious. \n\nDaanish Mustafa, who we interviewed for this video, co-authored a report on Pakistan’s water crisis: \nhttps://www.usip.org/publications/2017/04/contested-waters-subnational-scale-water-conflict-pakistan\n\nWe recommend The Juggernaut’s reporting on the legacy of dams in Pakistan: \nhttps://www.thejuggernaut.com/pakistan-floods-dams-british-raj-colonialism\n\nFor more context on how Pakistan bears the brunt of the effects of climate change: \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/10/pakistan-flood-cop27-climate-change/671664/\n\nWe interview David Gilmartin for this story, who authored a book on the history of water engineering in the Indus basin: \nhttps://bookshop.org/p/books/blood-and-water-the-indus-river-basin-in-modern-history-david-gilmartin/6562597?ean=9780520355538\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Whereas the last two weeks have had us following the footsteps of Joel and Ellie, this one takes a big detour. Not only do we focus on Bill and Franks relationship but they also massively alter the way that things happen in the game.\n\nNow the first thing I wanna do is go through Bills story in the playstation classic for everyone who hasn't played it, just so that they can get an idea of how much things were changed and what we originally had the first time round. As always we will be saving future spoilers for the end of the video and if you enjoy it then please hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe for breakdowns like this every day. With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now lets get into The Last Of Us Episode 3.\n\n-\n\nNow in the game you arrive in Lincoln having just escaped the state building. This culminated in Tess' death and Joel and Ellie fled into a subway station after being chased by Fedra agents. You never really got to catch your breath and on the other side of this when you did slow down Joel refused to talk about Tess. This showed how cold he was and even upon reaching Bill you just played along that she was alive without ever correcting him when he asked about her.\n\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 3 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":2193,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230130","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAePlZC0sfc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZAePlZC0sfc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":430772}}

According to Google, it's living without the reliance of one or more public utilities. But the truth is much harder than that, and we discuss the biggest obstacle (and a totally unexpected one) at the end of this video. It's truly one of those things you can't fully appreciate until you've been there, but we're doing our best to share our knowledge and experience with you! And speaking of, this week we dealt with the reality of solar panels in the snow--lots of scraping! Not just our panels, but our walkway with our snow plow, which had a flat tire. You too can have fun surprises like this when living off the grid! We took our ATVs 4km (2.5 miles) down to pick up our Amazon packages, and had to get some supplies just in time for some real winter weather. Thankfully our propane stove still works when we have reduced solar charging due to snow. Were you expecting the reveal at the end of the video? What do you think would be most challenging about living off the grid?

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n00:00 the Winter Whales of Norway\n01:54 Day 1: ship tour\n06:36 Day 2: finding humpback whales\n11:56 Day 3: SWIMMING WITH ORCAS\n18:19 Day 4: breaching whales\n21:13 Day 5: Swimming with orcas\n25:06 Polar plunge in the Arctic\n28:07 Bloops :)","title":"Swimming with Wild Orcas in Norway (incredible encounters)","duration":1826,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20230128","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb03_fw4VmI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tb03_fw4VmI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":578287}}

Complete with commentary from Ryan George who is now several years older!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g\n\nJames Cameron’s Avatar took the world by storm in 2009, securing its spot as one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Isn’t it kind of weird then that it barely seems to have had any impact on pop culture? To find out why that is, let’s step inside the pitch meeting that led to the world of Pandora, the Na’vi, and a whooooole lot of thinly veiled racial stereotypes. What led to the decision to have giant blue kitty kats? Why don’t the multimillion dollar Avatars have ANY tracking capabilities? What’s up with the super generic villain? All these questions and more are answering in this pitch meeting!
