{"description":"Just in time for Valentine’s Day comes the third installment of the \nblockbuster “Magic Mike” film franchise, the musical comedy “Magic Mike’s Last \nDance.” The creative team behind the first film, which garnered praise from critics \nand audiences alike, has reunited to create the magic again: Channing Tatum \nreprises his role as Mike Lane and Steven Soderbergh returns to the helm with a \nscript from Reid Carolin, who also wrote the first two films. And starring alongside \nTatum is Salma Hayek Pinault (“House of Gucci,” “Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard”).\n“Magic” Mike Lane (Tatum) takes to the stage again after a lengthy hiatus, \nfollowing a business deal that went bust, leaving him broke and taking \nbartender gigs in Florida. For what he hopes will be one last hurrah, Mike heads \nto London with a wealthy socialite (Hayek Pinault) who lures him with an offer he \ncan’t refuse…and an agenda all her own. With everything on the line, once Mike \ndiscovers what she truly has in mind, will he—and the roster of hot new dancers \nhe’ll have to whip into shape—be able to pull it off?\nThe film’s producers are Nick Wechsler, Gregory Jacobs, Tatum, Carolin and \nPeter Kiernan. Julie M. Anderson serves as executive producer.\nAlso starring with Tatum and Hayek Pinault are Ayub Khan Din (“Ackley \nBridge”), newcomer Jemelia George, Juliette Motamed (“We Are Lady Parts”) \nand Vicki Pepperdine (“Johnny English Strikes Again”).\nSoderbergh’s creative team behind the scenes includes production \ndesigner Pat Campbell (“The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself”), costume designer \nChristopher Peterson (“The Irishman”) and music supervisor Season Kent (“KIMI,” \n“Let Them All Talk”), with choreography by Alison Faulk and Luke Broadlick, both \npart of the “Magic Mike” franchise.\nA Warner Bros. Pictures Presentation, “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” slides into \ntheaters only in North America on February 10, 2023 and internationally beginning \n8 February 2023, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎\n\n00:00 Stairway to Heaven, explained\n00:49 Are we prepared for this?\n02:36 Our first solo via ferrata\n08:36 We love Public Lands!\n09:59 Overnight in the mountain hut\n14:20 Emotional morning of the climb\n16:54 HERE WE GO\n20:48 THE LADDER\n29:52 BLOOPS","title":"WE CLIMBED THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS LADDER (2,000 Foot Drop)","duration":1858,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20221112","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cw2zzop8-A","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2Cw2zzop8-A/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":786985}}

{"description":"Karlous Bernard Miller is an American comedian, actor and rapper. He began his comedy career in Atlanta, Georgia and is widely known for his successful podcast/comedy tour The 85 South show, along with being a cast member on MTV's comedy improv series, Wild 'n Out, and his notorious \"Wildstyle\" battles with fellow cast members DC Young Fly and Chico Bean.\n\n\nIn this interview Marco greets Karlous and Karlous is immediately apprehensive of Marco and let’s Marco know. Marco starts with a softball question, “Who is Karlous Miller?”  Marco expounds upon Karlous’s answer and reveals that the production team found out that Karlous is big on relationships. The production team claims to know Karlous’s baby mama and takes out his phone and proves it. Karlous immediately changes his mood as the atmosphere tenses. Marco redirects the questions to women’s body parts and Karlous gives his opinions. The production team continues to make noise in the background. Marco goes into “fact or cap” and Karlous reveals he hears old people in his head. Marco is interrupted by the crew who are ignorant to who the guest is. Marco has an impromptu meeting with his staff as he is frustrated with the line of questions. Marco asks about Karlous being a Donald Trump supporter and the staff takes exception as they try to prove to Karlous and Marco that there are facts. Karlous watches as the staff and Marco argue on the set.  A staff member exits as Marco chases him and all hell breaks loose as other staff bring a monkey on set and Karlous reacts. Marco and the producer argue off set and Karlous is astonished at the monkey and hysteria. Karlous talks to one of the staff members and is baffled at the unprofessional antics and a monkey being put on his lap. The staff brings out another monkey and things get hairy. Marco attempts to reset and interview Karlous but Karlous is not in the mood. Marco is told by the producer he needs to reset and Marco is not hearing it. Marco tries to end the interview by getting a drop but that goes left as well. The staff continues to try and get it together as things go completely downhill…\n\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries  IG @therealdavemays @igobybrettj\n\n\nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n\n\nDirector: Matt Ables IG @mattablespromotions\n\n\nDirector of Photography: Militant Guerilla Productions\n\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n\n\nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco\n\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Karlous Miller Talks 85 South, Comedy, Rap, Donald Trump, Real Prank + More","duration":1208,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20221109","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPUVKiLpmS0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uPUVKiLpmS0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":715095}}

Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable: Shooting nuclear waste into space. It is one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with nuclear energy. But it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it. \n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Prodcuts designed with ❤ https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3uC1UdP\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3rafoeA\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nIvo Casant, 서현지, Terrence Hamm, Caitlyn, Saeris Sanoora, k-gregory, ADesertCottontail, Tiffany Cale, Ian Pendleton, Samuel Ginty, Catriona Mullan, 범석 고, Alexander Stadnyk, Andrei Albu, Tk AH, Sherry Schuderer, Florian Haydn, jack ruppel, James B, oshra duek, Lorraine Inez Lil, Vinicius Krischke, Josh Evans, Yuri Ibraev, เมธาสิทธิ์ มงคลปัญญาเลิศ, Peter G, T G , Patches, Alice Archer, Paul Faber, Donivan, Call, Antzela Giovani, Mischa Hamby\n\nChapters\n00:00:00 12,023 Calender Announcement\n00:00:20 INTRO\n00:00:57 What is nuclear waste?\n00:02:47 Problem 1: Stuff Ain't Cheap\n00:04:24 Problem 2: Space is hard\n00:06:53 Problem 3: Rockets go Brrrrrrrr\n00:08:06 Conclusion and Opinion Part\n00:09:39 Endcard","title":"Why Don't We Shoot Nuclear Waste Into Space?","duration":655,"channel_id":"UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q","author":"Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell","date":"20221108","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us2Z-WC9rao","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Us2Z-WC9rao/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":5677484}}
