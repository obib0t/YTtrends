{"description":"Dwayne Johnson revealed in message from Hawaii that a live-action reimagining of Disney Animation’s 2016 hit feature film “Moana” is in development.\n \nThe new feature film is produced by Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia via their Seven Bucks Productions, and Beau Flynn via Flynn Picture Co. Executive producers include Auli‘i Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the 2016 film, and Scott Sheldon of Flynn Picture Co. Jared Bush and Samoan industry pro Dana Ledoux Miller will also take part in the production. Bush, who was a director and co-writer of Disney’s Oscar®-winning feature “Encanto” and a writer and co-director on Disney’s Oscar®-winning film “Zootopia,” wrote the screenplay for 2016’s “Moana.”\n \nLike its animated predecessor, the film will celebrate the islands, communities and traditions of Pacific Islanders as seen through the eyes of a young woman eager to pave her own path. Moana’s journey of self-discovery and reflection on the lives of her ancestors won hearts worldwide, as did her newfound friendship with an exiled demigod named Maui. \n \nJohnson, who plans to return to the fictional world to set sail with Moana, said, “I’m deeply humbled and overcome with gratitude to bring the beautiful story of Moana to the live action big screen. This story is my culture, and this story is emblematic of our people’s grace and warrior strength. I wear this culture proudly on my skin and in my soul, and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reunite with Maui, inspired by the mana and spirit of my late grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia, is one that runs very deep for me. I want to thank my partners at Disney for their strong commitment to this special endeavor, because there is no better world for us to honor the story of our people, our passion and our purpose than through the realm of music and dance, which is at the core of who we are as Polynesian people.”\n \nNative Hawaiian actor Cravalho, who helped shape Moana in the original film, said the beloved protagonist’s reach is sweeping. “She has had such a profound impact on how we think of Disney princesses,” she said. “Moana’s strength and perseverance are inspiring—to audiences around the world, to me and to everyone who helped bring her to life. I’m looking forward to sharing her story in a whole new way.”\n \nSean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production (Disney Live Action), said the film would join a successful lineup of live-action adaptations that include 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast,” 2019’s “Aladdin” and the highly anticipated live-action version of “The Little Mermaid,” opening May 26. “It’s still early, but the idea of working with these fantastic partners to tell such a meaningful story on a live-action canvas, particularly as we celebrate 100 years of storytelling at Disney, is thrilling,”said Bailey.\n \nWalt Disney Animation Studios’ “Moana” debuted in theaters on Nov. 23, 2016, grossing nearly $644 million in global box office. The title, which debuted on Disney+ with the streamer’s 2019 launch, is among the top 15 movies streamed in the United States in 2022. The film’s soundtrack, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Opetaia Foa’iand Mark Mancina, was lauded worldwide. Miranda won a GRAMMY® for best song written for visual media (“How Far I’ll Go”), and an Oscar® nomination for best achievement in music written for motion pictures – original song (“How Far I’ll Go”). In 2021, the “Moana” soundtrack broke a Billboard Soundtrack chart record for the amount of time spent at number one (52 weeks). Additionally, the film was nominated for an Academy Award (best animated feature film of the year), a BAFTA (best animated feature film) and a pair of Golden Globes® (best motion picture – animated and best original song (“How Far I’ll Go”).","title":"Live-Action Moana Announcement","duration":128,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20230403","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHXB-5woeHw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHXB-5woeHw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":303710}}

{"description":"This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World... this has never been done before.\n\nThis was one of the most incredible projects I have ever worked on.\n\nTwitter: @Dream\nInstagram: @DreamWasTaken\nSnapchat: @Dream\n\nIn this video, we coded a Minecraft mod that live translates languages through a voice chat above your character in Minecraft. It has fairly good accuracy and can translate most languages around the world. This mod allows you to play Minecraft, make jokes, and have fun with people that can't even speak your language.  \n\nLive voice translation has been being worked on by Google and other companies, and they provide API's for it.  Google glass , apple glasses, and other similar products have been talked about for years with mentions of live-translating interactions in real life. We thought about taking that, and applying it to gaming.\n\nI truly believe that this is the near future for all online games with voice chat, with being able to play and communicate with anyone from anywhere, breaking down the language barrier. I also believe that this is a cool glimpse into the future in real life. If a bunch of kids can do it at home in one of the biggest games in the world, a bunch of engineers and geniuses can make it happen in real life.\n\nIn this video there were plenty of languages, and I was able to laugh and joke with all of them. When testing this mod, I played with friends of mine that spoke different languages, and we were having so much fun playing together and laughing about how crazy it was that we could communicate with each other.\n\nThis has been being worked on for a while and I'm so happy to finally share it with everyone. There are some bugs still, and in this version a couple of the notable bugs were: Minecraft words being incorrectly translated, names being incorrectly translated, and your last word not showing up sometimes.\n\nWhenever this mod's bugs are fixed and it's features are added, I plan on releasing this to the public for free, and with open source so anyone can make any additions they want with ease. Depending on what API is used for transcribing/translations and how many people are being translated, it can be costly, so although the mod will be free from me, using it might require setup on your end.\n\nI am releasing an SMP, the \"United SMP\", which is going to feature creators from all around the world. Equal representation from the languages that are on it, with a mock EU-style committee to make decisions so there is not one owner. This will be launching hopefully later this month, and has 60 creators to start with, 10 of which will be English speaking, 50 of which will be from 5 other languages. Most of these people are people I never would have been able to collaborate with, or make jokes with, or share with my fans, so I am so excited to share our community with the world. There will be more details on my twitter about this, and I will be live streaming the server in the future.\n\nthank you guys for watching and supporting the channel to make stuff like this possible.","title":"This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World...","duration":1518,"channel_id":"UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w","author":"Dream","date":"20230403","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BZIxt07UNU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BZIxt07UNU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2943456}}

{"description":"There's crazy, and then there's what @tavarish has gone and done! Freddy has bought the infamous flood damaged McLaren P1, and my goodness does he have his work cut out to bring this back to the road. Let's head over in his re-built 675LT to go check it out... Oh boy!\n\nI first visited Freddy when he had just bought the crash damaged 675LT, and in fact it had certainly seen better days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9kf5t5PWDA However, fast forward and it's had a total overhaul, been brough back to life, and has numerous totally unique features.\n\nObservant viewers will notice that unfortunately this 675LT has since rather blown up... to put it lightly. Hopefully it's easy enough to work out that this was filmed beforehand and held back to reveal the P1 once Freddy had taken the wraps off to the world! More about all of that on @tavarish's channel.\n\nHowever, today is all about the P1, the most infamous P1 in the world. The car that was destroyed by the hurricane in Florida last September, seem by millions in videos and images being battered around the owner's garage in flood water, sailing off down the street, and coming to a rest atop a toilet. Of course that was a devastating event and sadly many lost lives in the brutal weather, however it's Freddy's goal to get this car back on the road one day.\n\nWhen it comes to a rebuild project, it's safe to say that this must be the biggest undertaking ever seen in this space. Not only has the car been entirely submerged, but every body panel has taken a battering, and absolutely nothing works as it should. I have no idea how he's going to manage, but I can't wait to see it finished!\n\nA huge congratulations to Freddy on this massive brave pill he's swallowed, it's going to be quite the ride:\nhttp://youtube.com/tavarish\nhttp://instagram.com/therealtavarish\n\nIf you're interested in these kinds of rare and limited cars, be sure to check out Exclusive Car Registry where you can find this McLaren P1 here: https://exclusivecarregistry.com/details/mclaren/p1/1397\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Intro\n01:15 Walkaround of Freddy's 675LT\n05:50 675LT Drive\n15:41 Full Flood-damaged P1 Walkaround\n25:23 Dry Ice Cleaning Process\n26:14 Back to the McLaren P1\n28:09 Signing the P1 Engine Cover\n29:59 Final Thoughts\n30:48 Wrap Up\n\n#McLarenP1 #Tavarish #Wrecked\n\nWATCH NEXT:\n🍿 COMPLETE TOUR of My Car Collection! 2023; 13 Years of YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBAbD9PD24g\n🍿 RICHARD HAMMOND ROASTS MY Lambo!

{"description":"Tipping in the United States is on the rise and experts are calling it tipflation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the number of tips provided at full-service restaurants grew by 17% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Meanwhile the tip frequency at quick-service restaurants rose 16% during the same time period. Experts say that's because of the newer and sleeker-looking Point-of-Sale, or POS, systems by tech companies like Square, Toast and Clover, who also have increased their sales as a result. The pressure to tip well in front of the tip receiver, before a service is completed, or in front of other customers makes a difference for many. After customers swipe their credit card, they're typically prompted with three large tipping options on a screen. While businesses can opt out of the tipping feature, most aren't. In fact, even Starbucks started prompting customers for tips in stores in September 2022. With Americans being pressured to tip higher percentages and for more services, the question is, where is the tipping point?\n\nChapters: \n00:00 — Introduction \n02:25 — Why we tip \n04:09 — Tipping in 2023\n05:45 — Big Tech\n09:14 — Tipping point\n\nProduced by: Emily Lorsch\nEdited by: Jacob Harrell\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nGraphics by: Midnight Snacks\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.

{"description":"More than a year into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, signs continue to mount that Moscow is struggling under the weight of ballooning military spending. Moscow has consistently put on a brave face when it came to the country's economic health. But it's now classified or unlisted a third of the economic data coming out of the country. According to Russian Finance Ministery data unlisted or classified spending has doubled since last year, indicating around a third of the budget is likely connected to the war effort. 31 Billion dollars in total, dwarfing all other publicly listed government expenses. And Moscow's black budget is ballooning at a time of falling commodity prices, which make up the lion's share of Russia's earnings. Western sanctions also continue to bite according to Russia's president. \n\nAt the same time, publicly criticizing Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine can lead to harsh legal consequences. Most people prefer to voice their discontent in private. But one critical conversation between two prominent Russians has surfaced online.\n \nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#Russia #RussiaLeaks #Economy","title":"Ballooning 'black' budget and leaked conversations: Emerging cracks in Putin's Russia | DW News","duration":778,"channel_id":"UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg","author":"DW News","date":"20230330","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcHysuEJ9n8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wcHysuEJ9n8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1781074}}

{"description":"This Summer, meet the residents of Element City\n\nWatch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s #Elemental and see the movie in 3D, only in theaters June 16!\n\nCheck out a brand-new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental,” an all-new original feature film that transports moviegoers to an extraordinary place called Element City, where a host of elements live and work. The trailer showcases each element—air, earth, water and fire—and what sets them apart according to Ember, a quick-witted and fiery woman who’s always stayed close to home in Firetown. In “Elemental,” which opens in theaters on June 16, she finally ventures out of her comfort zone to explore this spectacular world born from the imaginations of Pixar’s filmmakers and specifically crafted for the big-screen experience. Element City is inspired by big cities around the globe and embraces theorized contributions from each elemental community—from giant pine-tree-like buildings and waterfall skyscrapers to a tornado-shaped arena called Cyclone Stadium. \n\nJoining the previously announced voice cast including Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as Ember and Wade, respectively, are Ronnie del Carmen as Ember’s soon-to-be retired dad, Bernie; Shila Ommi as Ember’s love-seeking mom, Cinder; Wendi McLendon-Covey as Wade’s stormy and Air-Ball-loving boss, Gale; Catherine O’Hara as Wade’s welcoming mom, Brook; Mason Wertheimer as Ember’s admiring earth neighbor, Clod; and Joe Pera as an overgrown city bureaucrat, Fern.\n \nDirected by Peter Sohn, produced by Denise Ream, p.g.a., and executive produced by Pete Docter, “Elemental” features a screenplay by John Hoberg & Kat Likkel and Brenda Hsueh with story by Sohn, Hoberg & Likkel and Hsueh. The film’s original score was composed and conducted by Thomas Newman. \n\r\nPixar Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixar/\r\nPixar Twitter: https://twitter.com/pixar\r\nPixar Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pixar\r\n \r\nCopyright: (C) Disney•Pixar","title":"Elemental | Official Trailer","duration":139,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20230328","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXzcyx9V0xw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hXzcyx9V0xw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":9463300}}
