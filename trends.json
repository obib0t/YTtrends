{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, ‚ÄúI am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth‚Äù\n‚Äî Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853‚Äì1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One¬Æ is the Presenting Sponsor of this year‚Äôs Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank‚Äôs three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center‚Äôs producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018. This year‚Äôs ceremony marks the 23rd year that the Kennedy Center‚Äôs marquee comedy award will be broadcast nationally.\n\nThe event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber.

The two become fast friends, but when Lyle‚Äôs existence is threatened by evil neighbor Mr. Grumps (Brett Gelman), the Primm‚Äôs must band together with Lyle‚Äôs charismatic owner, Hector P. Valenti (Javier Bardem), to show the world that family can come from the most unexpected places and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a big singing crocodile with an even bigger personality.\n\nLyle, Lyle, Crocodile will feature original songs performed by Shawn Mendes and written by the songwriting team behind The Greatest Showman, Benj Pasek & Justin Paul.

{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, ‚ÄúI am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth‚Äù\n‚Äî Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853‚Äì1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One¬Æ is the Presenting Sponsor of this year‚Äôs Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank‚Äôs three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center‚Äôs producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018. This year‚Äôs ceremony marks the 23rd year that the Kennedy Center‚Äôs marquee comedy award will be broadcast nationally.\n\nThe event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception in 1998.\n\n#TwainPrizePBS #JonStewart #SteveCarell\n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Steve Carell on Jon Stewart | 2022 Mark Twain Prize","duration":342,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20220622","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leN3PbNvi3c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/leN3PbNvi3c/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":484246}}

{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, ‚ÄúI am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth‚Äù\n‚Äî Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853‚Äì1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One¬Æ is the Presenting Sponsor of this year‚Äôs Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank‚Äôs three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center‚Äôs producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018. This year‚Äôs ceremony marks the 23rd year that the Kennedy Center‚Äôs marquee comedy award will be broadcast nationally.\n\nThe event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception in 1998.\n\n#TwainPrizePBS #JonStewart #StephenColbert\n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Stephen Colbert on Jon Stewart | 2022 Mark Twain Prize","duration":379,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20220622","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbGlemVZsLc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/VbGlemVZsLc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":375522}}

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe‚Äôve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we‚Äôre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat.

{"description":"This is a journey that spanned multiple days as a total of 150,496 unique players controlled a single game of Pok√©mon Crystal. So huge thanks to @DougDoug allowed me to recreate my favorite historical event: Twitch Plays Pok√©mon.\n\nEven though this adventure originally started as a race between the Twitch Chat communities of other great trainers (@PointCrow, @CONEY, @Grand POOBear, @Linkus7, @Stanz, @Failboat, and DougDoug himself), it became something so much larger. Genuinely my favorite experience I've ever had as a creator. This story takes place over multiple days alongside several mental breakdowns. It wasn't easy, but at least it was possible. One day, I hope to venture off to create Twitch Plays Pok√©mon once again... as we continue onwards through the Kanto region... eventually...\n\nAlso, a massive shoutout to @Jaiden Animations, @Birdee‚Äôs , and even @PointCrow for stopping by during the stream that refused to end. :)\n\n‚û§ MERCH: http://pleasebuymymerch.com\n‚û§ TWITTER: https://twitter.com/alpharad\n‚û§ INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/alpharad\n#alpharad #pokemon #twitch\n\nVIDEO EDITOR:\n‚û§ me :)\n\nTHUMBNAIL ART:\n‚û§ Bobber: https://twitter.com/BobberWCC\n\nTHUMBNAIL DESIGN: \n‚û§ Crystel: http://twitter.com/crystei","title":"Recreating Twitch Plays Pok√©mon","duration":2026,"channel_id":"UCBODyKF0JMbUd6D9Bklyzbw","author":"Alpharad","date":"20220617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGrcJC3gR4I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SGrcJC3gR4I/hqdefault.webp?v=62a8dc17","content":{"View count":1008465}}
