{"description":"The end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema‚Äôs most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they‚Äôve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who‚Äôs fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything‚Äîand everyone‚Äîthat Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011‚Äôs Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn‚Äôt know was that Reyes‚Äô son, Dante (Aquaman‚Äôs Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante‚Äôs plot will scatter Dom‚Äôs family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante‚Äôs vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar¬Æ winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn‚Äôt hold the same fondness for Dom‚Äôs crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom‚Äôs past; and legendary Oscar¬Æ winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia‚Äôs Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga\n\n#FASTX","title":"FAST X | Official Trailer","duration":222,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32RAq6JzY-w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32RAq6JzY-w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":10210342}}

{"description":"Knuckles the Echidna is struggling with the pressure of being the guy, the hero, the Sonic the Hedgehog replacement. He‚Äôs treating his friends like rubbish, because he‚Äôs scared. When it‚Äôs no longer Sonic AND Knuckles, and just Knux by himself‚Ä¶ well, it becomes Sonic vs Knuckles‚Ä¶ at least in the dreadlocked tough guy‚Äôs head.\n\nAt least Tails is here to try and give The Red Dude a bit of a pep talk. After all, what are friends for? And that pep talk is necessary, because there‚Äôs a massive Sonic boom coming in the form of a ginormous kaiju. So, unless Mr. Guardian can become Super Knuckles, and eliminate the Sonic prime threat, this civilisation is done for.

{"description":"From clothes to tech, why is everything so poorly made?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nMaybe you‚Äôve noticed: In the past 10 years everything we buy from clothes to technology has gotten just a little bit worse. Sweaters are more likely to tear. Phones are more likely to break. Smart toasters and TVs burn out and die after only a few years. It might seem like consumer products just aren‚Äôt built to last anymore. What‚Äôs going on?\n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately!), part of the problem is us. For decades, we‚Äôve been conditioned to buy, buy, buy, and today it‚Äôs normal for many consumers to shop for new clothes at least once a month. In order to keep up, many companies have to prioritize making things in the fastest and least expensive way possible. To do that, they cut corners with materials and labor. In turn, quality suffers, which leaves consumers with a lot of crappy things.\n\nThe story with technology is a little different. And the biggest difference is that while no one in fashion is saying you‚Äôre not allowed to sew a new button on a shirt, many tech companies have actually made it impossible to repair their products. \n\nThe good news is consumers have a surprising amount of control over this situation. Watch the video to learn more.\n\n\nCheck out the original article from Izzie Ramirez on Vox.com: https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23529587/consumer-goods-quality-fast-fashion-technology\n\nRepair.org is Gay Gordon Byrne‚Äôs association that‚Äôs fighting for your right to repair. \n\nFor more on the right to repair bill in New York State there are some articles here:\nhttps://www.engadget.com/new-york-right-to-repair-law-kathy-hochul-184654713.html\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2022/12/29/23530733/right-to-repair-law-new-york-tech-hochul-oems-parts\n\nWhile I didn‚Äôt spend much time on Fast Fashion for this piece, I did love these articles:\nhttps://catapult.co/stories/haley-e-d-houseman-clothing-costs-labor-materials-handmade-homemade-factory-made\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/fast-cheap-out-of-control-inside-rise-of-shein/\n\nThis article from Vogue did a great job breaking down what things actually costs:\nhttps://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-the-right-price-for-fashion\n\nI also highly recommend following Cora Harrington (@lingerie_addict) and Derek Guy (@dieworkwear) on twitter for more hot takes on the fashion industry. \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Rory McIlroy is making his first PGA TOUR start since winning THE CJ CUP in South Carolina in October. McIlroy has, however, played five times on the DP World Tour since that win, recording five top-5 finishes, including a win at the Hero Dubai Desert Classic. Eight of the world‚Äôs top-10 golfers are in the field, including world No. 2 Scottie Scheffler and world No. 3 Jon Rahm. Rahm currently leads in the FedExCup Standings and has won four of his last six starts combined on the PGA TOUR and DP World Tour. Meanwhile, Scheffler is looking to become the first golfer since Hideki Matsuyama (2016-17) to win back-to-back titles at TPC Scottsdale. Sam Ryder returns to TPC Scottsdale after making a hole-in-one on the famous 16th hole in 2022.

In Theaters June 9th.\n\nhttps://www.strays.movie/ \n\nThey say a dog is a man‚Äôs best friend, but what if the man is a total dirtbag? In that case, it might be time for some sweet revenge, doggy style. \n\nWhen Reggie (Will Ferrell), a na√Øve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte; The Last Man on Earth, Nebraska), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose. \n\nBut once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Oscar¬Æ winner Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is. \n \nDetermined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug‚Äôs pals‚ÄîMaggie (Isla Fisher; Now You See Me, Wedding Crashers), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner‚Äôs new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park; Always Be My Maybe, Aquaman), an anxious Great Dane who‚Äôs stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal‚Äîtogether hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home ‚Ä¶ and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. (Hint: It‚Äôs not his foot). \n\nA subversion of the dog movies we know and love, Strays, directed by Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) and written by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal), is a hilarious, R-rated, live-action comedy about the complications of love, the importance of great friendships, and the unexpected virtues of couch humping. \n\nFeaturing a powerhouse comedic supporting cast‚Äîincluding Grammy winner Josh Gad (Beauty and the Beast), Harvey Guill√©n (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish), Emmy nominee Rob Riggle (The Hangover), Brett Gelman (Stranger Things), Jamie Demetriou (The Afterparty), and Emmy nominee Sofia Vergara (Modern Family)‚ÄîStrays is produced by Picturestart founder and CEO Erik Feig (Luckiest Girl Alive, Cha Cha Real Smooth), by Louis Leterrier (director Fast X, The Clash of the Titans), by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal) and by Lord Miller partners Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) and Lord Miller President of Film Aditya Sood (The Martian, Cocaine Bear). \n \nThe film is executive produced by Jessica Switch, Nikki Baida and Julia Hammer.","title":"Strays | Official Trailer [HD]","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230208","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwOLKTbCUw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/BzwOLKTbCUw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":304567}}

{"description":"And why the US and China are fighting over silicon in the first place.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn October 2022, the Biden administration placed a large-scale ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to China. They also implemented a series of other rules that prevents China from making these chips on their own. These chips are used in everyday technology, like our mobile phones and computers. They‚Äôre also crucial to military and intelligence systems, which is one of the main reasons they're at the center of a feud between the United States and China. \n\nMicrochips were first invented in the US in the 1950s, after which their use rapidly expanded worldwide. Since then, the supply chain for these chips has grown and spread to include countries in Europe and Asia.

{"description":"Last week we received an invitation to Buckingham Palace to meet the King of England, and I got the chance to talk to him about Korea and what it means to me.\n\nMore than 20 years ago some Korean middle-schoolers went out of their way to welcome me into their friendship group. They made me feel at home and like I belonged, in a place where I had felt like an outsider.\n\n10 years ago I went out with my best mate Ollie to talk to people on the streets of London about Korea. And since then we‚Äôve had the privilege to introduce Korean culture and food to my friends, family and the world.\n\nThis was truly a surreal experience, and was an honour that we never would have received without all of you, so from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.\n\n--\n\nÏßÄÎÇú Ï£º, Ï†ÄÌù¨Îäî Î≤ÑÌÇπÏóÑ Í∂ÅÏ†ÑÏóê Ï¥àÎåÄÎ•º Î∞õÏïÑ ÏòÅÍµ≠Ïùò Íµ≠ÏôïÏùÑ ÎßåÎÇòÎµê Ïàò ÏûàÎäî ÌäπÎ≥ÑÌïú Í≤ΩÌóòÏùÑ ÌïòÍ≤å ÎêêÏñ¥Ïöî.

{"description":"Hogwarts Legacy reviewed by Travis Northup on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.\nIn nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I‚Äôve always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It‚Äôs certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn‚Äôt come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me.\n\n#HogwartsLegacy #HogwartsLegacyReview","title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review","duration":630,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230206","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6dZxoob8CY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6dZxoob8CY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2437260}}
