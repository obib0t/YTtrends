{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Peter Jackson\nVideo Producers: Peter Jackson, Clare Olssen, Jonathan Clyde\nAudio Producers: Paul McCartney and Giles Martin\nProduction Company: WingNut Films Productions Ltd\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists Subscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup Sign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   Stream The Beatles: 🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic 🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify 🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic 🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora 🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal 🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer 🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   Follow The Beatles:  ⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com ⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"The Beatles - Now And Then (Official Music Video)","duration":275,"channel_id":"UC4dqLAF7yT-_DqeYisQ001w","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231103","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opxhh9Oh3rg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Opxhh9Oh3rg/hqdefault.jpg?v=6544f101","content":{"View count":19444676}}

The craziest cars have come out to Las Vegas from @tavarish @TheStradman @DailyDrivenExotics @AlexChoi1 @TheHamiltonCollection @tjhunt_ @AdamLZ @MatArmstrongbmx and MORE!\n\nFor this year's SEMA Show in Las Vegas, the display of cars from YouTubers and social media personalities is absolutely on another level. Featuring complete transformations and wild builds all completed to be shown on the world stage, sitting alongside some unbelievable things in the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center. We're going for a highlights tour to try to find them all!\n\nIt's almost impossible to cover them all, and in the vast halls of the exhibition I am sure that there are some I could not track down, but even still it's remarkable to see all these projects that have been covered through thousands of hours of entertainment all on display. We have the likes of an array of cars from @GasMonkeyGarage including the Testa and Duke Dynamics 812, to catching up with @TheStradman to check out his Aventador alongside the Huayra Roadster and 918 Spyder from @TheHamiltonCollection. We're also able to catch up with Freddy to check out the P1 build project, TJ Hunt's SpeedHunters M4 GT3, Alex's 720LM and so many more.\n\nAlso along the way, it's a great chance to meet with @HooviesGarage @AdamC3046 @Hardupgarage @BenCollinsDrives and more legends of the car world.\n\nNot only that, but my new Mustang Dark Horse is on display at the Ceramic Pro booth! The Shmeemobile has covered 4,000 miles from collection just 10 days prior to SEMA, having been protected with Kavaca PPF from Ceramic Pro, and now presented in the event.\n\nFor your vehicle protection needs including PPF, ceramic coating, or even window tint, be sure to visit your local @CeramicProOfficial Elite Dealer, your one stop shop for all your needs: http://www.ceramicpro.com/shmee150\n\nFor more information follow Ceramic Pro on these channels:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ceramicprousa/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ceramicpro/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/elite.dealer/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kavaca/\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Intro\n00:50 @TheStradman Duke Dynamics Aventador\n01:25 @TheHamiltonCollection Hypercars\n02:35 SVJ & Carrera GT\n02:54 @tavarish 992 GT3\n04:02 @AdamLZ Supra 4-rotor\n04:35 @AlexChoi1 McDaddy 720LM\n06:04@DailyDrivenExotics Super Trofeo\n06:57 Ferrari F40\n07:46 @Shmee150 Dark Horse\n10:56 Road-legal Super Trofeo\n11:58 Ford Mustang FP800S\n12:55 @tjhunt_ M4 GT3\n13:40 @MatArmstrongbmx RS6 GT3\n14:38 @TheStradman Catch-up\n16:07 Lark P1 GTR and More\n18:13 P1 and @GasMonkeyGarage 812 Superfast\n20:02 Aventadors\n20:38 Gintani Exhausts\n20:52 Dark Horse Modifications\n21:44 @tavarish Flood Damage P1\n25:10 @tjhunt_ Supra\n25:35 @RobDahm Chat\n25:58 Ford Supervan & ECD\n26:51 @GasMonkeyGarage Testa\n27:57 @Hardupgarage & @BenCollinsDrives \n29:02 @AdamC3046 \n30:11 @CreativeBespoke \n31:03 S Klub LA 612 TR Teppista\n31:58 @MarkMcCann64 Chat\n33:00 @HooviesGarage Chat\n33:42 BendPak Stand Visit\n34:19 GuntherWerks Speedster\n34:37 @Petrolheadonism Corolla KE25\n35:25 Wrap Up\n\n#SEMA2023 #LasVegas #Highlights \n\nWATCH NEXT:\n🍿 COMPLETE TOUR of My Car Collection! 2023; 13 Years of YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/CBAbD9PD24g\n🍿 BUGATTI vs KOENIGSEGG!

{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nOrder/Listen to \"Now And Then\": https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order 'Red' and 'Blue': https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT \n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists\nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup\nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter\n \nStream The Beatles:\n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic\n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify\n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic\n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora\n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal\n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer\n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic\n \nFollow The Beatles:\n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com\n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"The Beatles - Now And Then (Official Audio)","duration":249,"channel_id":"UCc4K7bAqpdBP8jh1j9XZAww","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW55J2zE3N4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/AW55J2zE3N4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":6459063}}

{"description":"Director Wes Ball breathes new life into the global, epic franchise set several generations in the future following Caesar’s reign, in which apes are the dominant species living harmoniously and humans have been reduced to living in the shadows. As a new tyrannical ape leader builds his empire, one young ape undertakes a harrowing journey that will cause him to question all that he has known about the past and to make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike.\n\n“Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” is directed by Wes Ball (the “Maze Runner” trilogy) and stars Owen Teague (“IT”), Freya Allan (“The Witcher”), Kevin Durand (Locke & Key”), Peter Macon (“Shameless”), and William H. Macy (“Fargo”). The screenplay is by Josh Friedman (“War of the Worlds”) and Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver (“Avatar: The Way of Water”) and Patrick Aison (“Prey”), based on characters created by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver, and the producers are Wes Ball, Joe Hartwick, Jr. (“The Maze Runner”), Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Jason Reed (“Mulan”), with Peter Chernin (the “Planet of the Apes” trilogy) and Jenno Topping (“Ford v.

{"description":"The Stuntman becomes the hero. #TheFallGuyMovie only in theaters March 1.\n\n------\n\nHe’s a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right? \n\nFrom real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy. \n\nOscar® nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie—being directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)—goes missing.\n\nWhile the film’s ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film’s most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody’s good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.\n\nInspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). \n\nFrom a screenplay by Hobbs & Shaw screenwriter Drew Pearce, The Fall Guy is produced by Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, Nobody, Atomic Blonde) and David Leitch for their company 87North, and by Ryan Gosling and by Guymon Casady (Game of Thrones, Steve Jobs and executive producer of the upcoming series Ripley) for Entertainment 360. The film is executive produced by Drew Pearce, Entertainment 360’s Geoff Shaevitz and the creator of the original Fall Guy television series, Glen A. Larson.\n\nWebsite: http://www.TheFallGuyMovie.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thefallguymovie \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thefallguymovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Universalpics \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures\nX: https://twitter.com/thefallguymovie","title":"The Fall Guy | Official Trailer","duration":201,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7jPnwVGdZ8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/j7jPnwVGdZ8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":12812404}}

{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Oliver Murray \nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton \nOriginal score: Paul Englishby \nSound Designer: Alastair Sirkett \nAudio Restoration: Park Road Post Production\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists \nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup \nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   \n\nStream The Beatles: \n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic \n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify \n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic \n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora \n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal \n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer \n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   \n\nFollow The Beatles:  \n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com \n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"The Beatles - Now And Then - The Last Beatles Song (Short Film)","duration":745,"channel_id":"UC4dqLAF7yT-_DqeYisQ001w","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231101","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APJAQoSCwuA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/APJAQoSCwuA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5834105}}

The previous blower design is tear drop shaped so that the direction that the fan spins is un important. Also with the previous design the impeller spins one way and then the other as it is powered by a simple string mechanism.\n\n In the new design, a weight was employed in the form of a heavy log attached to the rotor. The top of the rotor is held and the weight spun to create rotation. This method produces less rpm than the original but allows the fan to be spun continuously in one direction only. To compensate for the lower rpm, the fan was doubled in size (from 25 cm to 50 cm) to increase blade tip speed and so air speed.\n\nNow with a fan that spins in one direction only, a housing could be used to take advantage of this fact. A volute is an expanding spiral and housing for fans that are volute shaped help guide the air from the center to the outlet more efficiently than a tear drop shaped one. This was made using mud on the ground as opposed to a clay portable one as it was starting to get too big to transport.\n\nThe fan was tested in an iron smelt. Disappointingly, it only produced a bit of iron in the form of much smaller prills than usual due to the low rpm and hence air pressure than the original blower. After some rough calculations from research, this design might become competitive with the original blower if the fan diameter was scaled up to 1m diameter from the original 25 cm diameter fan. \n\nThe advantage of this design is that it is simpler and has fewer components than the original as there is no string that needs replacing. The dis advantage is that for it to produce good pressure it's diameter needs to be scaled up to the point where it is no longer compact and portable.\n\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more.
