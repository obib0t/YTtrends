{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Yes, we did something bad. Now, as you guys may know... I love halloween. From the spooky decorations to the costumes, to the candy, oh yes, THE CANDY. From Snickers to Skittles to every Reese's shape imaginable, I am a halloween candy fiend. \n\nSo I had a horrible idea that I decided to act upon: what if we tried to melt every halloween candy together into a single franken-candy... the one candy to rule them all, and in the darkness, satiate my desire for an entire bucket of halloween candy in just one bite? \n\nWell, I guess we're gonna find out. Because that's what this video is about. \n\nBig thank you to Mat & StephPat from the Theorists, as well as Danielle & Karla from Escaz√π for being the guest tasters of our franken-candy bar!!

This DIY adventure took so much work, but Mac‚Äôs reaction to his new dog house was priceless. \n\nDuring this episode, Mac is taken on an unforgettable adventure through the city of Chicago, completing a list of challenges along the way. Watch as he ventures to Starbucks to taste test a puppacino, Navy Pier to see the ferris wheel, Lincoln Park zoo to visit the lions and so much more! This video is perfect for anyone who loves dogs, pet care content and pampering their furry friends.\n\nIf you have any comments, suggestions or questions for this luxury dog house fish tank video or future videos, leave them down in the comments!

Not only does the skeleton animatronic have awesome movement, but Spring trap actually has a human body trapped inside of him, so it really fits the character. His suit parts are a mixture of EVA foam and 3D printed parts, all covered in green fleece and painted to look old and decayed.\n\nThis ended up being a huge DIY project for us, and we ran into a bunch of speed bumps¬†along the way. We really hope you enjoyed seeing Springtrap in real life. Let us know what characters you want to see next!\n\nIf you love Halloween DIY projects, FNAF, and indie horror games and want to see more of our DIY Halloween props, check out our Dancing Withered Freddy and Huggy Wuggy animatronic.

{"description":"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John‚Äôs vocal from his piano part. \n\nAs a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles‚Äô endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history. \n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT \nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n \nVideo Director: Oliver Murray\nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton\nOriginal score: Paul Englishby\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists\nSubscribe to The Beatles‚Äô YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup\nSign up for The Beatles‚Äô Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter\n\nStream The Beatles:\nüéôÔ∏è Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Appl...\nüéôÔ∏è Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify\nüéôÔ∏è Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Amaz...\nüéôÔ∏è Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora\nüéôÔ∏è Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal\nüéôÔ∏è Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer\nüéôÔ∏è YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouT...\n \nFollow The Beatles:\n‚≠ê https://www.thebeatles.com\n‚≠ê https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n‚≠ê https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr","title":"Now And Then ‚Äì The Last Beatles Song (Short Film Trailer)","duration":35,"channel_id":"UCc4K7bAqpdBP8jh1j9XZAww","author":"The Beatles","date":"20231026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgFTpwB_uII","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KgFTpwB_uII/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1504283}}

It has been a tortuous journey for him and\neveryone around him. With each new revelation, Kanan has been forced to confront his\nfamily‚Äôs seemingly never-ending web of secrets and lies. He has spent much of this time\nin a state of denial, but now, Kanan‚Äôs blinders are finally off, and he doesn‚Äôt like what he\nsees. In season three, Kanan finds himself grappling with the very notions of right and\nwrong. Good and evil. Fidelity and disloyalty. And he‚Äôs not alone. Every member of the\nThomas family must confront an existential crisis that challenges their very identity.\nWhether it‚Äôs Marvin, who‚Äôs still trying to redeem himself, or Raq, who‚Äôs finally coming\nclean, or Lou, who‚Äôs wrestling with his own evil, or Jukebox, who‚Äôs simply trying to break\nfree from her family‚Äôs pathology, they are all attempting to redefine and reinvent themselves. They won‚Äôt all be able to complete this intensely personal quest, but for those who do, the destination may reveal the most terrifying secret of all. There is no right and wrong or good and evil. There are no absolutes. In the end, there‚Äôs just you.","title":"Power Book III: Raising Kanan | Season 3 Official Trailer | STARZ","duration":133,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20231026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3sgm-buSJo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/x3sgm-buSJo/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":5101679}}

Recognizing the unending loyalty of my furry best friend, we've embarked on an epic DIY adventure, showcasing the ultimate dog house build you have to see to believe. From a custom-designed rock wall, personal elevator, and an exclusive puppy pool to a top-notch entertainment system and gourmet kitchen, this two-story doggy haven sets a new standard in pet care. It's not just a dog house; it's a statement of the bond we share with our pets, blending comfort, luxury, and a dog's dream living space. But there's more! While we were immersed in this unique pet home construction, my sister took on a heartfelt task: giving our dog the most unforgettable day, filled with fun visits to his favorite spots like the local dog park and pet store, ensuring every moment was packed with happiness, play, and of course, his favorite treats. This is more than a typical 'building a dog house' scenario; it's a blend of creativity, luxury living for pets, and a celebration of the human-dog bond that viewers searching for dog care, luxury pet living, and epic DIY projects will not want to miss. We've tackled every challenge with determination, driven by the goal to see that wagging tail go into overdrive. Wait until you see the grand reveal at the end of this journey, capturing the priceless moment my dog sets paws into his luxury mansion for the first time. For anyone who loves dogs, enjoys creative pet care content, and believes in pampering their furry friends, this video is a must-watch. This was tricky to make, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible!
