{"description":"Teresa Xie | April 10, 2023\nWhen Fred again.. first proposed a Tiny Desk concert, it wasn't immediately clear how he was going to make it work — not because he lacked creativity, but because translating purely electronic music at the Desk is a daunting task for anyone. How would an artist, whose performances take the form of DJ sets in front of massive audiences, curate an intimate and unique experience? But what the British songwriter and producer came up with is a reminder of what a Tiny Desk is at its best: an opportunity for artists to challenge themselves in such a way that it almost feels like they're making new music, all while sticking to what feels true to them. For Fred again.. that meant re-learning the marimba, playing the vibraphone, singing at the piano and looping sounds and beats — all at the same time. He began his set with \"Kyle (i found you),\" recreating the song's melody on the marimba while clips of featured poet Kyle \"Guante\" Tran Myhre reciting the work \"Love In The Time of Undeath\" appeared on-screen. Sitting at the piano, he faded the remnants of \"Kyle (i found you)\" into \"Roze (forgive),\" which features Fred again.. triggering vocals sampled from the artist I am Roze, whose powerful facial expressions were magnified on a screen.In a surprising pivot, the primary vocals on the following track, \"Me (heavy),\" came from Fred again.. himself, with no manipulation, creating a vulnerable sense of intimacy in the space. A flurry of looped piano keys marked the transition to \"Delilah (pull me out of this),\" with guest vocals pulled from pop singer Delilah Montagu's 2021 track \"Lost Keys.\" By his set's end, concluding with \"Faisal (envelops me),\" Fred again.. was back at the piano finally resting after moving seamlessly through a jam-packed Tiny Desk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Kyle (i found you)\"\n\"Roze (forgive)\"\n\"Adam (interlude)\"\n\"Me (heavy)\"\n\"Berwyn (interlude)\"\n\"Delilah (pull me out of this)\"\n\"Faisal (envelops me)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nFred again..: vocals, piano, vibraphone, marimba, electronics\nSpecial thanks to: Guante, I Am Roze (they/them), Aminé, Delilah Montagu, Berwyn, Faisal, Lucy Hickling, Gareth Nunns, Jamie Tinsley, Tony Friend, Tobias Miorin \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Sofia Seidel \nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Sofia Seidel, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant \nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galván, Teresa Xie\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #fredagain","title":"Fred again..: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1604,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230410","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQmPv_dTI0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4iQmPv_dTI0/hqdefault.jpg?v=643085c1","content":{"View count":1070054}}

Somehow Heavy Spoilers has returned and with this episode clearly also setting up things coming in Ahsoka there's a lot to talk about. We of course also have that finale next week so make sure you don't miss a thing subscribing to the channel and also please smash that thumbs up button if you enjoy the video.\n\nThis is the way.\n\nAnuyway last week saw the who we time travelled with in the mans delorean getting taken down by Bo and The Mandalorian.\n\n-\n\nThis was in an effort to get back to Bo's old crew which is where she had an axe to grind over no longer being the leader. Defeating woves she then presented with the Darksaber due to her technically winning it in combat all the way back in episode 2.\n\nThat takes us into this entry which sees the return of Moff Gideon and also the introduction of The Shadow Council.\n\nGideon ends up getting his own Mandalorian armour in this entry and you might remember that back in our episode 5 breakdown that we talked about a big clue towards this.","title":"THE MANDALORIAN Season 3 Episode 7 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Easter Eggs & Review","duration":1955,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230412","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSX-fL-Cg4s","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cSX-fL-Cg4s/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":234434}}

{"description":"WELCOME TO BARBIE LAND, did you bring your rollerblades? 🌟 #BarbieTheMovie only in theaters July 21.\n\nTo live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you’re a Ken.\n\nFrom Oscar-nominated writer/director Greta Gerwig (“Little Women,” “Lady Bird”) comes “Barbie,” starring Oscar-nominees Margot Robbie (“Bombshell,” “I, Tonya”) and Ryan Gosling (“La La Land,” “Half Nelson”) as Barbie and Ken, alongside America Ferrera (“End of Watch,” the “How to Train Your Dragon” films), Kate McKinnon (“Bombshell,” “Yesterday”), Michael Cera (“Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” “Juno”), Ariana Greenblatt (“Avengers: Infinity War,” “65”), Issa Rae (“The Photograph,” “Insecure”), Rhea Perlman (“I’ll See You in My Dreams,” “Matilda”), and Will Ferrell (the “Anchorman” films, “Talladega Nights”). The film also stars Ana Cruz Kayne (“Little Women”), Emma Mackey (“Emily,” “Sex Education”), Hari Nef (“Assassination Nation,” “Transparent”), Alexandra Shipp (the “X-Men” films), Kingsley Ben-Adir (“One Night in Miami,” “Peaky Blinders”), Simu Liu (“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”), Ncuti Gatwa (“Sex Education”), Scott Evans (“Grace and Frankie”), Jamie Demetriou (“Cruella”), Connor Swindells (“Sex Education,” “Emma.”), Sharon Rooney (“Dumbo,” “Jerk”), Nicola Coughlan (“Bridgerton,” “Derry Girls”), Ritu Arya (“The Umbrella Academy”), Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter Dua Lipa and Oscar-winner Helen Mirren (“The Queen”).\n\nGerwig directed “Barbie” from a screenplay by Gerwig & Oscar nominee Noah Baumbach (“Marriage Story,” “The Squid and the Whale”), based on Barbie by Mattel. The film’s producers are Oscar nominee David Heyman (“Marriage Story,” “Gravity”), Robbie, Tom Ackerley and Robbie Brenner, with Michael Sharp, Josey McNamara, Ynon Kreiz, Courtenay Valenti, Toby Emmerich and Cate Adams serving as executive producers.\n\nGerwig’s creative team behind the camera included Oscar-nominated director of photography Rodrigo Prieto (“The Irishman,” “Silence,” “Brokeback Mountain”), six-time Oscar-nominated production designer Sarah Greenwood (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Anna Karenina”), editor Nick Houy (“Little Women,” “Lady Bird”), Oscar-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran (“Little Women,” “Anna Karenina”), visual effects supervisor Glen Pratt (“Paddington 2,” “Beauty and the Beast”), music supervisor George Drakoulias (“White Noise,” “Marriage Story”) and Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat (“The Shape of Water,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents a Heyday Films Production, a LuckyChap Entertainment Production, a Mattel Production, “Barbie.” The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and released in theaters only nationwide on July 21, 2023 and beginning internationally on July 19, 2023.","title":"Barbie | Teaser Trailer 2","duration":105,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.
