{"description":"Why the Congressional midterms matter so much.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nOn January 6th, 2021 (yes, during the capitol riots) the final Senate race of the 2020 election was called for a Democrat. All of a sudden Democrats had achieved something improbable: trifecta control of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. It transformed the possibilities for Biden’s first two years, giving his party the ability to legislate on their own - which they did.\n\nThe trillion-dollar stimulus, the infrastructure bill, the climate investments of the Inflation Reduction Act — all of that was only possible because of unified Democratic control. But even under divided government, both houses of Congress will still wield an enormous amount of power over national affairs and policy. That’s why the 2022 election isn’t just a referendum on whether Democrats should keep Congress — it’s a question of who gets that power, and how they’ll use it. And there are three ways it could all play out.\n\nOur buds at Vox.com also did this story in text form if you like reading! https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23435135/2022-midterms-congress-republican-democrat\n\nFor more reporting on the 2022 US midterm elections, read up here: https://bit.ly/3U3aGxB \n\nThere are 9 races that could decide the Senate control. Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin are some of the closest contests in the country. Keep up with us here: https://bit.ly/3WoXOnd \n\nChapters:\nThe 475 elections 00:00\n1. What if Democrats keep both houses? 0:46\n2. What if Republicans win the House of Representatives? 1:59\n3. What if Republicans win the Senate? 4:26\nWhose vote matters? 7:01\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Meet some of the defiant Russians pushing back against President Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on critics of the war in Ukraine. \n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate. \n\nFRONTLINE tells the inside stories of activists and journalists risking arrest and imprisonment to protest and speak out about the Kremlin’s war effort — from a young woman whose TikToks have gone viral internationally, to an artist facing up to 10 years imprisonment after posting anti-war stickers in a grocery store, to a university professor whose parents live in Ukraine, to independent reporters seeking the truth about the war — including its death toll among the country’s soldiers, information that Russia has deemed a state secret.\n\nAs Russia’s war on Ukraine approaches its ninth month and evidence of potential war crimes continues to mount, “Putin's War at Home” is a powerful look at the Russian leader’s efforts to stifle domestic criticism — and some of the people in his country who are speaking out anyway.\n \n“Putin’s Russia is based on fear,” one journalist says in the documentary, adding that, “we decided to continue without censorship, whatever the cost.”\n\n#Documentary #InsideRussia #UkraineWar\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS Video App, where more than 300 of our documentaries are available to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\n“Putin’s War at Home” is a Hardcash production for GBH/FRONTLINE in association with ITV. The producer and director is Gesbeen Mohammad. The producer is Vasiliy Kolotilov. The senior producer is Eamonn Matthews. The executive producer for Hardcash Productions is Esella Hawkey. The editor-in-chief and executive producer for FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.

{"description":"At least 17 missiles were fired by North Korea, according to South Korea who retaliated with their own missile testing. \n\nRELATED: Sirens sound alarm after North Korea fires missile over Japan\nhttps://bit.ly/3T1a36t\n\nThe U.S. Indo Pacific Command said the launches highlighted the “destabilizing impact” of North Korea’s illicit nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The Japanese Defense Ministry said it also detected the launches and that the type of missiles used and their flight information were still being analyzed.\n\nSouth Korea's Foreign Ministry said its top nuclear envoy held separate phone talks with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts soon after the launches. It said the three agreed to strengthen trilateral coordination on North Korea while repeating their calls for the North to stop weapons tests and return to talks.\n\nSince late September, North Korea has launched a barrage of missiles toward the sea in what it called simulated tests of tactical nuclear weapons systems designed to attack South Korean and U.S. targets. North Korea says its testing activities were meant to issue a warning amid a series of South Korea-U.S. military drills. But some experts say Pyongyang has also used its rivals’ drills as a chance to test new weapons systems, boost its nuclear capability and increase its leverage in future dealings with Washington and Seoul.\n\n» Subscribe to USA TODAY: http://bit.ly/1xa3XAh\n» Watch more on this and other topics from USA TODAY: https://bit.ly/3Uf6TNu\n» USA TODAY delivers current local and national news, sports, entertainment,  finance, technology, and more through award-winning journalism, photos, videos and VR.\n\n#NorthKorea #SouthKorea #Missile","title":"South Korea retaliates after North Korea fires missile launches | USA TODAY","duration":71,"channel_id":"UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g","author":"USA TODAY","date":"20221102","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzulTT93MVs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kzulTT93MVs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":359739}}

{"description":"Making mezcal is really hard work. Mexican producers harvest agave by hand and cook it in giant, earthen ovens. Then they crush it using a 1,000-pound, horse-drawn stone and distill it in copper pots. Despite all this effort, Mexican producers aren’t making the big bucks, even though demand for the spirit is booming.\n\nWhile Mexican regulations do require mezcal to be made in Mexico, that hasn't stopped large, international companies from scooping up mezcal supplies, repackaging, and reselling bottles for huge profits abroad. And the only organization that can stand in the way, the mezcal certifying agency COMERCAM, has faced claims of favoritism of these large companies. This has left some century-old mezcal brands frustrated and fearful that their ancestral ways of making mezcal are at risk. So, there's a growing trend of brands leaving the certified industry and choosing to call their brands \"distilled agave\" instead of mezcal.\n\nMORE BIG BUSINESS VIDEOS: \nHow Junior's Bakes 5 Million Cheesecakes During A Cream Cheese Shortage | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/hktm2mvQKc0\nAirlines Spend Billions, So Why Are Travelers More Miserable Than Ever? | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/MhhJuDap4CU\nQuinoa Prices Crashed.
