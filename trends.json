We stuffed our faces with numerous dishes, from the trash can-iest nachos at Guy Fieri's, to the elegant Italian pasta of Giada de Laurentiis, to the famed Beef Wellington at Gordon Ramsay's. Which restaurant would you try? Should we do a part 2 and go to the Jonas Brothers' restaurant?\n\nAlso, there is some controversy around foie gras that we weren't aware of before filming, our apologies.

The Feb. 27 launch attempt was scrubbed so mission teams could investigate a ground systems issue. NASA astronauts Stephen Bowen and Warren \"Woody\" Hoburg, as well as UAE (United Arab Emirates) astronaut Sultan Alneyadi and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev, will launch aboard their Dragon Endeavour spacecraft atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \n\nVisit our Crew-6 blog for the latest mission updates: https://blogs.nasa.gov/crew-6/ \n\nThis will be the fourth trip to space for Bowen, the Crew-6 mission commander, and the first space launch for the rest of the crew. They'll spend approximately six months on the station, helping us learn how to live in space while conducting research to make life better back on Earth. Learn more about the mission, its crew, and some of the science they'll be working on at https://go.nasa.gov/3jclMmJ. \n\nFollowing launch and ascent, NASA coverage of agency’s Crew-6 flight to the space station will temporarily switch to a streaming, audio-only feed accessible via YouTube, between ascent and the beginning of rendezvous operations.

The same as Djin Darin. We also see Paz Vizsla there amongst them, who helped Mando in the first season. He’s pretty cool with his gattling gun. He also is a direct descendant of Tarre Vizsla I assume as they have the same last name. Tarre Vizsla was the first jedi mandalorian, whom i believe Grogu will follow suit eventually. Now, this creed is different from other mandalorian sects, in which a mando cannot remove one’s helmet in the presence of any sentient being. As they say their creed and swear on the names of their ancestors that they shall walk the way of the mandalore, a massive sea monster emerges from the ocean, giving major jurassic park meets star wars vibes. \n\nSeeking retribution for his good will, we walks into the cave of the armorer where she says you removed your helmet, you are no longer a mandalorian. if we remember from the book of boba fett, he told her this and she said he’s no longer a mandalorian for this. The reason behind this is because they’re very traditional, they’re not like new mandalorians like bo katan who follow a more relaxed ideology and much less superstitious, but also to protect them by hiding their numbers. For it’s hard to track numbers by helmet as they can all look similar, but it’s easy to count by faces.\n\nShe says redemption is no longer possible since the destruction of mandalore.\n\nHe shows her a piece of crystal from Mandalore that Jawas bought from a random traveler. She is stunned to see it as it’s impossible for anyone to take anything from Mandalore, as setting foot on the planet would kill them as it is poisoned. Clearly, it hasn’t been, since he now has this proof.\nShe says this proves that mandalore’s surface has been crystalized by fusion rays, from all the bombing from the night of a thousand tears.\n\nThey leave to Navarro 7 in hyperspace, as Grogu looks out the window to notice massive space whales travelling with them in hyperspace. These are the Purgil we was from star wars rebels who helped Ezra and took him to an unknown place, along with Thrawn. I like how they showed this, it was a nice scene, and connects Ezra, Ahsoka, and Thrawn to the timeline. Maybe we’ll see them in this season of the mandalorian, maybe we will in Ahsoka’s show only. I guess we’ll see.\n\nThey head to Navarro 7 where we meet up with Greef Carga again, as he lands down and the town looks really clean and rennovated. Lots of life, merchants, aliens from all over. It’s buzzing with droids and beings. It looks great and very star wars, unlike Kenobi which barely had any aliens in it.\n\nWe come up to the IG-11 droid statue, where his parts have been salvaged as much as possible, and he stands as a becaon of hope to all for his efforts.\n\nGrogu uses the force to spin his chair, which is the same thing Yoda did in revenge of the sith at the end of the film on polis massa, albeit he wasn’t doing it for fun, he just had to turn to talk to Obi-Wan and Bail Organa as his feet are too short to touch the ground.\n\nThey walk off and Mando gets offered the job of Ranger where he asks about Cara Dune, where it’s revealed she was promoted to special forces when she brought Moff Gideon in. It’s a better send off for Cara than saying she’s dead or something, but I still wish she was in the show and that Gina didn’t get fired. Moff Gideon was sent to a New Republic War Tribunal.\n\nHeading to his final destination of the episode, Mando and Grogu arrive to kalevala, another planet in the mandalorian system and home to house Kryze as they come to a Mandalorian Castle…where Bo Katan is kicking her feet up on her empty throne, alone. They gave her a new wig this season and it looks very much like her animated form.\n\nShe’s melancholy because when she arrived back to her people without the dark saber, she lost all respect and her authority to lead them. She’s mad about it, and blames the children of the watch and all factions before it for dividing their people, instead of uniting them. She is of the new mandalorians who don’t care for such trivial uptight traditions like forbidding ones from removing helmets.\n\nShe says goodbye din djarrin in a nefarious tone…either she gave him some wack gps location where he’s gonna get killed, or she really thinks the planet is poisoned and he won’t make it out alive. Either way, she’ll probably go there to scoop up the dark saber from his lifeless body. The way she said goodbye with that jealous and angry tone, really makes her a questionable character now…is she an ally, neutral, or foe…i guess we’ll find out next episode.\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 1 BREAKDOWN - STAR WARS IS BACK","duration":951,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20230301","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsj7FBeo0Sg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qsj7FBeo0Sg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":252468}}

This will cause all sorts of problems in Russian-held territory: it will flood the area downstream, it will limit the irrigation of agricultural fields to the south, and it might limit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's ability to cool itself. Why is Russia doing this? The straightforward answer is that it will reduce Ukraine's ability to initiate an attack in Kherson, thereby freeing up Russian soldiers to pursue an offensive in the north. But it also hints at the possibility that Russia is running low on soldiers, otherwise Moscow would not be willing to incur these costs.\n\n0:00 Does Russia Have a Manpower Shortage?\n0:48 The Draining of the Kakhovka Dam and Reservoir\n2:18 Why Would Russia Release the Dam?\n4:00 Where the Flood Goes\n5:19 Irrigation Problems\n6:54 The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Problem\n8:22 Why Russia Is Probably Running out of Soldiers\n10:04 Or Maybe Russia WAS Running out of Soldiers\n11:30 Is the Russian Winter Offensive a Failure?\n12:59 Boris Johnson's Tie\n\nThe appearance of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) visual information does not imply or constitute DoD endorsement.\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY 2.0: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/):\n\nBy IAEA:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/52339383057/in/album-72177720301779673/\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/):\n\nBy IAEA:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/8506930028\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/iaea_imagebank/11083570446\n\nMedia licensed under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/):\n\nBy Kremlin.ru:\nhttp://kremlin.ru/news/20604\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/50329\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/57436\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/60490\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/62249\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/security-council/62933\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67061\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69390\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69465\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69737\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69743\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69756\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/69800\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70159\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70315\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70341\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70414\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70565","title":"Russia Just Took a Big Dam Risk.

Download the free Ground News app at https://ground.news/miniminuteman\n\nVIDEO INFO\nHowdy friends! In this video, we begin our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence for it.\n\nADDENDUM: At 48:00 I mistakenly class the Zigurrat at Ur as a burial structure. In reality, the Ziggurat was a temple to the Goddess of the moon. In research I got this crossed with the Royal Cemetary at Ur.

{"description":"Welcome to Sons Of The Forest! The much anticipated sequel to perfectly balanced survival game The Forrest. Similar to that game this one is rammed with various bugs, glitches and exploits that allow you to dupe items and break the laws of physics! Today we will be doing just that by showing one of the fastest and easiest ways to beat the game using just a stick! That's right, this entire 20+ hour game can be beaten with just a stick as sticks allow you to faze through reality. This is rather similar to an exploit in the forest that allowed you to speedrun through all of the locked keycard doors in the game! \n\nToday I will be crossing the entire survival island bypassing the keycard door into the underground lab. Skipping the 3d printing section and going straight for the endgame by sticking my way through the super special final secret door! Sure you might watch a beginer tips and tricks video telling you what to do and how to play the game. Or you could watch The Spiffing Brit explain how to break the laws of reality and bypass all of that fun sons of the forest gameplay with a good old fashion stick take that ign! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:40 - Crash Landing\n01:55 - We're off on an adventure!\n05:23 - The British Space Program\n08:25 - A Stick-y situation\n10:03 - Thinking outside the box\n11:31 - Spelunking\n14:12 - Finishing the Game\n16:36 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nDisclaimer: I am not sure who first discovered the stick glitch as I am 90% certain I am not the first to learn you can glitch the doors using sticks in both of the games. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: How I Beat SONS OF THE FOREST...

Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso\n\nIn the third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them to finish last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency.

{"description":"This is an emergency warning that bungie put out to tell players last minute that they can't play today unless they do this because of a bug they just found on xbox.\n\nSource:\nhttps://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1630476903009366018\n\nSpanish:\n Hola chicos, están aquí para jugar mañana. Resulta que hay un error que puede impedir que juegues. Esto solo debería afectar a los jugadores de xbox series x y xbox series s. No podrás conectarte a los servidores de Bungie. Hay una manera fácil de determinar si tiene este error. Si inicia el juego y llega al servidor sin conexión, entonces está listo para comenzar mañana. Si dice conectarse en la parte inferior derecha sin parar, no puede jugar mañana a menos que administre sus complementos. Debes desinstalar jokers wild, penumbra, forsaken annual pass, curse of osiris y warmind y luego guardar los cambios. Te mostraré cómo en este clip. Después de que se desinstalen, puedes salir del juego y reiniciarlo. Si se hace correctamente, ahora debería llegar al mensaje de servidor fuera de línea.\n\nDonate\nhttps://streamlabs.com/cheeseforever\n\nShare Cheese Forever\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/CheeseForever\n\nDirect Subscribe Link\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1M49CAo9u99gABBIqEgDQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nContact Me\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pastuleo23\nEmail: rootbeerpastuleo2@gmail.com\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hJfg8V2Haq\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cheese_forever_destiny/\n\nMerch Shop:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/cheese-forever\n\nBecome A Member\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1M49CAo9u99gABBIqEgDQ/join\n-Members have access to exclusive emojis in live streams as well as a members badge, access to member only video previews occasionally on my community tab, and can add me as a friend on discord.\n\nStreamers I Like\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/arrha_\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/iswype\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amps\n\nPlay Destiny 2 RPG Mobile (I made it myself):\nhttp://d2rpg.weebly.com/\nPreview - https://youtu.be/JPZ9gBRJTeY\n\n\n#CheeseForever #destiny2 #d2","title":"You Can't Play Destiny Today Unless You Do This First","duration":102,"channel_id":"UCl1M49CAo9u99gABBIqEgDQ","author":"Cheese Forever","date":"20230228","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07YGpQM2cU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/l07YGpQM2cU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":171707}}

{"description":"NASCAR continued its west coast travels with the Pala Casino 400 as Ross Chastain and Kyle Busch started stage one with a fury! Busch was a strong contender to win the first stage until he suffered a pit-stop penalty which played a role into Busch finishing 12th. Chastain cruised to a comfortable first-place finish. Chastain continued this theme in the second stage where he again finished in first place, followed by Kyle Busch and Joey Logano. However, in the final stage, Busch took it to another level and was able to win the Pala Casino 400. With the victory, Busch holds the all-time record for consecutive cup seasons with a victory at 19 and is now ninth in the all-time victories list.\n\n#NASCARonFOX #NASCAR #Fontana\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOX\nLike NASCAR on FOX on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXFacebook\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXTwitter\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXInstagram\n\nAbout NASCAR on FOX:\nYour home for NASCAR on FOX, from Raceday to Radioactive and all of the racing action in between.\n\n2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX\nhttps://youtu.be/ZXJyURa1Cww\n\nNASCAR on FOX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/NASCARonFOX","title":"2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX","duration":832,"channel_id":"UCWw4HqQcexuZfeFd4XLrNNg","author":"NASCAR on FOX","date":"20230227","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJyURa1Cww","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXJyURa1Cww/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":294257}}

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n#arctictrain #travel #sweden #norway\n\n00:00 intro/spoilers :)\n00:44 arctic train # 1 🗻\n04:10 world’s largest ice Hotel❄️\n13:57 NORTHERN LIGHTS🤩\n16:22 overnight sleeper train to Stockholm🛌\n24:51 showering on a train💁🏻‍♂️\n26:21 free hotel upgrade thanks to DAILY DROP!🔥\n27:13 Bloops😂","title":"Overnight Arctic Circle Train to World's Largest Ice Hotel","duration":1683,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20230225","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYFZFQeuXBE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/KYFZFQeuXBE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":899592}}

He moves to Paris to follow his dream, and with the help of hapless garbage boy Linguini he puts his culinary skills to the test in the kitchen but he has to stay in hiding at the same time, with hilarious consequences. Remy eventually gets the chance to prove his culinary abilities to a great food critic but is the food good?

{"description":"Hey guys! Today I attempt to \"Fix The Unfixable\" squishies in my collection. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my \"hopeless bin\" and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!\n\nDON'T FORGET TO GET THE ME PLAYING CARDS:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/p/7422520721599\n\n*available only until March 20th*\n\n________FAQs_________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try). \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nEvery Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:\nArtwork@Moriah.video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.
