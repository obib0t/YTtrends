{"description":"SpaceX is targeting as soon as Monday, April 17 at 8:00 a.m. CT for the first flight test of a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy rocket from Starbase in Texas. \n\nStarship is a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, help humanity return to the Moon and travel to Mars and beyond. With a test such as this, success is measured by how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship. \n\nTo date, the SpaceX team has completed multiple sub-orbital flight tests of Starship’s upper stage from Starbase, successfully demonstrating an unprecedented approach to controlled flight. These flight tests helped validate the vehicle’s design, proving Starship can fly through the subsonic phase of entry before re-lighting its engines and flipping itself to a vertical configuration for landing.\n\nIn addition to the testing of Starship’s upper stage, the team has conducted numerous tests of the Super Heavy rocket, which include the increasingly complex static fires that led to a full-duration 31 Raptor engine test – the largest number of simultaneous rocket engine ignitions in history. The team has also constructed the world’s tallest rocket launch and catch tower. At 146 meters, or nearly 500 feet tall, the launch and catch tower is designed to support vehicle integration, launch, and catch of the Super Heavy rocket booster. For the first flight test, the team will not attempt a vertical landing of Starship or a catch of the Super Heavy booster.\n\nA live webcast of the flight test will begin ~45 minutes before liftoff. As is the case with all developmental testing, this schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay tuned to our social media channels for updates.","title":"Starship Flight Test","duration":2755,"channel_id":"UCtI0Hodo5o5dUb67FeUjDeA","author":"SpaceX","date":"20230417","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5QXreqOrTA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L5QXreqOrTA/hqdefault.jpg?v=643c35de","content":{"View count":5217160}}

{"description":"At the Department of Collective Behaviour, part of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, researchers are putting locusts into simulated worlds, both virtual and physical, in the hope that they can figure out how devastating swarms form and move. ■ About the Centre: https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/ https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin\n\nEdited by Michelle Martin https://twitter.com/mrsmmartin\nThanks to David Walter for the suggestion\n\nThis is the most uncomfortable I've ever felt while filming, for a few reasons. First, of course, because of the locust swarm itself. Second, because animal research — even on creatures as simple and pestilent as locusts — always raises ethical questions. Now, the researchers are careful with the locusts, and I don't think many people could have a problem with this. Indeed, most of the world currently has zero ethical restrictions on insect experimentation — but it's still worth interrogating whether this is okay. And finally: because if we can do this so easily to less intelligent creatures... what's to stop something more intelligent coming along and doing the same to us?\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo","title":"It's the Matrix, but for locusts.","duration":424,"channel_id":"UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A","author":"Tom Scott","date":"20230417","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRIBVykhpC4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KRIBVykhpC4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGFkgWShZMA8=&rs=AOn4CLDT-NqBWWIt6LbWxzDA41VNd7teWg","content":{"View count":1245492}}

But then it's up to you to achieve success and take over New York City any way you like.\n\nSlowly build multiple small businesses, grow them into huge corporations, or carve your own unique path – the possibilities are limitless in this vast business sandbox. You've never played anything like this!\n\nGo from a small apartment and public transport to luxury suites, fast cars and designer furniture. Put your money into investment funds and real estate. Succeed, fail, rebuild. But remember to take care of yourself, sleep and stay happy on your rise to the top.\n\nDo you have what it takes to build your own empire?\n\n\nGo from nothing to the most prominent tycoon in New York. Start a business, work smart, make it thrive and enjoy your life. How do you want to be successful? How far can you push it? How long can you make it last?\n\nStart your own gift shop, supermarket, coffee shop, law firm, clothing store, liquor store, florist, and more. You decide what success is - whether it’s a single shop, a chain of fast-food restaurants, a huge corporation, or making millions developing websites.\n\nTake out a loan, rent a building, design the logo, renovate the store, get stock, manage your money, hire staff, and build your infrastructure. Soon, you may have to start importing products from the harbour and distributing them through a network of warehouses.\n\nA bigger business means managers. Hire HR Managers, Logistics Managers, and Purchasing Agents. They all need desks and computers, so you’ll need a fancy headquarters.\n\nNeed a delivery truck? Travel to a dealer and buy one. Need food? Go to a supermarket, but make sure you have a refrigerator at home. Big Ambitions is a life sim where your character has to physically interact with the world to survive and succeed.\n\nEnter any building in New York and buy it. Go from a small apartment to a dream penthouse in midtown, a luxurious townhouse in Hell’s Kitchen, or a series of skyscrapers. Fill each with furniture that suits your style and standing. Invest your hard-earned cash in real estate to grow your empire. Take over the city piece by piece.\n\nSpend your wealth however you wish. Buy a big SUV, a speedy sports car, or the new luxurious Mersaidi S500. Maybe risk it all at the casinos or put your money into investment funds and reap the rewards.\n\nAs you progress, you always need to ensure you get enough sleep and stay healthy and happy. Enjoy the journey, for as you grow older, you’ll discover that money can’t buy you time... or can it?\n\nBig Ambitions takes what you love about the viral sensation ‘Startup Company’ to even greater heights.","title":"I Became a Multimillionaire and Turned an Entire City Into a Total Wasteland - Big Ambitions","duration":1827,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20230416","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77zyN0WUuE0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/77zyN0WUuE0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1725163}}

We thought that cheese foam on bubble tea was good when we tried it on this channel, and cheesecake is good too (hey - cheese is good in general, right?), so this recipe might not be all that bad, even if it was originally intended to be an April fool’s joke.\n\nSo bring on the dairy - we’re making a Mac & Cheese Milkshake! Let us know how you think we did, and if you might want to try this lactose heavy delicacy. \n\nAlso PS - we had a slight complication with our camera on set, so the wide shot is a little soft focused.

In this video, we finish our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support this potentially history-altering theory.\n\nMY SOCIALS:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/miniminuteman/\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@miniminuteman\nE-Mail (Business inquiries only.

{"description":"Gordon Murray's astonishing £2.8m T.50 is a 963kg, 654bhp three-seater that aims to right the wrongs of the McLaren F1. Not that it was famed for many. But 969 days after we got our first proper look at it, Gordon has given the car his official stamp of approval to bring development to a close, meaning we could finally have a go in it. \n\nNow, we don’t normally do passenger rides at Top Gear, but when three-time Indy 500 winner Dario Franchitti gives you a ring to ask if you want a lift, you don’t say no. Especially when it involves some flat-out runs so we can hear that naturally aspirated V12 scream as he works the six-speed manual gearbox. And – best of all – as it's a three-seater, it meant both Top Gear Magazine’s Jack Rix and Ollie Marriage could both have a go. And then pincer Dario with questions at 180mph.\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks \nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

The battle, which was fought between British and French forces versus German forces, kicked off on July 1, 1916, and ended on November 18 that same year.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\nMusic video was produced by Video Ink Ltd. https://www.videoink.co.uk\n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.","title":"SABATON - 1916 (Official Music Video)","duration":454,"channel_id":"UCjQhd1APsd5NQhiVZV7GYzg","author":"Sabaton","date":"20230414","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgGhhnQB1gw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HgGhhnQB1gw/hqdefault.webp?v=6433c014","content":{"View count":512745}}

In the late 1950s, Air Force planners were confident that the advent of powerful new radars and long-range air-to-air missiles had rendered close-range aerial combat a thing of the past. So fighter jets like venerable the Mcdonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom were not engineered to be light or agile like their predecessors. Instead, they were designed to be heavily-loaded with missiles and carry powerful radars. Their pilots were no longer trained to dogfight, as they would engage the enemy at great distances, well beyond visual range. \n\nBut in the Vietnam War, military planners learned the hard way that the age of dogfighting was far from over. American pilots were being downed at alarming rates. The Friend or Foe (IFF) systems designed to identify enemy targets proved unreliable, forcing Air Force pilots to get in close to visually identify targets. At close-range, up against more agile Soviet-built MiGs, the F-4s were at a disadvantage. They were less agile than the MiGs, lacked a gun for close-range combat, and their pilots weren’t properly trained. To make matters worse, 1967, the Soviet Union looked set to unveil what appeared to be a new super-fighter built for extreme maneuverability. \n\nThe devastating experience from Vietnam and concerns being outclassed in the skies pushed the United States to develop a new air-superiority fighter that could face off with any current or future Soviet-built fighter. The result would be a twin-engine, high-performance, all-weather air superiority fighter known for its incredible acceleration and agility. Engineered from the ground up for tactical dominance in any air space, the F-15 holds the distinction of over a hundred aerial victories without a single defeat. \n\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\n\nIntro Song:  ‘Requiem for Humanity Alternate’- https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/CEZ_CET_9065\n\nSong 1: ‘The Final Warning’ - https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/MYMA_JUST_0234\n\nSong 2: ‘Weapon of Choice’ -  https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/JL2Rr4Yi1B/\n\nSong 3: ‘Infiltration And Investigation’ - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/141553842-infiltration-and-investigationdark-suspense-infiltration-sce\n\nSong 4: ‘Something Is Coming’ - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/102107772-b-lynne-something-coming-no-legato-strings-orchestra-epic-su\n\nSong 5: ‘80s Glam Rock’ - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-glam-rock/32401699\n\nSong 6: ‘Baliachi’ - https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/CEZ_CEZ_4256\n\nSong 7: ‘80'S Dark Synthwave’ - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/53759123-80s-dark-synthwave\n\nSong 8: ‘Viking Tension’ - https://audiojungle.net/item/viking-tension/40074535\n\nSong 9: ‘Synthwave Technology Industrial’ - https://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave-technology-industrial/35272023\n\nThanks for watching!","title":"The World's Greatest Fighter Jet: The F-15 Eagle","duration":861,"channel_id":"UC1ZBQ-F-yktYD4m5AzM6pww","author":"Mustard","date":"20230413","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmlWmDokzGg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RmlWmDokzGg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1234239}}

{"description":"The legend of Dracula is born. Watch the trailer for The Last Voyage of the Demeter now. \n\nThe Last Voyage of the Demeter\nIn Theaters August 11th\nhttp://demetermovie.com/\n\nFacebook: https://uni.pictures/TLVOTDFB\nInstagram: https://uni.pictures/TLVOTDIG\nTwitter: https://uni.pictures/TLVOTDTW\nTikTok: https://uni.pictures/UniTikTok\n\n---\nBased on a single chilling chapter from Bram Stoker’s classic novel Dracula, The Last Voyage of the Demeter tells the terrifying story of the merchant ship Demeter, which was chartered to carry private cargo—fifty unmarked wooden crates—from Carpathia to London. \n\nStrange events befall the doomed crew as they attempt to survive the ocean voyage, stalked each night by a merciless presence onboard the ship. When the Demeter finally arrives off the shores of England, it is a charred, derelict wreck. There is no trace of the crew.  \n \nThe film stars Corey Hawkins (In the Heights, Straight Outta Compton) as Clemens, a doctor who joins the Demeter crew, Aisling Franciosi (Game of Thrones, The Nightingale) as an unwitting stowaway, Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans) as the ship’s captain and David Dastmalchian (Dune, the Ant-Man franchise) as the Demeter’s first mate. \n \nThe film also features Jon Jon Briones (Ratched, American Horror Story), Stefan Kapicic (Deadpool films, Better Call Saul), Nikolai Nikolaeff (Stranger Things, Bruised) and Javier Botet (It films, Mama).\n \nFrom DreamWorks Pictures and the producers of Zodiac and Black Swan, The Last Voyage of the Demeter is directed by Norwegian horror virtuoso André Øvredal (Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark, Trollhunter), from a script by Bragi F. Schut (Escape Room), Stefan Ruzowitzky (The Counterfeiters) and Zak Olkewicz (the upcoming Bullet Train), based on the chapter “The Captain’s Log” of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. \n \nThe film is produced by Brad Fischer and by Oscar®-nominated producer Mike Medavoy and Arnold Messer for Phoenix Pictures and is executive produced by Matthew Hirsch.","title":"The Last Voyage of the Demeter | Official Trailer","duration":155,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230413","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FgUUO9Ztd0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6FgUUO9Ztd0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":6726625}}

{"description":"Today AD is welcomed by Troian Bellisario and Patrick J. Adams for a tour of their 1924 Spanish Colonial Revival home in Los Angeles. Designed by one of the lions of the golden age of California architecture, Wallace Neff, its white stucco exterior, colorfully tiled main staircase, and wrought-iron details are all calling cards of his numerous Spanish-influenced homes. The actors and homeowners—Adams is best known for his role on _Suits_ in which he played Meghan Markle’s character’s love interest, while Bellisario starred on the popular teen drama _Pretty Little Liars_ —fell in love with the residence while in the midst of planning their 2016 wedding and moved in right after their honeymoon, embarking on renovations a few years later with designer Rosa Beltran. “The goal was to make it feel how Neff and the team of artisans who had worked on the home in the beginning would have wanted it to feel, and also to make it really comfortable and useful for a modern-day family,” says Beltran.\r\n\r\nSee more from Troian and Patrick's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/tour-troian-bellisario-and-patrick-j-adamss-eclectic-spanish-colonial-revival-home\r\n\r\nShop Troian and Patrick’s home style!\r\n\r\n*Lighting* \r\n(Similar) Etsy Mid Century Wall Sconce: https://fave.co/3KEK8j0\r\nWest Elm Metalized Glass USB Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3zUiucM\r\n(Similar) Boost Area Floor Lamp: https://amzn.to/3GDAU56\r\nWest Elm Caldas Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3MEJ6Gi\r\nLumens Currey & Company Nottaway Chandelier: https://fave.co/41mo2Z5\r\nJWDA Table Lamp: https://fave.co/41j5xp3\r\n(Similar) Etsy Moroccan Handmade Lamp: https://fave.co/3zYR5Gk\r\n\r\n*Accessories*\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Clay Planter: https://fave.co/3MEEShU\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Kilim Lumbar Pillows: https://fave.co/3KwMLmO\r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Aqua Glass Mannequin Head: https://fave.co/411ip2B\r\n(Similar) Etsy Framed Blue Papilio Ulysses Butterfly: https://fave.co/4051Fqf\r\n(Similar) Etsy Los Angeles Highway Print: https://fave.co/3Kv9bF6\r\nOur Place Always Pan: https://fave.co/3KRY4az\r\n(Similar) Etsy Large Vintage Cutting Board: https://fave.co/41FKT2b\r\nAarke Carbonator: https://amzn.to/3KEPN8K\r\n(Similar) Etsy Greek God Head Planter: https://fave.co/410ZZPR\r\nDS & Durga Bowmakers Perfume: https://fave.co/41sf78F\r\nAesop Hand Soap: https://fave.co/401RX80\r\nEveryday Oil: https://amzn.to/3MEUYbd\r\nChemex Pour Over Coffee Maker: https://amzn.to/3GCHOrk\r\n(Similar) Revival Rugs Aritomo Vintage Turkish Rug: https://fave.co/3KurF8B\r\n\r\n*Furniture*\r\n(Similar) Glitzhome Terrazzo Plant Stand: https://fave.co/3GCURci\r\n(Similar) Chairish Rustic Elm Console Table: https://fave.co/3GBW4Aw\r\n(Similar) CB2 Flynn Velvet Ottoman: https://fave.co/411NlA4\r\n(Similar) Amazon Wood Barstool: https://amzn.to/404mRwg\r\n(Similar) Anthropologie Wallace Cane and Oak Sideboard: https://fave.co/3KSfmo2\r\n(Similar) Wayfair Leather Conference Chair: https://fave.co/3KAFsKC\r\n(Similar) Sundays Coastline Ottoman: https://fave.co/414PUkT\r\nArticle Sven Sofa: https://fave.co/409m2Cl\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nArtwork By: \r\nEdward Burtynsky https://www.edwardburtynsky.com/ \r\nLorien Haynes https://www.lorienhaynes.com/artist-work \r\nAndric Ljubodrag https://www.ljubodrag-andric.com/ \r\nKeita Morimoto https://www.keitamorimoto.com/ \r\nPat Perry https://patperry.net/art/paintings\r\nLindsey Ross https://www.lindseyrossphoto.com/about\r\nMax Wanger https://www.maxwanger.com/\r\n\r\nDirector: Winter Dunn\r\nDirector of Photography: AJ Young\r\nEditor: Ron Douglas\r\nTalent: Patrick Adams, Troian Bellisario\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nLine Producer: Joe Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Josh Crowe\r\nProduction Manager: Peter Brunette\r\nEquipment Manager: Kevin Balash\r\nCamera Operator: Josh Anderson\r\nAudio: Gray Thomas-Sowers\r\nProduction Assistant: Fernando Barajas\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague \r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nTalent Booker: Luke Leifeste\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nJunior Editor: Paul Tael\r\nAssistant Editor: Justin Symonds\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

{"description":"Launching on April 26, The Duviri Paradox is an entirely new way to play #Warframe – no matter where you are in your journey. If you’re a new Tenno, you’ll be asked to choose where you want your story to begin: The Origin System or The Duviri Paradox. Both paths will converge in time, but it’s up to you to decide.\n\nAn astonishing new experience awaits you once you assume the role of The Drifter and explore the vast, color-shifting Planes of Duviri through a gritty new Cinematic Quest. But be careful, Tenno. Your attempts to wrest control of this new open world will not go unnoticed by the despotic Dominus Thrax, whose emotions transform the fabric of Duviri itself. Fly high atop your loyal Kaithe solo, or Squad up with fellow Tenno to take on spectacular new threats like the fearsome Orowyrm. Will you restore Duviri before the next Spiral?\n\nFor full details on The Duviri Paradox, visit the official website here: https://www.warframe.com/the-duviri-paradox\n\n►► WHAT IS WARFRAME? \n\nJoin 70M+ registered players in Warframe, a cooperative, free-to-play third-person looter shooter set in a constantly evolving sci-fi universe.

Kennedy is on a mission to rescue Dr. Antonio Taylor from kidnappers, when a mysterious woman thwarts his pursuit. Meanwhile, B.S.A.A. agent Chris Redfield is investigating a zombie outbreak in San Francisco, where the cause of the infection cannot be identified. The only thing the victims have in common is that they all visited Alcatraz Island recently. Following that clue, Chris and his team head to the island, where a new horror awaits them. Directed by Eiichiro Hasumi (Assassination Classroom) from a screenplay by Makoto Fukami (Psycho-Pass). Based on Resident Evil, the hit survival-horror game that sold over 130 million copies worldwide, Death Island is a new CG animated film and sequel to Resident Evil: Vendetta.
