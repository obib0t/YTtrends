{"description":"Watch live as our mega Moon rocket launches an uncrewed Orion spacecraft on a 26-day mission around the Moon and back to Earth. NASA is targeting Wednesday, Nov. 16, for the launch of the Artemis I Moon mission during a two-hour launch window that opens at 1:04 a.m. EST (0604 UTC). During #Artemis I, Orion will lift off aboard the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and travel 280,000 miles (450,000 km) from Earth and 40,000 miles (64,000 km) beyond the far side of the Moon, carrying science and technology payloads to expand our understanding of lunar science, technology developments, and deep space radiation.  \n\nThrough Artemis missions, NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon, paving the way for a long-term lunar presence and serving as a steppingstone to send astronauts to Mars.

That’s why I was absolutely stoked when I got a call from none other than Karl Jacobs asking me if I could build him a giant computer so that he could beat Minecraft on it. You see I have a habit of building the most insane builds on YouTube like transforming my bedroom into a cereal bowl, building Squid Game doll for MrBeast, and building giant boxing gloves for Jake Paul. That’s why it was a no brainer for me to not only make Karl a giant computer, but to make him the WORLD’S LARGEST computer! if you don’t know Karl he is the largest gaming creator in the world, largest Twitch streamer, and a main character in many MrBeast videos. This project was absolutely insane to make and we definetly bit off more than we could chew, but it turned out amazing in the end and Karl’s reaction was priceless. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! What would YOU do with the world’s largest computer??\n\nNot Building the Largest PC Setup, But Building the $1,000,000 Computer,  But I bought the BIGGEST Tech in the world, But We FINISHED the $100,000 PC - 6 Editors 1 CPU, But I Built the World's Largest Gameboy, But I Built The World's Largest Minecraft Statue, But We Made the World's Largest Bath Bomb, But I Built The World's Largest Lego Tower, But I Built World’s Largest Minecraft Sword, But I Built Worlds Biggest YouTubers, But I Built a Survival Shelter, But I Built Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, or any other video like Karl, UnspeakablePlays, MrBeast, Vat19, Jake Carlini, Linus Tech Tips, Mrwhosetheboss, Ben Azelart, Stokes Twins, Preston, Airrack, Unspeakable, or Ryan Trahan would make.

{"description":"Just in time for Valentine’s Day comes the third installment of the \nblockbuster “Magic Mike” film franchise, the musical comedy “Magic Mike’s Last \nDance.” The creative team behind the first film, which garnered praise from critics \nand audiences alike, has reunited to create the magic again: Channing Tatum \nreprises his role as Mike Lane and Steven Soderbergh returns to the helm with a \nscript from Reid Carolin, who also wrote the first two films. And starring alongside \nTatum is Salma Hayek Pinault (“House of Gucci,” “Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard”).\n“Magic” Mike Lane (Tatum) takes to the stage again after a lengthy hiatus, \nfollowing a business deal that went bust, leaving him broke and taking \nbartender gigs in Florida. For what he hopes will be one last hurrah, Mike heads \nto London with a wealthy socialite (Hayek Pinault) who lures him with an offer he \ncan’t refuse…and an agenda all her own. With everything on the line, once Mike \ndiscovers what she truly has in mind, will he—and the roster of hot new dancers \nhe’ll have to whip into shape—be able to pull it off?\nThe film’s producers are Nick Wechsler, Gregory Jacobs, Tatum, Carolin and \nPeter Kiernan. Julie M. Anderson serves as executive producer.\nAlso starring with Tatum and Hayek Pinault are Ayub Khan Din (“Ackley \nBridge”), newcomer Jemelia George, Juliette Motamed (“We Are Lady Parts”) \nand Vicki Pepperdine (“Johnny English Strikes Again”).\nSoderbergh’s creative team behind the scenes includes production \ndesigner Pat Campbell (“The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself”), costume designer \nChristopher Peterson (“The Irishman”) and music supervisor Season Kent (“KIMI,” \n“Let Them All Talk”), with choreography by Alison Faulk and Luke Broadlick, both \npart of the “Magic Mike” franchise.\nA Warner Bros. Pictures Presentation, “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” slides into \ntheaters only in North America on February 10, 2023 and internationally beginning \n8 February 2023, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

{"description":"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - Only In Theaters this Christmas\n\nThis Christmas, everyone’s favorite leche-loving, swashbuckling, fear-defying feline returns.  \n\nFor the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. \n\nAcademy Award® nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar® nominee Salma Hayek). \n\nIn their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided—against their better judgment—by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guillén, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar® nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, “Big” Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).\n \nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish features an all-star comedic cast that includes Oscar® winner Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone (Black Widow), Samson Kayo (Sliced), Emmy nominee Anthony Mendez (Jane the Virgin) and Tony nominee Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Trolls World Tour).  \n \nThe long-awaited follow-up to the 2011 Academy Award®-nominated blockbuster, The Last Wish is directed by Joel Crawford and produced by Mark Swift, the creative team behind DreamWorks Animation’s smash, The Croods: A New Age. The film’s executive producer is Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri. \n \nThe character of Puss in Boots first appeared in 2004’s Oscar®-nominated Shrek 2 and instantly became a global, scene-stealing sensation. Puss then co-starred in two other Shrek sequels and his solo film, as well as in multiple DreamWorks Animation videos and TV series. The Shrek and Puss in Boots films have collectively earned more than $3.5 billion worldwide. \n\nSocial Handles\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pussinboots \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Dreamworks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pussinboots  \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@pussinboots\nWebsite: https://www.PussInBootsMovie.com \n#PussInBoots","title":"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - Official Trailer 3","duration":177,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20221115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHb7WlgyaUc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tHb7WlgyaUc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":3668989}}

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎\n\n00:00 Stairway to Heaven, explained\n00:49 Are we prepared for this?\n02:36 Our first solo via ferrata\n08:36 We love Public Lands!\n09:59 Overnight in the mountain hut\n14:20 Emotional morning of the climb\n16:54 HERE WE GO\n20:48 THE LADDER\n29:52 BLOOPS","title":"WE CLIMBED THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS LADDER (2,000 Foot Drop)","duration":1858,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20221112","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cw2zzop8-A","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2Cw2zzop8-A/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":846438}}
