{"description":"Stephen Thompson | September 29, 2023\nWhat you've got here is a perfect 20-minute distillation of The Sam Smith Experience: The Grammy-winning 2014 ballad that kicked off the singer's career (\"Stay With Me\"), a sleek dance-pop banger (\"How Do You Sleep\") and a chart-topping dollop of debauched hedonism (\"Unholy\") bundled together with \"Lay Me Down,\" in which Smith performed a gorgeous duet with LaDonna Harley-Peters. From the stately to the louche and bawdy — Smith even introduced \"Unholy\" with a perfect summation of their recent artistic direction: \"Let's get saucy!\" — it's all here.\n\nPerforming with an 11-person choir and two instrumentalists — sadly, Kim Petras wasn't there to emerge from between Smith's legs as if she were being birthed — Smith brought an overflowing bag of tricks to the proceedings. But what really shone through was a sense of movement: Each song swayed and played effervescently, centering Smith while also elevating every other magnificent voice in support. This set may not serve as anyone's introduction to the music of Sam Smith, but it's still a hell of a gateway — and a joy to behold.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Stay With Me\"\n\"How Do You Sleep\"\n\"Lay Me Down (feat.

{"description":"92 %ers, and probably a lot of you entering your “football era”, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Accelerator Active Energy! \n\nIn this episode, we break down the Eagles' dominant win on Monday Night Football, how much better this Eagles D-line might be than last year and the right time to go for the hurdle. \n\nWe also recap the most talked about 30-point win in the history of the NFL, the Chiefs' big win against the Bears. We’ll get to why the Chiefs offense is finally clicking, Big Red’s career milestone, and we finally talk about it, Taylor Swift paid a visit to the Chiefs Kingdom. \n\nAlso, we answer some not-dumb football questions from the Swifties, try and figure out just how the Dolphins dropped 70 on the Broncos, and let you know if we would have kicked the record-breaking field goal. \n\nThis Friday we will be dropping our incredible episode with The Chiefs Chris “Stone Cold” Jones! The guys talk about everything from his new contract, his wardrobe malfunction at the combines, what he likes least about offensive linemen, and why he wants to get lined up against Tyreek Hill. \n\nMake sure you’re subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don’t miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nACCELERATOR ACTIVE ENERGY: Available nationwide at Target or visit https://ashoc.com/ to find the store nearest you.  \n\nSTATE FARM: https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/multiline or talk to a State Farm agent today to learn how you can bundle and save with the Personal Price Plan.

{"description":"Don’t let the cat out of the bag. #ArgylleMovie, in theaters February 2, 2024.\n\nArgylle\nOnly In Theaters February 2\nhttps://www.argyllemovie.com/\n\n---\nThe greater the spy, the bigger the lie.\n \nFrom the twisted mind of Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman franchise, Kick-Ass) comes Argylle, a razor-witted, reality-bending, globe-encircling spy thriller.\n \nBryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World franchise) is Elly Conway, the reclusive author of a series of best-selling espionage novels, whose idea of bliss is a night at home with her computer and her cat, Alfie. But when the plots of Elly’s fictional books—which center on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate—begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.\n \nAccompanied by Aiden (Oscar® winner Sam Rockwell), a cat-allergic spy, Elly (carrying Alfie in her backpack) races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between Elly’s fictional world and her real one begins to blur.\n \nThe top-flight ensemble cast features Henry Cavill (The Witcher), John Cena (Fast X), Oscar® winner Ariana DeBose (West Side Story), Grammy winning pop superstar Dua Lipa (Barbie), Emmy winner and Oscar® nominee Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Emmy winner and comedy icon Catherine O’Hara (Schitt’s Creek), Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service), and the legendary Samuel L. Jackson. Alfie is played by Chip, the real-life cat of supermodel Claudia Vaughn (née Schiffer).\n \nArgylle is directed and produced by Matthew Vaughn, from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs (Wonder Woman). The film is produced by Matthew Vaughn, Adam Bohling (Kingsman franchise), Jason Fuchs, and David Reid (Kingsman franchise). The executive producers are Adam Fishbach, Zygi Kamasa, Carlos Peres and Claudia Vaughn.\n \nApple Original Films presents, in association with MARV, a Cloudy production. Argylle is distributed by Universal Pictures.","title":"Argylle | Official Trailer","duration":159,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230928","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mgu9mNZ8Hk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7mgu9mNZ8Hk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":6435814}}
{"description":"Walkers, \n\nEarlier this year, @Vikkstar123 and I decided to go to the studio together – we started on a new version of the 90s hit \"Better Off Alone\" by @alicedj Little did I know what awaited me when we decided to release this track just a few weeks ago.\n\nIn recent weeks, we've not only worked on giving a new life into this iconic melody but also had the opportunity to collaborate with the original producers of \"Better Off Alone,\" Seb & Eelke, who are also the masterminds behind theTrance project @dashberlin They've introduced us to their new frontman, Ryan, and together, we've recorded the track, filmed a music video, and had some fantastic days of planning and promotion in Oslo. Along the way, I've even been hunted by a crazy cat smurf who seemed to be following me around, but now we're finally ready to share the song and music video with all of you.\n\nYou all know how much I value collaboration and the magic that happens when people come together to make music and share experiences. Being a part of this journey has been an absolute honor.

{"description":"Be careful what you wish for ⭐️ Watch the NEW trailer for Disney's #Wish, coming only to theaters this Thanksgiving. \n\nRevealed today are additional members of the film’s voice cast, who join previously announced cast members Ariana DeBose, who voices 17-year-old heroine Asha; Chris Pine, who lends his voice to the formidable King Magnifico; and Alan Tudyk, who provides the memorable voice of Asha’s pet goat, Valentino. \n\nCast members include:\nAngelique Cabral as Queen Amaya, the wife and sounding board of King Magnifico; Victor Garber as Asha’s grandfather, Sabino, who—at 100 years old—is patiently waiting for his wish to be granted; and Natasha Rothwell as Asha’s loving and supportive mom, Sakina.\n \nPlus, Asha’s tight-knit group of confidants, protectors and forever friends: Jennifer Kumiyama as Asha’s dearest friend, Dahlia, who’s an accomplished baker and unofficial leader of their group; Evan Peters as the strong guy with a big heart and bigger yawn, Simon; Harvey Guillén as Gabo, who may be cynical, but he has a heart of gold; Ramy Youssef as Safi, who’s plagued by allergies; Niko Vargas as Asha’s joyful, always smiling buddy, Hal; Della Saba as the seemingly shy teenager, Bazeema, who’s full of surprises; and Jon Rudnitsky as Asha’s rosy-cheeked, wiggly-eared pal, Dario.\n \nABOUT THE MOVIE\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios’ “Wish” is an all-new musical-comedy welcoming audiences to the magical kingdom of Rosas, where Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe—the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico—to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Featuring the voices of Academy Award®-winning actor Ariana DeBose as Asha, Chris Pine as Magnifico, and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino, the film is helmed by Oscar®-winning director Chris Buck (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), and produced by Peter Del Vecho (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Juan Pablo Reyes Lancaster Jones (“Encanto”). Jennifer Lee (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) executive produces—Lee and Allison Moore (“Night Sky,” “Manhunt”) are writers on the project. With original songs by Grammy®-nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer/songwriter/musician Benjamin Rice, plus score by composer Dave Metzger, “Wish” opens only in theaters on Nov. 22, 2023. \n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneywishmovie/ / https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\n\nHashtag: #Wish","title":"Wish | Official Trailer","duration":142,"channel_id":"UC_976xMxPgzIa290Hqtk-9g","author":"Walt Disney Animation Studios","date":"20230927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyRxxpD3yNw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oyRxxpD3yNw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":5079803}}

This time, the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists.

{"description":"Why haven’t we covered them in solar panels?\n\nThis episode is presented by Delta. Delta doesn’t have a say in our editorial, but they make videos like this possible. For more information, visit http://www.delta.com/sustainability.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn 2021, President Biden set an ambitious climate goal for the US to reach net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050. And as part of the transition to renewable energy, the country has drastically ramped up production of solar over the past few years. But that’s led to a new problem: finding enough land on which to put solar panels. \n\nThe easiest and cheapest places to install solar panels are often large, undeveloped plots of land. It's why, in many places across the country, we've seen rural areas — including fragile desert ecosystems and valuable farmland — turned into solar farms. Many local residents and conservationists have protested these rural solar projects for a variety of reasons: Some want to keep natural views, others want to retain space for agriculture or aim to preserve biodiversity. Solar will likely play an important role in the country’s move away from fossil fuels — but is there a smarter way to do it that doesn’t require taking up so much rural land?\n\nIn the video above, we explore one option that could help: parking lots. Solar photovoltaics researcher and professor Joshua Pearce goes into the data on how placing solar canopies over parking lots could be a worthwhile investment for many cities. And as more countries, like France, are moving toward retrofitting parking spaces with solar, we look at what it could mean in the US.   \n\nSOURCES:\n\nStudies: \nhttps://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1177&context=materials_fp \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148121000756?via%3Dihub \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03957-7 \nhttps://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/ \n\nFurther reading: \nhttps://e360.yale.edu/features/putting-solar-panels-atop-parking-lots-a-green-energy-solution \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/02/06/france-solar-parking-lots/ \nhttps://www.vox.com/2021/8/18/22556193/solar-energy-biodiversity-birds-pollinator-land \n\nVox is on a mission is to help everyone, regardless of income or status, understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape it.\n\nWatch our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyE\nFollow Vox on TikTok: http://tiktok.com/@voxdotcom\nCheck out our articles: https://www.vox.com/\nListen to our podcasts: https://www.vox.com/podcasts","title":"How to fight climate change with parking lots","duration":511,"channel_id":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","author":"Vox","date":"20230927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaQUhAOdtk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yeaQUhAOdtk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":534199}}

The Three-Way Knockouts are also back. This time, however, artists will select their own songs to perform.\n\nOnce the Live Performance Shows begin, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast. This time, the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists.

{"description":"Today we completely dismantle a new iPhone 15 Pro Max to see how much titanium Apple has overlayed onto their aluminum frame. Anker Nano USB-C Fast Charging Lineup for iPhone 15 on Amazon: https://ankerfast.club/HNUBgh and on Anker.com: https://shop.anker.com/21iTX8 According to lab tests, the 5,000mAh Anker Nano Power Bank can charge an iPhone 15 to 79%. Power loss from internal components may prevent a full charge.\n\nTitanium is a really expensive material. Titanium is also EXTREMELY difficult to work with. But its really cool to see how Apple has assembled their new iPhone 15 Pro Max from the inside.

{"description":"It's November 11, 2011. Todd Howard has just unleashed Skyrim into the world. No patches. Release build. Take his word for it: it just works. Join me today as I play through the original release of Skyrim, but every time I encounter a glitch, bug or exploit.. my health is reduced by 5. It's going to be quite a journey...  \n\nA HUGE THANK YOU TO Nighthawk and the Team at Skyblivion for helping duct tape together a working copy of the release build of skyrim for me! And No I cannot legally distribute it to you sorry...\n\nAs Bethesda have just released starfield that has been a relatively bug free game excluding all of the exploits I felt it was important to go back in time and see if we can compare the release build of skyrim to a starfield review of sorts. Now as Todd Howard would never lie and every one of his games have the it just works seal of gameplay approval it is impossible for us to have a non perfectly balanced experience! So begone Skyrim Anniversary edition because we are going to the original! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n\nChapters\n00:00 - Skyrim Release Build\n01:05 - Back Again!\n03:32 - Meet Nord Nordinson\n04:36 - The Glitches Begin\n08:10 - Our Journey Finally Begins…\n13:14 - Out into the world!\n19:24 - Faendal no!\n21:55 - Off to Whiterun…\n24:37 - Let’s Fight a Dragon!\n28:57 - Thanks, Todd\n33:55 - Meet Skyrim - 480p mode\n36:42 - Horse Shenanigans\n39:57 - My Great Folly (which is Todd’s Fault)\n41:11 - BIG FINISH\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: Can I Beat Skyrim's Release Build?
