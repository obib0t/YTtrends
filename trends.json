{"description":"Suraya Mohamed | September 5, 2023\nChlöe Bailey and her band were scheduled to fly in the day before this show. But with thousands of flights delayed or canceled at the start of the 4th of July holiday weekend, one member couldn't make it into town. Because the arrangements were designed for two background vocalists, it didn't make sense to have just one and the team decided the ensemble would go without.\n\nBut you would never know something was missing here. Chlöe filled the room with a stunning vocal performance, her positive spirit and light radiated throughout the entire room. The band exuded a special energy too. Right from the first note, they locked into a groove that felt really good. \"Surprise,\" a hit from 2022, started out the set with a sexy bump and grind, R&B vibe that segued right into the body-popping \"Body Do.\" Next up was \"I Don't Mind,\" an afrobeat-infused party jam that really demonstrates her wide vocal range.\n\nThe party mood stayed strong with \"Worried,\" another favorite from her 2023 debut album In Pieces. Its reflective title track speaks to Chlöe's transparency around being vulnerable. She said, \"A lot of times I've been broken down and the cracks will be left, but that doesn't make me imperfect or it doesn't take away any beauty I have deep inside.\" That lovely disposition continued into the last song, \"Cheatback,\" a reminder that even if we think of seeking revenge, karma matters.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Surprise\"\n\"Body Do\" \n\"I Don't Mind\"\n\"Worried\"\n\"In Pieces\"\n\"Cheatback\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nChlöe: vocals \nBrandi Singleton: drums \nKyla Wright: bass\nElise Solberg: keys\nTaylor Gamble: guitar\nArnetta Johnson: trumpet\nCameron Johnson: trumpet\nDerek Dixie: musical direction, drum pad\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Suraya Mohamed \nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Keren Carrión, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Kwesi Lee\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Team: Joshua Bryant, Hazel Cills \nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #chloe","title":"Chlöe: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1152,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIeqO2tyhcY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oIeqO2tyhcY/hqdefault.jpg?v=64f2327a","content":{"View count":278830}}
{"description":"The Exorcist: Believer\nOnly in Theaters October 6\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.  \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar® nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own. \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia O’Neill), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil. \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar® winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before.\n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid’s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela’s neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela’s friend. \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award® nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.  \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty. \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment. \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Yücer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures. \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever","title":"The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer 2","duration":159,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230905","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSGeC880CYw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/rSGeC880CYw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2084211}}

{"description":"How Solar Power Got So Cheap … So Fast. Order yourself a LARQ Swig Top Bottle to go plastic free and enjoy ice cold water throughout the entire day.  https://bylarq.com/undecided3 CODE: MATT10. The growth of solar energy has exploded in the past few years. According to Our World in Data, solar power’s share of global electricity production jumped from 0.15% percent in 2010 to over 4.52% in 2022. This has left even the most optimistic solar energy adoption predictions in the dust. And everyone from skeptical naysayers to the loudest cheerleaders have been taken by surprise. In a 2012 Harvard Business School paper, researchers referred to solar energy as “the most expensive renewable energy.” Compare that to about a decade later where we’re entering solar power’s “terawatt age.” The sun is now widely regarded as the cheapest way to generate electricity. If there were ever a time to get in on solar panels, it would be now.\n\nCheck out Why Solar Panels Aren’t Unfair or a Scam https://youtu.be/dPfpa2KqYk0\n\nWatch Why Are Floating Wind Turbines So Huge? https://youtu.be/83FqqfODmmg?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/how-solar-power-got-so-cheap-so-fast/\n\nGet my achieve energy security with solar guide: \nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/solar-guide\n\nFollow-up podcast:\nVideo version - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-aWB84Bupf5hxGqrwYqLA\nAudio version - http://bit.ly/stilltbdfm\n\nJoin the Undecided Discord server:\nhttps://geni.us/undecided-discord\n\n👋 Support Undecided on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mattferrell\n\n\n⚙️ Gear & Products I Like\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/shop/\n\nGreat sustainable products for your home:\nhttps://geni.us/buildwithrise\n\nVisit my Energysage Portal:\nResearch solar panels and get quotes for free!\nhttp://www.energysage.com/p/undecided/\n\nOr find community solar near you:\nhttps://communitysolar.energysage.com/?rc=p-undecided\n\nFor a curated solar buying experience\nEnergyPal's free personalized quotes:\nhttps://energypal.com/undecided\n\nTesla Referral Code:\nGet 1,000 free supercharging miles \nor a discount on Tesla Solar & Powerwalls\nhttps://ts.la/matthew84515\n\n\n👉 Follow Me\nMastodon\nhttps://mastodon.social/@mattferrell\n\nTwitter \nhttps://twitter.com/mattferrell\nhttps://twitter.com/undecidedMF\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mattferrell\nhttps://www.instagram.com/undecidedmf\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/undecidedMF/\n\nWebsite\nhttps://undecidedmf.com\n\n\n📺 YouTube Tools I Recommend\nAudio file(s) provided by Epidemic Sound\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedEpidemic\n\nTubeBuddy\nhttps://www.tubebuddy.com/undecided\n\nVidIQ\nhttps://vidiq.com/undecided\n\n\nI may earn a small commission for my endorsement or recommendation to products or services linked above, but I wouldn't put them here if I didn't like them.

{"description":"Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances – either side if the interval – and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

{"description":"Hey guys! Today is another episode from my series Thrift Store Makeovers, where I take a used, worn out item (OR sometimes from yard sales or  off of ebay) clean it up, fix it up and decorate it.

{"description":"Meet the updated Tesla Model 3! \n\nIt’s been 7 years since the Model 3 was first unveiled, and this is the biggest design overhaul yet! The question is, how much has changed? Well, Mat’s got hands-on with the car to take a closer look. \n\nIn terms of the design, there are a few notable changes. Up top, there are a pair of slimmer, sleeker headlights, and there’s also a big central vent as part of the bumper. This helps give it a more aggressive look compared to the previous model. The side profile remains pretty similar to before, apart from a set of new alloy wheel designs. Around the back, the Model 3 comes with updated taillights and a new bumper. The car is also available in a couple of new, exclusive paint colours! \n\nOn the inside, the look and feel are still pretty similar to before, but there are a couple of notable differences. While the large landscape infotainment screen remains, the dash around it has been updated, with new LED lights added to it. There a better quality materials to be found throughout the cabin compared to before, and the infotainment system has been updated and is much quicker and more responsive than before. The indicator buttons have now also been integrated into the steering wheel. \n\nWhen it comes to performance, the Model 3 still comes with a single-motor RWD edition and a dual-motor long-range edition. However, aerodynamic improvements and overall performance updates mean the car can now travel further, with the single-motor RWD having a range of 346 miles, while the dual-motor can travel for up to 423 miles! \n\nThe new Model 3 won’t be released in the UK until next year, but thankfully, the price is set to stay pretty similar to before - so you can expect entry-level models to cost around £42,000. But will it be worth the wait? You’ll need to stick with Mat and see for yourself!\n\nConfigure a Tesla Model 3 with carwow: https://bit.ly/Configure-A-Model-3\n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n00:27 Design\n01:50 Interior\n02:45 Noise\n03:45 Suspension\n04:21 Infotainment\n05:36 Back Seats\n06:15 Efficiency\n06:47 Range\n07:02 Price & Release\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"New Tesla Model 3 - what's changed?","duration":481,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230901","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ6zIHHMlSs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gQ6zIHHMlSs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1918364}}

Kandi’s sights are set on gaining EGOT status as a two-time Broadway producer, actress, singer, and now podcast host. With several business moves on the horizon, she’s trying to balance prioritizing family time with supporting her husband and business partner, Todd, in his journey to Hollywood as a filmmaker… just as he always supports her. Will Kandi be able to put in the time and energy needed to help Todd and achieve her future aspirations? Kenya is in full boss mode. The hair-care mogul is taking her business to the next level by opening her very own hair salon. While Kenya is still having fun as she twirls her way back into the dating world, the one lingering issue is the finalizing of her divorce. Shereé is stepping into her greatness after suffering public humiliation when her last relationship didn’t go as planned. But she didn’t let that get in the way of giving love a second chance with the new man in her life, Martell Holt. However, as she faces an unexpected health issue, she will have to shift all her focus. Will there be enough Shereé to go around? Drew is taking her music career to new octaves by releasing her first album, pushing forward her acting and music career simultaneously while also working through her relationship with her husband, Ralph. But they strike the wrong chord in their marriage, and their divorce announcement leaves everyone shaken. As Marlo continues to take on her role as “Munty,” she’s working with a life coach while raising teenagers who are ready for summer jobs and driving lessons. She also takes a dip in the dating pool while she looks for her next suitor—but not without the approval of her nephews. Returning for her sophomore season, Sanya has no plans to slow down and has her sights set on expanding her business and family. Sanya and husband Aaron still have a full house of nine, all with their own set of challenges. As Sanya navigates the great expectations for her family, business, and more of herself, is she running a marathon with no end in sight? Friend Monyetta is back in the mix playing matchmaker when she introduces Kenya to a new love interest. Monyetta is trying to be a good friend while managing the tough waters of being loyal to Kandi while showing the other ladies she can be true to them as well. Courtney also joins this season as a friend. She’s a successful brand marketing expert and jewelry designer in Atlanta who has been friends with Shereé for many years. Courtney realizes her strong ties to this group when she finds out her long-lost cousin is Drew’s husband, Ralph. However, with friendships on the brink, accusations causing a fuss, and divorce news that’s all too much, will these women be able to channel positive vibes?\n\nCast:\nKandi Burruss\nKenya Moore\nShereé Whitfield\nDrew Sidora\nMarlo Hampton\nSanya Richards-Ross\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

It was developed in America in the 1970's by George Wright and gets it's name from the Phoenix workshops. It is classified as a downdraft kiln because the flames go up into the ware chamber and then down to the exit flue of the ware chambers before going up a chimney. I built one from mud to learn about how it works and to see how hot it gets. \nThe mud I used for the kiln is white clay from a flood area and it less than ideal for making pottery. I tested it and it worked ok but I knocked out the exit flue wall to make it behave more like a cross draft kiln before firing the pots. The kiln worked well in firing pottery despite the poor quality clay which cracked easily. If run for longer it probably would have reached higher temperatures. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Today I let the intrusive thoughts win and melted together every bar of soap sold at Whole Foods…yes, that’s right - not even Whole Foods is safe from some ~mad franken-science~.\n\nSo we bought 109 bars from 23 different brands - and shredded them all down to tiny little cheese shreds, and then used a \"rebatching\" technique to create one singular & striped franken-bar. The process was long and grueling, but it was definitely worth it in the end since our final franken-bars ended up so cute!! What do you guys think of our final product? And since we've tackled both Lush and Whole Foods soaps now, whose soaps do you want to see us demolish next??? \n\nBig thank you to both Katie at Royalty Soaps & Anne-Marie at Bramble Berry for their expert opinions on our franken-soap!!

{"description":"OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH is based (very) loosely on the true adventures of 18th century would-be pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby). After trading the seemingly charmed life of a gentleman for one of a swashbuckling buccaneer, Stede became captain of the pirate ship Revenge. Struggling to earn the respect of his potentially mutinous crew, Stede’s fortunes changed after a fateful run-in with the infamous Captain Blackbeard (Taika Waititi). To their surprise, the wildly different Stede and Blackbeard found more than friendship on the high seas…they found love. Now, they have to survive it.\n\nSeason 2 of OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH premieres October 5, only on Max.\n\nAbout Max:\nMax is the culture-defining entertainment service for every mood.

{"description":"Starfield reviewed on PC and Xbox Series X by Dan Stapleton.\nIt’s never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours, but that’s very much the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it. There are a lot of forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management, and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive. I’m glad that I powered through the early hours, because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got rolling, combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I’d finished the main story after around 60 hours. Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there’s still an immense amount of quality roleplaying quests and interesting NPCs out there, waiting to be stumbled across, and the pull to seek it out is strong.","title":"Starfield Review","duration":742,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMMNkfSQuiU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/nMMNkfSQuiU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1849337}}

{"description":"Tropical Storm Idalia descended on the Carolinas on its way out to the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday, leaving a trail of flooding and destruction throughout the Southeast that stretched back to its landfall as a hurricane in Florida.\n\nRescue and repair efforts continued in the areas the storm passed Wednesday and there was no immediate word on the toll from the ferocious winds and inundating waters, but authorities counted at least one death.\n\nThe storm left as many as a half-million customers without power in Florida and other states at one point as it ripped down power poles and lines. Still, it was far less destructive than feared, providing only glancing blows to Tampa Bay and other more populated areas as it came ashore with 125 mph (201 kph) winds in rural Florida.\n\nThe weakening storm still packed winds of up to 60 mph (96 kph) as it blasted through Georgia and South Carolina on Wednesday evening. It was expected to reach the North Carolina coast Thursday and roll off into the ocean through the weekend.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who declared a statewide emergency earlier this week as Idalia approached, had warned residents in coastal and eastern inland counties to prepare for heavy rainfall and localized flooding and urged them to stay off roads covered by water.\n\nIn South Carolina, the storm coupled with king tides to send seawater flowing over sand dunes and spilling onto beachfront streets. In Charleston, a surge from Idalia topped the seawall that protects the downtown, sending ankle-deep ocean water into the streets and neighborhoods where horse-drawn carriages pass million-dollar homes and the famous open-air market.\n\nPreliminary data showed the Wednesday evening high tide reached just over 9.2 feet (2.8 meters), more than 3 feet (0.9 meters) above normal and the fifth-highest reading in Charleston Harbor since records were first kept in 1899.\n\nBands from Idalia also brought short-lived tornadoes. One flipped a car in suburban Goose Creek, South Carolina, causing minor injuries, authorities said. No major damage was reported.\n\nAfter traveling across the Gulf of Mexico, Idalia came ashore Wednesday morning near Keaton Beach, pummeling Florida’s remote and lightly populated Big Bend region with powerful winds.\n\nThe area, where the Florida Panhandle curves into the peninsula, saw streets turned into rivers that submerged cars and homes, while the howling winds tore off roofs, snapped tall trees, sent sheet metal flying and shredded homes.\n\n“All hell broke loose,” said Belond Thomas of Perry, a mill town located just inland from the Big Bend region. Thomas fled with her family and some friends to a motel, thinking it would be safer than riding out the storm at home but the roof was torn away and debris showered onto her pregnant daughter, who fortunately wasn’t injured, Thomas said.\n\nNo hurricane-related deaths were officially confirmed in Florida, but the state's highway patrol reported two people killed in separate weather-related crashes just hours before Idalia made landfall.\n\nEven so, Idalia appeared to be far less destructive than first feared. It avoided large urban regions, striking only glancing blows to Tampa Bay and other more populated areas while focusing its fury on the rural Big Bend section.\n\nHowever, damage there was likely to be extensive.\n\nAt Horseshoe Beach in central Big Bend, Jewell Baggett picked through the wreckage and debris of her mother’s destroyed home, finding a few pictures and her mother’s pots and pans.\n\nHer grandfather built the home decades ago and it had survived four previous storms, she said.\n\n“And now it’s gone,” she said. “Nothing left. A few little trinkets here and there.”\n\nBaggett, whose mother had left before the storm hit, said at least five or six other homes also were destroyed.\n\nIn Tallahassee, the power went out well before the center of the storm arrived, but the city avoided a direct hit. A giant oak tree next to the governor’s mansion split in half, covering the yard with debris.\n\nState officials, 5,500 National Guardsman and rescue crews went into search-and-recovery mode, inspecting bridges, clearing toppled trees and looking for anyone in distress. More than 30,000 utility workers gathered to repair downed power lines and poles.\n\nREAD MORE: https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/tropical-storm-idalia-north-carolina/507-6ab5b730-ea2a-4c37-93e0-48fc677b55ff","title":"Hurricane Idalia devastation seen across social media","duration":149,"channel_id":"UCcT6w3xUyVshyR2_2vrMp1w","author":"WUSA9","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4NclqJ87QQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4NclqJ87QQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":605863}}

{"description":"The council of Madden Youtubers gathered once again, after seeing the historic launch of the Wheel of MUT Madden 24 season opener. They shifted nervously as MMG entered the room, until one member finally spoke up, \"Papa Meags... we beg of you. STOP posting WOM. Our audiences expect far too much of us now, when they put our content side by side. We simply cannot compete.\" MMG could only smile. He stood proudly, and spoke, \"Fear not, my fellow Youtubers. One day, I will retire from the game, and you are free to put out mediocre content as long as you please. But today... is not that day.\" And thus, another S+ tier season of WOM was born. Rejoice, gentlemen.
