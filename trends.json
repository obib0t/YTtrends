{"description":"Richmond Till We Die. Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso\n\nIn this third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them as last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.\n\nSong: “I Still Believe” by Frank Turner https://apple.co/IStillBelieve_FrankTurner \n\nAudio Description Version available: https://apple.co/TedLasso-\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Ted Lasso:\nhttps://twitter.com/TedLasso\n\nFollow AFC Richmond:\nhttps://twitter.com/AFCRichmond\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple TV+\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTVPlus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTVPlus\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

{"description":"On June 16, worlds collide. Watch the official trailer now for The Flash – only in theaters. #TheFlashMovie \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n“The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).\n\n“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers \nare Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch \n(“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023.","title":"The Flash – Official Trailer","duration":176,"channel_id":"UCiifkYAs_bq1pt_zbNAzYGg","author":"DC","date":"20230212","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vwaD9cHLNw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vwaD9cHLNw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4680650}}

{"description":"The end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga\n\n#FASTX","title":"FAST X | Official Trailer","duration":222,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32RAq6JzY-w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32RAq6JzY-w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":31964258}}

{"description":"Bailey Zimmerman - Fix'n To Break (Lyric Video)\n\n📱 Text me - 618.228.3400 or click the link https://my.community.com/baileyzimmerman\n\nFollow Bailey on Socials!\nhttp://www.tiktok.com/@bailey.zimmerman?\nhttp://facebook.com/baileyzimmermanmusic\nhttp://instagram.com/bailey.zimmerman\nhttp://twitter.com/baileyzimmerman\n\nEstablishing himself as one of music’s most exciting new voices, Bailey Zimmerman strikes a sweet spot between timeless American country, rafter-rattling arena rock, and authentic storytelling. It’s why in just one year’s time, he’s already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80’s hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song “Never Comin’ Home” amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, “Fall In Love”, “Rock and A Hard Place”, and “Where It Ends”. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n© 2023 Warner Music Nashville LLC / 2023 Elektra Records\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #FixnToBreak #TikTok","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Fix'n To Break (Lyric Video)","duration":231,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhxEO5I-BCQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lhxEO5I-BCQ/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":270554}}

{"description":"Turquía es un país de terremotos, pero Italia, Grecia y los Balcanes también. Solo desde el año 2000, en la península de Anatólia se han registrado 18 terremotos por encima del grado 5 de magnitud. En Italia central, entre 2009 y 2016, se han registrado tres terremotos que han arrasado sus respectivas comarcas.\n\n¿Pero por qué en la región del Mediterráneo hay tantos terremotos? La razón es que en esta zona se encuentran los bordes de contacto de tres placas tectónicas. La placa euroasiática, la arábiga y la africana. En este vídeo explicativo veremos como a placas africana y arábiga están empujando hacia la placa euroasiática. Estos movimientos de las capas profunda de la Tierra provocan que una placa se monte por encima de la otra, provocando los terremotos y la formación de los Alpes y los Pirineos.\n\nDesde el sur, la costa de África se mueve empujando las Baleares, Córcega y Cerdeña contra Italia. Al otro lado, la placa arábiga también se separa de África y empuja hacia norte, creando las montañas del Cáucaso. Este empuje no se acabará hasta que el Mediterráneo no se haya cerrado por el desplazamiento conjunto de la placa africana y arábiga.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:29 ¿Por qué hay tantos terremotos en el Mediterráneo?\n02:14 Así está hecho el interior de la Tierra\n04:50 El futuro del Mediterráneo\n06:14 El planeta en 50 millones de años\n07:10 La gramática de los terremotos\n\n#terremotos #turquia #mediterraneo","title":"El terremoto de Turquía es una montaña que está naciendo en el Mediterráneo","duration":494,"channel_id":"UCY2hu_NT5NDbBU-HGxgqMuA","author":"El Confidencial","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzdXgo2J_dc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/BzdXgo2J_dc/hqdefault.webp?v=63e67001","content":{"View count":1824851}}

When it’s no longer Sonic AND Knuckles, and just Knux by himself… well, it becomes Sonic vs Knuckles… at least in the dreadlocked tough guy’s head.\n\nAt least Tails is here to try and give The Red Dude a bit of a pep talk. After all, what are friends for? And that pep talk is necessary, because there’s a massive Sonic boom coming in the form of a ginormous kaiju. So, unless Mr. Guardian can become Super Knuckles, and eliminate the Sonic prime threat, this civilisation is done for. There’s Something About Knuckles… and that something better be courage.\n\nProduced by Tom Jenkins and Ben Michael\nWritten by Jason Dewey and Ben Michael\n\nPre-production by \nWonchop (http://youtube.com/WonchopAnimation),\nLiam McKeown\n\nRough Animation by \nWonchop,\nLiam McKeown,\nEsau \"LDranzer\" A.

{"description":"In the early hours of 06 February 2023, south eastern Turkey and northern areas of Syria were hit by a powerful and destructive quake. A second one followed only hours later, as well as a series of after shocks. Far away to the west, Istanbul was unaffected; but Turkey’s largest metropolis, lies close to the North Anatolian Fault Zone, one of the most active in the world. Seismologists say the city could be hit at anytime as this documentary, shot in 2019, illustrates. \n\nMarco Bohnhoff is from the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. We accompany him and his team on their way to the Princes Islands in the Sea of Marmara just to the south of Istanbul. With the help of several measuring stations, the scientist wants to develop a new type of early warning system for earthquakes in the region. In a best case scenario, it would send warning signals hours or even days in advance. The Anatolian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet directly below the Sea of Marmara, making the risk of earthquakes particularly high. In the case of a big tremor, Turkish disaster management authorities forecast at least 80,000 deaths. In the last few years, the city has been trying to become more earthquake-resistant, for example by tightening building regulations. However, the Chamber of Civil Engineers is skeptical, with chairman Cemal Gökce stressing: Not everything that is new is earthquake-proof. Seismologists such as Marco Bohnhoff, as well as disaster prevention experts and engineers, are working flat out to prepare Istanbul for future natural disasters by constructing special buildings and improving forecasting. \n\n[This documentary was filmed in 2019.] \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Rory McIlroy is making his first PGA TOUR start since winning THE CJ CUP in South Carolina in October. McIlroy has, however, played five times on the DP World Tour since that win, recording five top-5 finishes, including a win at the Hero Dubai Desert Classic. Eight of the world’s top-10 golfers are in the field, including world No. 2 Scottie Scheffler and world No. 3 Jon Rahm. Rahm currently leads in the FedExCup Standings and has won four of his last six starts combined on the PGA TOUR and DP World Tour. Meanwhile, Scheffler is looking to become the first golfer since Hideki Matsuyama (2016-17) to win back-to-back titles at TPC Scottsdale. Sam Ryder returns to TPC Scottsdale after making a hole-in-one on the famous 16th hole in 2022. Other names to look out for include Shane Lowry, Collin Morikawa and Patrick Cantlay, who returns after a playoff loss last season.  \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Highlights | Round 1 | WM Phoenix Open | 2023","duration":856,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20230210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfY6Ypdr6Xo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lfY6Ypdr6Xo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":345680}}

{"description":"From clothes to tech, why is everything so poorly made?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nMaybe you’ve noticed: In the past 10 years everything we buy from clothes to technology has gotten just a little bit worse. Sweaters are more likely to tear. Phones are more likely to break. Smart toasters and TVs burn out and die after only a few years. It might seem like consumer products just aren’t built to last anymore. What’s going on?\n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately!), part of the problem is us. For decades, we’ve been conditioned to buy, buy, buy, and today it’s normal for many consumers to shop for new clothes at least once a month. In order to keep up, many companies have to prioritize making things in the fastest and least expensive way possible. To do that, they cut corners with materials and labor. In turn, quality suffers, which leaves consumers with a lot of crappy things.\n\nThe story with technology is a little different. And the biggest difference is that while no one in fashion is saying you’re not allowed to sew a new button on a shirt, many tech companies have actually made it impossible to repair their products. \n\nThe good news is consumers have a surprising amount of control over this situation. Watch the video to learn more.\n\n\nCheck out the original article from Izzie Ramirez on Vox.com: https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23529587/consumer-goods-quality-fast-fashion-technology\n\nRepair.org is Gay Gordon Byrne’s association that’s fighting for your right to repair. \n\nFor more on the right to repair bill in New York State there are some articles here:\nhttps://www.engadget.com/new-york-right-to-repair-law-kathy-hochul-184654713.html\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2022/12/29/23530733/right-to-repair-law-new-york-tech-hochul-oems-parts\n\nWhile I didn’t spend much time on Fast Fashion for this piece, I did love these articles:\nhttps://catapult.co/stories/haley-e-d-houseman-clothing-costs-labor-materials-handmade-homemade-factory-made\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/fast-cheap-out-of-control-inside-rise-of-shein/\n\nThis article from Vogue did a great job breaking down what things actually costs:\nhttps://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-the-right-price-for-fashion\n\nI also highly recommend following Cora Harrington (@lingerie_addict) and Derek Guy (@dieworkwear) on twitter for more hot takes on the fashion industry. \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"They’re bad to the bone. Watch the #StraysMovie NSFW trailer now. In Theaters June 9th.\n\nhttps://www.strays.movie/ \n\nThey say a dog is a man’s best friend, but what if the man is a total dirtbag? In that case, it might be time for some sweet revenge, doggy style. \n\nWhen Reggie (Will Ferrell), a naïve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte; The Last Man on Earth, Nebraska), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose. \n\nBut once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Oscar® winner Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is. \n \nDetermined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug’s pals—Maggie (Isla Fisher; Now You See Me, Wedding Crashers), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner’s new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park; Always Be My Maybe, Aquaman), an anxious Great Dane who’s stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal—together hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home … and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. (Hint: It’s not his foot). \n\nA subversion of the dog movies we know and love, Strays, directed by Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) and written by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal), is a hilarious, R-rated, live-action comedy about the complications of love, the importance of great friendships, and the unexpected virtues of couch humping. \n\nFeaturing a powerhouse comedic supporting cast—including Grammy winner Josh Gad (Beauty and the Beast), Harvey Guillén (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish), Emmy nominee Rob Riggle (The Hangover), Brett Gelman (Stranger Things), Jamie Demetriou (The Afterparty), and Emmy nominee Sofia Vergara (Modern Family)—Strays is produced by Picturestart founder and CEO Erik Feig (Luckiest Girl Alive, Cha Cha Real Smooth), by Louis Leterrier (director Fast X, The Clash of the Titans), by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal) and by Lord Miller partners Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) and Lord Miller President of Film Aditya Sood (The Martian, Cocaine Bear). \n \nThe film is executive produced by Jessica Switch, Nikki Baida and Julia Hammer.","title":"Strays | Official Trailer [HD]","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230208","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwOLKTbCUw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/BzwOLKTbCUw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":477345}}
