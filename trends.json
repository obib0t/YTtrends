{"description":"Tipping in the United States is on the rise and experts are calling it tipflation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the number of tips provided at full-service restaurants grew by 17% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Meanwhile the tip frequency at quick-service restaurants rose 16% during the same time period. Experts say that's because of the newer and sleeker-looking Point-of-Sale, or POS, systems by tech companies like Square, Toast and Clover, who also have increased their sales as a result. The pressure to tip well in front of the tip receiver, before a service is completed, or in front of other customers makes a difference for many. After customers swipe their credit card, they're typically prompted with three large tipping options on a screen. While businesses can opt out of the tipping feature, most aren't. In fact, even Starbucks started prompting customers for tips in stores in September 2022. With Americans being pressured to tip higher percentages and for more services, the question is, where is the tipping point?\n\nChapters: \n00:00 ‚Äî Introduction \n02:25 ‚Äî Why we tip \n04:09 ‚Äî Tipping in 2023\n05:45 ‚Äî Big Tech\n09:14 ‚Äî Tipping point\n\nProduced by: Emily Lorsch\nEdited by: Jacob Harrell\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nGraphics by: Midnight Snacks\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC:¬†https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV:¬†https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

It is, inevitably, a plug-in hybrid, but it‚Äôs one that takes the possibilities of the format and does wild and wonderful things with it. \n\nWe‚Äôre talking a naturally aspirated 6.5-litre V12, aided by three electric motors, two of which are mounted on the front axle, the third integrated into the new eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. \n\nAll of that means the Revuelto is good for a total power output of 1,001bhp, a top speed of 217mph and 0-62mph in just 2.5 seconds.

{"description":"This Summer, meet the residents of Element City\n\nWatch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar‚Äôs #Elemental and see the movie in 3D, only in theaters June 16!\n\nCheck out a brand-new trailer for Disney and Pixar‚Äôs ‚ÄúElemental,‚Äù an all-new original feature film that transports moviegoers to an extraordinary place called Element City, where a host of elements live and work. The trailer showcases each element‚Äîair, earth, water and fire‚Äîand what sets them apart according to Ember, a quick-witted and fiery woman who‚Äôs always stayed close to home in Firetown. In ‚ÄúElemental,‚Äù which opens in theaters on June 16, she finally ventures out of her comfort zone to explore this spectacular world born from the imaginations of Pixar‚Äôs filmmakers and specifically crafted for the big-screen experience. Element City is inspired by big cities around the globe and embraces theorized contributions from each elemental community‚Äîfrom giant pine-tree-like buildings and waterfall skyscrapers to a tornado-shaped arena called Cyclone Stadium. \n\nJoining the previously announced voice cast including Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as Ember and Wade, respectively, are Ronnie del Carmen as Ember‚Äôs soon-to-be retired dad, Bernie; Shila Ommi as Ember‚Äôs love-seeking mom, Cinder; Wendi McLendon-Covey as Wade‚Äôs stormy and Air-Ball-loving boss, Gale; Catherine O‚ÄôHara as Wade‚Äôs welcoming mom, Brook; Mason Wertheimer as Ember‚Äôs admiring earth neighbor, Clod; and Joe Pera as an overgrown city bureaucrat, Fern.\n \nDirected by Peter Sohn, produced by Denise Ream, p.g.a., and executive produced by Pete Docter, ‚ÄúElemental‚Äù features a screenplay by John Hoberg & Kat Likkel and Brenda Hsueh with story by Sohn, Hoberg & Likkel and Hsueh. The film‚Äôs original score was composed and conducted by Thomas Newman. \n\r\nPixar Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixar/\r\nPixar Twitter: https://twitter.com/pixar\r\nPixar Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pixar\r\n \r\nCopyright: (C) Disney‚Ä¢Pixar","title":"Elemental | Official Trailer","duration":139,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20230328","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXzcyx9V0xw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hXzcyx9V0xw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":6036785}}

{"description":"Watch the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor celebrating Adam Sandler on CNN.com or CNNgo.\n\nhttps://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nThe Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize, which is named to honor one of the world‚Äôs greatest humorists, was awarded to Adam Sandler at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy -- including Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Ben Stiller, Dana Carvey, Pete Davidson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Anniston, Idina Menzel, David Spade, and more -- on March 19, 2023, and aired nationally on CNN on March 26, 2023.\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\n‚ÄúAdam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,‚Äù said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year‚Äôs recipient. ‚ÄúAdam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to bring together the best in comedy.‚Äù\n\n#MarkTwainPrize #AdamSandler #kennedycenter #cnn \n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Adam Sandler Acceptance Speech | 2023 Mark Twain Prize","duration":692,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20230327","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CukbxgucLc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5CukbxgucLc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2391787}}

{"description":"And why that‚Äôs a big deal.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nFor the first time in six decades, China‚Äôs population is shrinking, and it‚Äôs predicted it could create a demographic crisis. That‚Äôs because China isn‚Äôt just shrinking, it‚Äôs also aging. And the majority of Chinese couples are not considering having more than one child. Because of this, China is predicted to lose nearly 50 percent of its population by 2100. \n\nChina‚Äôs population decline can be traced back to the restrictive family-planning policies launched in the 1970s and an impressive economic boom fueled by China‚Äôs huge labor force. \nChina‚Äôs modernization brought rapid urbanization, rising income levels, and better education to large parts of China. Combined, these policies and growth have given China one of the lowest birth rates in the world. \n\nToday, China is trying to reverse its population decline. Not just because an aging population is hard to sustain economically, but because China‚Äôs impressive economic growth, until now, has relied on its people. As China‚Äôs population challenges deepen over time, it might have to rethink how to grow its economy and care for its citizens. \n\nYou can explore China‚Äôs birth and death rate data via the United Nations Population portal, here:\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/MORT/Deaths/156\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/FERT/Births/156\n\nAs well as the country‚Äôs total population and predictions here:\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/156\n\nHere are some key facts about China‚Äôs declining population from Pew Research:\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/05/key-facts-about-chinas-declining-population/\n\nYou can read some surprising details about China‚Äôs family planning policies ‚Äî for example,  the One-Child Policy was actually less impactful than the Later, Longer, Fewer campaign ‚Äî here: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/martinwhyte/files/challenging_myths_published_version.pdf\n\nHere‚Äôs an overview of China‚Äôs economic development from the World Bank:\nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview\n\nAnd a report on China‚Äôs income gap:\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/china-income-gap-rural-urban\n\nFor an in-depth look at the cruelty and human cost of China‚Äôs One-Child policy, I recommend the documentary One Child Nation by Nanfu Wang:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/independentlens/documentaries/one-child-nation/\n\nYou can explore population pyramids from across the world on the US Census Bureau‚Äôs website:\nhttps://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/country?COUNTRY_YEAR=2023&COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2023\n \nFinally, our expert, Professor Wang Feng, believes China‚Äôs population growth can be framed in a positive light. To understand how, read this piece he wrote for the New York Times:\nhttps://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2023/02/01/wang-feng-optimistic-alternative/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Undefeated two-time super middleweight world champion David ‚ÄúThe Mexican Monster‚Äù Benavidez retained his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title with a bruising unanimous decision victory over former world champion Caleb Plant in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions. The judges‚Äô final tallies were 117-111, 116-112 and 115-113.\n \nThe highly anticipated showdown between super middleweight rivals turned into the intriguing clash of styles that many predicted it would be, as Plant‚Äôs boxing acumen carried the early action until the brute force and high-volume power punching of Benavidez took over. After 12 grueling rounds in front of a sold out arena, the two fighters squashed their years long beef, embracing and expressing their mutual respect.\n\n‚ÄúI know there was a lot said between us but in the end we settled this like men,‚Äù said Benavidez. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy we gave the fans the best rivalry of the year or the last five years. I‚Äôm just very happy.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big rivalry but that‚Äôs what boxing is all about,‚Äù said Plant. ‚ÄúWe came here and settled it like men. I take nothing from David. We haven‚Äôt been the best of friends but we got into the ring and we settled it like men. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do. He‚Äôs a helluva fighter.‚Äù\n \nAccording to CompuBox, Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) held a large advantage in power punches landed (180-68) but also out-landed Plant in jabs (30-23). Plant (22-2, 13 KOs) was the busier fighter, throwing 624 to Benavidez‚Äôs 551, but was unable to deter the late round onslaught from Benavidez.\n \n‚ÄúI knew I had to take it step by step and round by round,‚Äù said Benavidez. ‚ÄúCaleb is a tough fighter. He‚Äôs not going to give you everything in the first few rounds so you have to find him. But I feel like I didn‚Äôt just show that I was a power puncher tonight. I showed that I had defense and head movement and I was able to move around the ring and cut the ring off really good.‚Äù\n \nPlant‚Äôs movement appeared to give Benavidez trouble throughout the early action, as Plant consistently landed two to three punch combinations and escape Benavidez‚Äôs counters. It wasn‚Äôt until round eight that Plant‚Äôs movement began to slow down and his attempts at holding were increasingly thwarted.\n \n‚ÄúI was trying to hold him when necessary, punch him when necessary, and throw my combinations when necessary,‚Äù said Plant. ‚ÄúBut when the best get in there with the best, you roll the dice and someone is going to come out with their hand raised and someone will come up short. And one thing that I pride myself on is that I roll with the best in the world. I haven‚Äôt ducked anyone and maybe we can have a rematch in the future.‚Äù\n \nAs the fight moved into the championship rounds, Benavidez pushed forward more aggressively, busting Plant‚Äôs nose and peppering him with short hooks from all angles. Plant stayed on his feet for the final bell, but his final attempts to turn the tide were thwarted by Benavidez. Asked post fight about his future plans, Benavidez set his sights squarely on undisputed 168-pound champion Canelo Alvarez.\n \n‚ÄúI just want to tell everyone that I have a lot of respect for Canelo Alvarez but he has to give me that shot now,‚Äù said Benavidez. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what everyone wants to see. Let‚Äôs make it happen.\nNow the fans are calling for this fight, the legends are calling for this fight, so let‚Äôs make it happen.‚Äù\n\n#DavidBenavidez #CalebPlant #BenavidezPlant\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Benavidez vs Plant HIGHLIGHTS: March 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":106,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20230326","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd74xRh5GQw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bd74xRh5GQw/hqdefault.jpg?v=64201ac7","content":{"View count":1153525}}

{"description":"Stacie shares her experience with tiny house living, including some important lessons learned about designing, financing, and finding a parking spot for a tiny house, all from the perspective of a former apartment dweller in the city who made the leap to move to a tiny home in a rural mobile home park.\n\nYou can follow and find out more about Stacie's tiny home experience here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@CasaDuroTinyHome\n\nStacie had her home custom-built and was able to pay a deposit and obtain a line of credit to cover the remainder of the cost.  In the video, she suggests saving in advance if possible, and she also mentions chattel loans, builder financing, and financing from the previous owner as other financial loan options to explore (since many lending institutions and banks might not issue a conventional mortgage for a tiny house on wheels).\n\nFor parking, Stacie wanted a legal setup and spent a lot of time following leads for parking her home on private land, but they often fell through because the municipality wouldn't approve it, or because the landowners changed their minds.  At the last minute, she was able to find a spot to park it at a trailer park.  Since moving there she's had the chance to visit neighbouring trailers and wishes she had checked them out as an option before having a tiny home custom-built.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.

Vy and Daniel surprised me with balloons, streamers, a birthday cake, and Spider-man, when I returned home from cancer treatment (radiation). I was really happy and thanked them, but I told them that I can't have any more interruptions. I was about to start my phone call with Scholastic but suddenly a gorilla showed up in my backyard. He sang me happy birthday, told a number of cringy monkey jokes and was on his way. Later, in the middle of my meeting with Target, a donkey walked into my yard! I had to cut my meeting short and go outside to play with the donkey.

Dani Olmo scored the first goal for Spain with a flawless shot to the bottom tight corner assisted by Alejandro Balde. Norway wanted vengeance and had some great chances. After lots of back-and-forth chances, Joselu scored with a beautiful header into the left corner to extend Spain‚Äôs lead to 2-0 in his debut game. A minute later, Joselu scored again with a left-footed shot to the bottom right corner to extend Spain‚Äôs lead 3-0.
