{"description":"I’ve just disembarked what may be the shortest and weirdest cruise in history on a ship that was planned to be scrapped in 2020. She was saved from the scrapyard by a new British cruise line and I booked a 3 night mini break onboard the ship. \n \nOur cruise was cancelled 4 hours after we boarded and in total we were onboard this ship for about 8 hours, and during that time we had more problems than we would usually on a full two week cruise. The way that everything was handled was so bizarre I honestly think I’m still in shock. \n \nWe boarded the ship in London Tilbury and were planning on heading to Bruges to the Christmas markets. Embarkation was pretty easy and despite the bad weather we were really excited to get onboard. \n \nI picked up my cruise card which is the thing you use to get into your room, to buy drinks, pretty much everything onboard it’s very important. But my friends Justin and Tristan were told that they’d have to get theirs onboard as they weren’t ready yet, no big deal we thought, that isn’t uncommon on a cruise for things to be a bit delayed. The problem was much bigger than that but at this point we didn’t realise how widespread the problem was. \n \nAs soon as we embarked the ship we were in the middle of this beautiful Atrum, the ship was decorated for Christmas and looked amazing. Despite the ship being from 1991 everything here looked very new and I hoped that the rest of the ship would be as nice as this area. I didn’t have particularly high expectations after reading review after review online about broken toilets, broken air conditioning but this area definitely surpassed what I had expected. \n\nCruise Buoys Vlog: https://youtu.be/k8gPqPTbFgw\nSail Away With Dan and Jay Tour: https://youtu.be/XBCVVW75SGk\n \nOne of my favourite things about cruising is that feeling when you first get onboard a cruise ship and you run around exploring as fast as you can. Looking back I’m so glad that I did because I wouldn’t have a chance to later. We found a big pub area called The Purple Turtle which I’ve since found out used to be a casino. In the UK we don’t gamble as much as other places so if a British cruise line buys an American or Australian ship, they normally replace the big casino with one thats much smaller. \n \nThe ship was originally launched in 1991 for Princess cruises as Regal Princess and spent most of her life as Pacific Dawn for P&O Australia. As I was wandering around the main public areas I thought wow Ambassador have done a great job renovating these spaces, I’ve since had a look at P&O Dawn ship reviews and I think I should be giving a lot of the credit to P&O instead of Ambassador because most of the inside spaces haven’t changed, even the picture frames are the same in the big lounges. Not that that’s a bad thing, they didn’t need to be changed, P&O did a great job with these areas when they refit the ship back in 2017. \n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to exclusive perks like a weekly podcast and early ad free access to videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu4C8c3h9SKdkxnOwIAiHeA/join\n\n▶ Weekly Updates: http://EmmaCruises.com/News\n▶ Book a Cruise: https://EmmaCruises.com/Book-a-Cruise/\n\nLet’s Connect! \n▶ https://EmmaCruises.com/SocialLinks\n\n*** \n▶  Background World Map: https://emmacruises.com/map (Affiliate link)\n\nemma@emmacruises.com","title":"Our Cruise Was CANCELLED After 4 Hours Onboard","duration":779,"channel_id":"UCu4C8c3h9SKdkxnOwIAiHeA","author":"Emma Cruises","date":"20221220","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jppzHpO_8xU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jppzHpO_8xU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":586506}}

But it does obligate the planners and engineers involved in rebuilding to be thoughtful about the impacts hurricanes can have and how infrastructure can be made more resilient to them in the future.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Oppenheimer - Only In Theaters 7 21 23\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. \n \nThe film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. Oscar® winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award® nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar® winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar® nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\nOppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography. \n\nNolan’s films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations. \n\nSocial Handles:\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/oppenheimermovie    \nTW: https://www.twitter.com/@oppenheimerfilm  \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OppenheimerMovie \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/OppenheimerMovie/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/oppenheimermovie\nWebsite: https://www.OppenheimerMovie.com   \n#Oppenheimer","title":"Oppenheimer | Official Trailer","duration":123,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20221219","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6ldnjE3Y0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/bK6ldnjE3Y0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":21967381}}

{"description":"A major winter storm is expected to develop in the days leading up to Christmas. Behind the storm a massive chunk of Arctic air will plunge into the lower 48 giving some the coldest air they have felt in years. Travel could be significantly impacted for the holiday.\n\nThe highest impacts when it comes to the snow will be in the Great Lakes Region and Midwest.\n\nSome places, especially along and around the Great Lakes could pick up more than a foot. Areas in parts of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin could see near-blizzard conditions as the storm gets stronger Thursday night into Friday.\n\nThings quiet down for Christmas Eve, but the chill settles in all the way down to Florida. Miami could fall into the 30s and Orlando could dip below freezing.\n\nThe only place to escape the Arctic chill is the Desert Southwest and Southern California. Or The Caribbean :)\n\nSubscribe to @News6WKMG for more updates!","title":"UPDATE!

{"description":"Argentines celebrate on Sunday that their hero Lionel Messi’s once-in-a-generation career is complete. The Argentina superstar is finally a World Cup champion.\n\nMessi scored two goals and then another in a shootout as Argentina beat France 4-2 on penalties Sunday to claim a third World Cup title despite Kylian Mbappé scoring the first hat trick in a final in 56 years.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, fans cheered, cried, hugged and waved the Argentina flag as they gathered to watch the match.\n\nMessi is definitively in the pantheon of soccer’s greatest ever players, alongside Pelé — a record three-time World Cup champion from Brazil — and Diego Maradona, the late Argentina great with whom Messi was so often compared.\n\nMessi has achieved what Maradona did in 1986, dominate a World Cup for Argentina.\n\nMessi put Argentina ahead from the penalty spot and played a part in Angel Di Maria’s goal that made it 2-0 after 36 minutes.\n\nMbappé scored two goals in a 97-second span to take the game to extra time, and then Messi tapped in his second goal in the 109th minute. But there was still time for another penalty from Mbappé to take the thrilling game to a shootout.\n\nPlease subscribe, like the video and share wherever you can!\n\nHelp support the channel from only £0.99p a month!!\nGet special loyalty badges next to your name in the comments and live chat!

{"description":"Today, I'm getting back surgery to remove a large tumor near my tailbone. It'll be a difficult procedure as the tumor is inside the spinal column and is surrounded by many nerves. Surgeons will have to make it through multiple bones to get in there and remove as much of it as possible. We then have to wait for biopsy results to figure out how to handle all the remaining tumors (I have a total of eight in my spine). It is looking most like I'll be needing radiation therapy as well as chemotherapy. \n\nThey believe what I have is something called Myxopapillary Ependymoma (MEPN). From what I'm researching online, it seems about one in a million people get this. It seems to be growing from the central nervous system out of the spinal cord rather than the brain, in my case. \n\nOver the last 18 months or longer, I've been experiencing an incredible amount of pain in my tailbone, hamstrings, calve muscles, lower back, and gluteus muscles. It is particularly painful when trying to do physical activity such as jumping, running, jogging, and even walking. It feels like a knife is being stabbed up into my tailbone area. So, it's been pretty painful filming my YouTube videos for a while now. This is why I haven't been doing as many martial arts and other fun and crazy physical challenges lately. Hopefully, after this surgery I'll be able to get back to normal life and doing all the fun things I used to do.\n\nThanks to all of you who have been super supportive and positive throughout this. I really appreciate it. Also, thank you to everybody at Keck Medicine at USC in Los Angeles, CA. Every single person I spent time with, surgeons, nurses, physical therapists, doctors, MRI technicians, etc... everybody was super positive and just had a really good attitude despite having a very difficult job. \n\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.

After finishing in second place at last year’s championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods will return for a third consecutive year, hoping to earn their first win. 2021 winners John Daly and his son, University of Arkansas sophomore John Daly II, will be back in action after securing a two-shot win last time out and will be looking to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. Four-time winners Bernhard Langer and his son, Jason, return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, for the first time since 2020, while Justin Thomas and his dad, Mike, will be eager to continue their good run of form at the event which saw them claim victory in 2020 and a third-place finish in 2021. LPGA Tour star and Olympic gold medallist Nelly Korda will once again be partnering with her father, Petr, a former professional tennis player who claimed a Grand Slam victory at the 1998 Australian Open.  \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Tiger and Charlie Woods shoot 13-under 59 | Round 1 | PNC Championship | 2022","duration":394,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20221218","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIKatrlcA0g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/bIKatrlcA0g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":746911}}

Be wary when traveling on foot, or switching the track's direction; Charles might be waiting for you.\nUpgrade your train to fit your needs.\n\nGo looting or complete missions to find \"Scraps\", which can be used to turn your train into a death machine on wheels.\nGet help from the townspeople.\n\nHelp out the settlers in return for high powered weapons, and other items vital to Charles' destruction.\nFight Charles to the death.\n\nComplete the main questline, and summon Charles to a mortal duel. If you’ve gained enough strength, firepower, and skill, Charles may finally meet his match.\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain.

{"description":"Amy and Sonic, Sonic and Amy, Sonamy: Amy Rose doesn’t care what you call them, as long as you recognise that the Blue Blur and her are destined to be together. Although, somebody should probably tell Sonic the Hedgehog, because he doesn’t seem interested in giving Ms Rose a new surname (which I guess would make her Amy the Hedgehog… or Mrs. Sonic Hedgehog?... ANYWAY…). Looking to make her dream a reality, Amy turns to Tails for help. That was her first mistake. It was supposed to be Sonic and Amy Rose, not Sonic vs Amy Rose. That’s what everybody wanted… except for Miles Prower, of course. \n\nWhy rewatch the Sonic movie, when you’ve got a perfectly good Amy Rose movie right here. And Sonic Frontiers and Sonic Prime can wait while you relive the entirety of There’s Something About Amy (with a BRAND NEW epilogue that shows you what Tails and Amy are up to now).

{"description":"At the 2022 PNC Championship pro-am, Tiger Woods took a video of his son’s golf swing so he could give Charlie instant feedback as they analyze the swing together. Check out this cool father-son moment as Tiger Woods and Charlie Woods prepare to play in the two-day event.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n \r\nThe 2022 PNC Championship will once again see 20 major champions tee it up alongside their family members during the two-day, 36-hole scramble event. After finishing in second place at last year’s championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods will return for a third consecutive year, hoping to earn their first win. 2021 winners John Daly and his son, University of Arkansas sophomore John Daly II, will be back in action after securing a two-shot win last time out and will be looking to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. Four-time winners Bernhard Langer and his son, Jason, return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, for the first time since 2020, while Justin Thomas and his dad, Mike, will be eager to continue their good run of form at the event which saw them claim victory in 2020 and a third-place finish in 2021. LPGA Tour star and Olympic gold medallist Nelly Korda will once again be partnering with her father, Petr, a former professional tennis player who claimed a Grand Slam victory at the 1998 Australian Open. \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Tiger Woods gives son Charlie INSTANT feedback on his swing","duration":141,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20221216","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lfEJyxDwYk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6lfEJyxDwYk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":626694}}
