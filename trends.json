{"description":"Dwayne Johnson revealed in message from Hawaii that a live-action reimagining of Disney Animation‚Äôs 2016 hit feature film ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù is in development.\n \nThe new feature film is produced by Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia via their Seven Bucks Productions, and Beau Flynn via Flynn Picture Co. Executive producers include Auli‚Äòi Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the 2016 film, and Scott Sheldon of Flynn Picture Co. Jared Bush and Samoan industry pro Dana Ledoux Miller will also take part in the production. Bush, who was a director and co-writer of Disney‚Äôs Oscar¬Æ-winning feature ‚ÄúEncanto‚Äù and a writer and co-director on Disney‚Äôs Oscar¬Æ-winning film ‚ÄúZootopia,‚Äù wrote the screenplay for 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoana.‚Äù\n \nLike its animated predecessor, the film will celebrate the islands, communities and traditions of Pacific Islanders as seen through the eyes of a young woman eager to pave her own path. Moana‚Äôs journey of self-discovery and reflection on the lives of her ancestors won hearts worldwide, as did her newfound friendship with an exiled demigod named Maui. \n \nJohnson, who plans to return to the fictional world to set sail with Moana, said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply humbled and overcome with gratitude to bring the beautiful story of Moana to the live action big screen. This story is my culture, and this story is emblematic of our people‚Äôs grace and warrior strength. I wear this culture proudly on my skin and in my soul, and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reunite with Maui, inspired by the mana and spirit of my late grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia, is one that runs very deep for me. I want to thank my partners at Disney for their strong commitment to this special endeavor, because there is no better world for us to honor the story of our people, our passion and our purpose than through the realm of music and dance, which is at the core of who we are as Polynesian people.‚Äù\n \nNative Hawaiian actor Cravalho, who helped shape Moana in the original film, said the beloved protagonist‚Äôs reach is sweeping. ‚ÄúShe has had such a profound impact on how we think of Disney princesses,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMoana‚Äôs strength and perseverance are inspiring‚Äîto audiences around the world, to me and to everyone who helped bring her to life. I‚Äôm looking forward to sharing her story in a whole new way.‚Äù\n \nSean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production (Disney Live Action), said the film would join a successful lineup of live-action adaptations that include 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast,‚Äù 2019‚Äôs ‚ÄúAladdin‚Äù and the highly anticipated live-action version of ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù opening May 26. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still early, but the idea of working with these fantastic partners to tell such a meaningful story on a live-action canvas, particularly as we celebrate 100 years of storytelling at Disney, is thrilling,‚Äùsaid Bailey.\n \nWalt Disney Animation Studios‚Äô ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù debuted in theaters on Nov. 23, 2016, grossing nearly $644 million in global box office. The title, which debuted on Disney+ with the streamer‚Äôs 2019 launch, is among the top 15 movies streamed in the United States in 2022. The film‚Äôs soundtrack, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Opetaia Foa‚Äôiand Mark Mancina, was lauded worldwide. Miranda won a GRAMMY¬Æ for best song written for visual media (‚ÄúHow Far I‚Äôll Go‚Äù), and an Oscar¬Æ nomination for best achievement in music written for motion pictures ‚Äì original song (‚ÄúHow Far I‚Äôll Go‚Äù). In 2021, the ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù soundtrack broke a Billboard Soundtrack chart record for the amount of time spent at number one (52 weeks). Additionally, the film was nominated for an Academy Award (best animated feature film of the year), a BAFTA (best animated feature film) and a pair of Golden Globes¬Æ (best motion picture ‚Äì animated and best original song (‚ÄúHow Far I‚Äôll Go‚Äù).","title":"Live-Action Moana Announcement","duration":128,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20230403","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHXB-5woeHw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHXB-5woeHw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":584703}}

{"description":"This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World... this has never been done before.\n\nThis was one of the most incredible projects I have ever worked on.\n\nTwitter: @Dream\nInstagram: @DreamWasTaken\nSnapchat: @Dream\n\nIn this video, we coded a Minecraft mod that live translates languages through a voice chat above your character in Minecraft. It has fairly good accuracy and can translate most languages around the world. This mod allows you to play Minecraft, make jokes, and have fun with people that can't even speak your language.  \n\nLive voice translation has been being worked on by Google and other companies, and they provide API's for it.  Google glass , apple glasses, and other similar products have been talked about for years with mentions of live-translating interactions in real life. We thought about taking that, and applying it to gaming.\n\nI truly believe that this is the near future for all online games with voice chat, with being able to play and communicate with anyone from anywhere, breaking down the language barrier. I also believe that this is a cool glimpse into the future in real life. If a bunch of kids can do it at home in one of the biggest games in the world, a bunch of engineers and geniuses can make it happen in real life.\n\nIn this video there were plenty of languages, and I was able to laugh and joke with all of them. When testing this mod, I played with friends of mine that spoke different languages, and we were having so much fun playing together and laughing about how crazy it was that we could communicate with each other.\n\nThis has been being worked on for a while and I'm so happy to finally share it with everyone. There are some bugs still, and in this version a couple of the notable bugs were: Minecraft words being incorrectly translated, names being incorrectly translated, and your last word not showing up sometimes.\n\nWhenever this mod's bugs are fixed and it's features are added, I plan on releasing this to the public for free, and with open source so anyone can make any additions they want with ease. Depending on what API is used for transcribing/translations and how many people are being translated, it can be costly, so although the mod will be free from me, using it might require setup on your end.\n\nI am releasing an SMP, the \"United SMP\", which is going to feature creators from all around the world. Equal representation from the languages that are on it, with a mock EU-style committee to make decisions so there is not one owner. This will be launching hopefully later this month, and has 60 creators to start with, 10 of which will be English speaking, 50 of which will be from 5 other languages. Most of these people are people I never would have been able to collaborate with, or make jokes with, or share with my fans, so I am so excited to share our community with the world. There will be more details on my twitter about this, and I will be live streaming the server in the future.\n\nthank you guys for watching and supporting the channel to make stuff like this possible.","title":"This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World...","duration":1518,"channel_id":"UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w","author":"Dream","date":"20230403","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BZIxt07UNU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BZIxt07UNU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":3372734}}
