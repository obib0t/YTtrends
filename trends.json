{"description":"Starship gave us quite a show during today’s first flight test of a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy rocket from Starbase in Texas. \n \nAt 8:33 a.m. CT, Starship successfully lifted off from the orbital launch pad for the first time. The vehicle cleared the pad and beach as Starship climbed to an apogee of ~39 km over the Gulf of Mexico – the highest of any Starship to-date. The vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble. The flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship. As is standard procedure, the pad and surrounding area was cleared well in advance of the test, and we expect the road and beach near the pad to remain closed until tomorrow.\n\nWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship.\n \nThank you to our customers, Cameron County, and the wider community for the continued support and encouragement. And congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting first flight test of Starship!","title":"Starship Flight Test","duration":3200,"channel_id":"UCtI0Hodo5o5dUb67FeUjDeA","author":"SpaceX","date":"20230420","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1wcilQ58hI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-1wcilQ58hI/hqdefault.jpg?v=643dc70a","content":{"View count":11355055}}

We do things differently here so please read these rules carefully. These show not only how to behave on stream, but should serve as a guideline for if you wish to call yourself kindred.\n\nSTREAM ETIQUETTE\nA. Please keep chat relevant to the stream and do not spam, troll or discuss controversial or offensive topics.\nB. Do not mention another streamer unless I bring them up first, nor should you mention me in any other chat unless I am mentioned first.\nC. All languages are welcome here, and you will be timed out if you ask people to stop talking in a certain language.\nD. Absolutely no spoilers or backseating unless directly asked for.\nE. Do not trauma dump in any way. If you use a supa to do so it will be deleted and I will ignore it. If you are struggling, please seek professional help or call someone, help is available, and you aren't alone; https://www.helpguide.org/find-aelp.htm\nF. Use emotes in chat as often as you like, but keep a limit of three per message.\nG. If you’d like to send supas, please use either your own currency, or, if you can’t, use one that is of similar value. Supas that misuse of another country's currency will be ignored, unless they are from Kindred who come from that country.\n\nRESPECT\nWhen engaging in other parts of the internet, respect those spaces and, if presenting as a kindred, do so with the politeness and kindness you would show other kindred. No matter how much you love being a kindred or love me, never use your passion for this community as an excuse to flame or attack others. If you do so, I do not want your support. You’re also welcome to ship me with anyone you like (with their permission of course) but please remember that your ship is only a fantasy and not to let it influence your world-view.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\nYou are welcome (even encouraged) to treat these streams as a source of warmth, happiness and community. If you associate these feelings with me and develop an attachment, that’s okay too. However, if you become too attached to the degree that it becomes unhealthy or parasocial, I trust you to seek help and to find happiness elsewhere. If you can do this, it will not offend me and I will be proud of you. You’re welcome back anytime as long as your engagement is done so with regards to your health.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\nLearn the difference between criticism and hate. Ignore hate, and if it’s in our chat, we’ll remove it. Honest criticism however is welcome and I trust all kindred to listen to criticism and assess it fairly. There is NEVER an excuse to bicker, fight or become defensive when someone wants to help. However, if you’d like to give criticism, please save it for YouTube comments after stream.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n⏰【Luxiem】\n\n【Vox Akuma ヴォックス・アクマ】\nhttps://twitter.com/Vox_Akuma\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/Vox_Akuma\n\n【Mysta Rias】\nhttps://twitter.com/Mysta_Rias\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIM92Ok_spNKLVB5TsgwseQ\n\n【Ike Eveland】\nhttps://twitter.com/ike_eveland\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yNIKGvy-YUrwYupVdLDXA\n\n【Shu Yamino】\nhttps://twitter.com/shu_yamino\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG0rzBZV_QMP4MtWg6IjhEA\n\n【Luca Kaneshiro】\nhttps://twitter.com/luca_kaneshiro\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Gb7Uawe20QyFibhLl1lzA\n\n■ For more information, visit:\n ・ NIJISANJI Official YouTube (EN): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-JS... ・ NIJISANJI Official Twitch:\n https://www.twitch.tv/nijisanji_en\n ・ NIJISANJI Official Twitter (English account): https://twitter.com/NIJISANJI_World\n ・ANYCOLOR Official Website: https://www.anycolor.co.jp/\n ・ NIJISANJI Official Reddit:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijisanji/\n ・ NIJISANJI Official Instagram:\n https://instagram.com/nijisanji_en\n ・ NIJISANJI Official Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@nijisanji_en?...\n ・ NIJISANJI Official Facebook (English account): https://www.facebook.com/nijisanji.of...\n ・ NIJISANJI Official YouTube (JP): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7Y...\n\n▽　Guidance for minors\nhttps://www.anycolor.co.jp/notice-for-minors-en\n\n▽　For Business and PR Inquiries \nhttps://www.anycolor.co.jp/en/contact","title":"【NEW OUTFIT REVEAL】It's so cold here... #LuxiemOutfitRelay","duration":1813,"channel_id":"UCckdfYDGrjojJM28n5SHYrA","author":"Vox Akuma【NIJISANJI EN】","date":"20230421","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eXovWIuSV8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9eXovWIuSV8/hqdefault.jpg?v=644225e3","content":{"View count":383371}}

{"description":"Two late goals from Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka managed to salvage a point against Southampton, but could only ensure we claimed a third draw in succession.\n\nWe got off to the worst possible start when Carlos Alcaraz netted within the first 30 seconds, and then on 14 minutes Theo Walcott came back to haunt his former club to hand us a mountain to climb.\n\nGabriel Martinelli’s 15th goal of the season reduced the arrears before half-time, however Duje Caleta-Car restored the two-goal cushion on 65 minutes and as we entered the final five minutes it looked like a loss was on the cards.\n\nHowever the skipper fired in from range before Saka pounced to prod home a loose ball in the final minute of normal time to grab a share of the spoils in unlikely circumstances.\n\nThings started to go wrong just 27 seconds into the game when Aaron Ramsdale attempted to pass out from the back but didn’t spot Alcaraz, who snuck in to intercept, control and fire the ball into the bottom corner to stun the home crowd.\n\nTheir shock quickly turned to encouragement as they tried to rally the players and some direct running by the electric Martinelli led to chances for Odegaard and Oleksandr Zinchenko who failed to hit the target, but the visitors piled further early misery on us by moving 2-0 ahead.\n\nAlcaraz was again involved, picking the ball up in the middle and feeding it into the path of Walcott, who did what he did so often in our colours by tucking the chance away first-time into the bottom corner and put us deep in trouble.\n\nWe needed a quick response, and it arrived six minutes later as Martinelli gave us a lifeline. Saka tricked his way past Romain Perraud and did well not only to keep the ball in play, but find our top scorer who produced some great movement to get free and flash home a volley that reignited our chances.\n\nWe couldn’t afford any further mishaps and only a double save by Ramsdale to deny Mohammed Elyanoussi and Alcaraz kept the deficit at one, but as a frantic opening quarter began to settle, we kept probing in and around the visitors’ area and Gabriel would head over on the stroke of half-time.\n\nThen in stoppage-time Ben White flicked a Saka corner goalwards which was brilliantly cleared off the line by the back-peddling Alcaraz, and then Gabriel Jesus saw an attempt blocked in the box as we went into the break down, but not out.\n\nAt half-time Ruben Selles tightened things up by moving to a five-man defence, and that saw our opportunities dry up. With it being hard enough to score once to grab a draw, a hammer blow to our title chances arrived midway through the second half when the Saints added their third.\n\nOn a rare foray forward in the second half, James Ward-Prowse swung over a corner which was flicked on by Armel Bella-Kotchap, and Calta-Car headed the ball past Ramsdale to dampen the mood.\n\nA golden chance fell to Jesus straight away when he was picked out in space at the far post by compatriot Martinelli but he couldn’t keep his attempt down, and as was the story after the break we couldn’t find a way through a stubborn Southampton defence, despite plenty of pressure.\n\nWith three minutes to play, we managed to claw our way back into contention when Odegaard played a one-two with White and bent the ball home from the edge of the box to make it 3-2, and incredibly two minutes later we got ourselves level.\n\nReiss Nelson picked up the ball in a dangerous position on the left and fired towards the bottom corner. Gavin Bazunu did well to get down low and keep it out, but Saka tucked home the rebound to get the Emirates rocking.\n\nEight minutes of stoppage time provided even more noise, and we were fractions away from completing an incredible comeback when Leandro Trossard let fly from range and struck the crossbar, meaning there wasn’t quite to be a Bournemouth-esque ending this time as we were forced to settle for a point.\n\n#arsenal \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka, Vivianne Miedema, Leah Williamson,Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Beth Mead, Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White, and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: http://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: http://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: http://arsn.al/tiktok","title":"HIGHLIGHTS | Arsenal vs Southampton (3-3) | Martinelli, Odegaard, Saka","duration":120,"channel_id":"UCpryVRk_VDudG8SHXgWcG0w","author":"Arsenal","date":"20230421","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcJ79Yq6hvM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PcJ79Yq6hvM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2259526}}

Finally, the multiple decades have seemingly allowed the Nintendo Corporation to cool off and give Mario and Luigi another shot at cashing in in Hollywood.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie definitely raises some questions. Like why was there a warp pipe under the streets of Brooklyn? Why did Princess Peach bring up her mysterious past and then not explain any further? What are these power-up boxes and how did they get there? Why didn’t Toad have to do that obstacle course, and why did Mario have to spend so much time doing it only to fail?\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Super Mario Bros.

{"description":"Not all races can be won. #FASTX \nGet tickets now: https://tickets.fastxmovie.com/\n\nThe end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga\n\nOfficial Motion Picture Soundtrack Pre-Save: https://fastx.lnk.to/soundtrack!Trailer\nGasolina Remix: https://fastx.lnk.to/GasolinaRemix!FastX","title":"FAST X | Official Trailer 2","duration":156,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230419","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOb15GVFZxU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOb15GVFZxU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":9341339}}

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.

Five of the derailed cars were carrying vinyl chloride, a hazardous material that built up pressure in the resulting fires, eventually leading Norfolk Southern to vent and burn it in a bid to prevent an explosion. The ensuing fireball and cloud brought the normally unseen process of hazardous cargo transportation into a single chilling view, and the event became a lightning rod of controversy over rail industry regulations, federal involvement in chemical spills, and much more.\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"At the Department of Collective Behaviour, part of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, researchers are putting locusts into simulated worlds, both virtual and physical, in the hope that they can figure out how devastating swarms form and move. ■ About the Centre: https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/ https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin\n\nEdited by Michelle Martin https://twitter.com/mrsmmartin\nThanks to David Walter for the suggestion\n\nThis is the most uncomfortable I've ever felt while filming, for a few reasons. First, of course, because of the locust swarm itself. Second, because animal research — even on creatures as simple and pestilent as locusts — always raises ethical questions. Now, the researchers are careful with the locusts, and I don't think many people could have a problem with this. Indeed, most of the world currently has zero ethical restrictions on insect experimentation — but it's still worth interrogating whether this is okay. And finally: because if we can do this so easily to less intelligent creatures... what's to stop something more intelligent coming along and doing the same to us?\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo","title":"It's the Matrix, but for locusts.","duration":424,"channel_id":"UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A","author":"Tom Scott","date":"20230417","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRIBVykhpC4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KRIBVykhpC4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGFkgWShZMA8=&rs=AOn4CLDT-NqBWWIt6LbWxzDA41VNd7teWg","content":{"View count":1918821}}

But then it's up to you to achieve success and take over New York City any way you like.\n\nSlowly build multiple small businesses, grow them into huge corporations, or carve your own unique path – the possibilities are limitless in this vast business sandbox. You've never played anything like this!\n\nGo from a small apartment and public transport to luxury suites, fast cars and designer furniture. Put your money into investment funds and real estate. Succeed, fail, rebuild. But remember to take care of yourself, sleep and stay happy on your rise to the top.\n\nDo you have what it takes to build your own empire?\n\n\nGo from nothing to the most prominent tycoon in New York. Start a business, work smart, make it thrive and enjoy your life. How do you want to be successful? How far can you push it? How long can you make it last?\n\nStart your own gift shop, supermarket, coffee shop, law firm, clothing store, liquor store, florist, and more. You decide what success is - whether it’s a single shop, a chain of fast-food restaurants, a huge corporation, or making millions developing websites.\n\nTake out a loan, rent a building, design the logo, renovate the store, get stock, manage your money, hire staff, and build your infrastructure. Soon, you may have to start importing products from the harbour and distributing them through a network of warehouses.\n\nA bigger business means managers. Hire HR Managers, Logistics Managers, and Purchasing Agents. They all need desks and computers, so you’ll need a fancy headquarters.\n\nNeed a delivery truck? Travel to a dealer and buy one. Need food? Go to a supermarket, but make sure you have a refrigerator at home. Big Ambitions is a life sim where your character has to physically interact with the world to survive and succeed.\n\nEnter any building in New York and buy it. Go from a small apartment to a dream penthouse in midtown, a luxurious townhouse in Hell’s Kitchen, or a series of skyscrapers. Fill each with furniture that suits your style and standing. Invest your hard-earned cash in real estate to grow your empire. Take over the city piece by piece.\n\nSpend your wealth however you wish. Buy a big SUV, a speedy sports car, or the new luxurious Mersaidi S500. Maybe risk it all at the casinos or put your money into investment funds and reap the rewards.\n\nAs you progress, you always need to ensure you get enough sleep and stay healthy and happy. Enjoy the journey, for as you grow older, you’ll discover that money can’t buy you time... or can it?\n\nBig Ambitions takes what you love about the viral sensation ‘Startup Company’ to even greater heights.","title":"I Became a Multimillionaire and Turned an Entire City Into a Total Wasteland - Big Ambitions","duration":1827,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20230416","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77zyN0WUuE0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/77zyN0WUuE0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2598751}}

{"description":"Hello and welcome to another video!\n\nToday we’re going to be recreating a recipe that we saw going viral on tiktok last year: the mac & cheese milkshake! We thought that cheese foam on bubble tea was good when we tried it on this channel, and cheesecake is good too (hey - cheese is good in general, right?), so this recipe might not be all that bad, even if it was originally intended to be an April fool’s joke.\n\nSo bring on the dairy - we’re making a Mac & Cheese Milkshake! Let us know how you think we did, and if you might want to try this lactose heavy delicacy. \n\nAlso PS - we had a slight complication with our camera on set, so the wide shot is a little soft focused. We tried to fix it in post, but it is still a little noticeable.
