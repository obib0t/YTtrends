{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by Amanda Seyfried for a tour of her peaceful home in New York City. _The Crowded Room_ and _Mamma Mia!_ star spends most of her time upstate at her Catskills farmhouse, but when work calls her away she needed a tranquil city base fit for her family–with the help of Sarah Zames and Colin Stief from General Assembly they aimed to bring some of those farmhouse vibes to Manhattan. Stunning original arched windows create a bright, airy space enhanced by light oak features, and Amanda’s love of antique silhouettes paired with modern pieces offers an eclectic yet zen feel, perfect for relaxing after a busy day in the city–“I’m part of the development of a Broadway show,” Amanda says “This is going to be my home for six, seven, eight months. I know this will be where I live, and I’m comfortable here. I feel really safe.”\r\n\r\nAmanda Seyfried currently stars in The Crowded Room on Apple TV+, with new episodes debuting on Fridays through July 28, 2023.\r\n\r\nSee more of Amanda's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/inside-amanda-seyfrieds-farmhouse-inspired-new-york-city-pied-a-terre\r\n\r\nShop Amanda’s home style!\r\n\r\nFurniture: \r\n(Similar) Burrow Nomad Velvet Sofa with Chaise: https://fave.co/3NN9AFr\r\n(Similar) Joss & Main Freer Dining Table: https://fave.co/3NLC5DI\r\n(Similar) Etsy Round Wood Coffee Table: https://fave.co/43Q8D4Z\r\n\r\nLighting:\r\nLumens Crystorama Xavier Wall Sconce: https://fave.co/3JuJioU\r\nLumens Voliere Pendant by Mathieu Challières: https://fave.co/44l8Ddg\r\n(Similar) Crate & Barrel Andre 2-Light Pendant: https://fave.co/3Nq2JR2\r\n(Similar) Etsy Natural Rope Pendant: https://fave.co/3Nusi3D\r\n1stdibs Cumberland Sconce: https://fave.co/4309cIh\r\n(Similar) West Elm Sculptural Geo Sconce: https://fave.co/44dAwDG\r\n(Similar) Crate & Barrel Cane White Ceramic Lamp: https://fave.co/440q6aS\r\n\r\nRugs/Wallpaper: \r\n(Similar) Etsy Authentic Checkered Moroccan Rug: https://fave.co/44l95YG\r\nEtsy ÉLITIS Embroidered Fabric, Galactica: https://fave.co/3NlGNGK\r\n\r\nAccessories: \r\nFarrow & Ball Wimborne White Paint: https://fave.co/441VAxA\r\n(Similar) Pottery Barn Artisan Handcrafted Footed Bowl: https://fave.co/3NLwFZm\r\n(Similar) Banana Republic Fine Linen Duvet Cover: https://fave.co/3pnhrQR\r\n(Similar) Our Place Perfect Pot: https://fave.co/42XuUN6\r\n(Similar) Etsy Draped Cloth Vase: https://fave.co/3r86bbp\r\n(Similar) Liberty London Astier De Villatte Sobre Pitcher: https://fave.co/3Nv1Uq6\r\n(Similar) Etsy Mother Daughter Illustration: https://fave.co/46qPxnR\r\n(Similar) Coral & Tusk Sparklers Pillow: https://fave.co/46o8JCn\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nDesign by Sarah Zames and Colin Stief of General Assembly\r\n\r\nArtwork: Cyrielle Gulacsy, White Light 01, 2020, acrylic paint on paper, 93 x 137cm.\r\n\r\nDirector: Jasia Kaulbach\r\nDirector of Photography: Eric Brouse\r\nEditor: William Long\r\nGuest: Amanda Seyfried\r\nSenior Producer: Vara Reese\r\nLine Producer: Joseph Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Brandon Fuhr\r\nProduction Manager: Melissa Heber\r\nProduction Coordinator: Fernando Davila\r\nCamera Operator: Cloud Corredor\r\nAudio: Gabe Quiroga\r\nProduction Assistant: Francis McNeil\r\nStylist (Interior Stylist/Fashion Stylist): Sarah Zames; Colin King; Elizabeth Stewart; Eliza Yerry\r\nHair & Make-Up: Renato Campora; Genevieve Herr\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nAssistant Editor: Andy Morell\r\nColorist: Oliver Eid\n\nWant even more AD?

{"description":"YENA (최예나) - Hate Rodrigo (Feat. 우기 ((여자)아이들)) MV\n\nYENA(최예나) 2ND SINGLE ALBUM 〈HATE XX〉\n\n춤, 노래, 예능 다방면에서 전천후 활약 중인 ‘젠지 대표’ YENA(최예나)가 약 5개월 만에 두 번째 싱글 앨범 [HATE XX]로 돌아온다. 전작 [Love War]을 통해 짙은 감수성과 더욱 깊어진 음악적 스펙트럼을 선보였던 YENA(최예나)는 이번 앨범에서 다양한 감정 표현에 도전하며 장르를 넘나드는 아티스트의 면모를 선보인다.\n\nYENA(최예나)의 두 번째 싱글 앨범 [HATE XX]의 타이틀곡 ‘Hate Rodrigo (Feat. 우기 (여자)아이들))’는 선망의 대상에 대한 좋아하는 마음을 애써 부정해보지만 결국 인정할 수밖에 없는 귀여운 질투를 담은 곡이다. 누구나 느꼈던, 하지만 쉽게 드러내지 못하고 삼켰던 ‘질투’와 ‘동경’의 감정을 YENA(최예나)만의 방식으로 솔직하고 당당하게 표현했다. 전 세대의 공감대를 형성하는 스토리와 모두의 향수를 자극할 Y2K 스타일링은 ‘젠지 대표’ YENA(최예나)의 매력을 한층 끌어올린다.\n\n‘선’과 ‘악’을 깨닫게 된 소녀의 변신을 노래하는 수록곡 ‘WICKED’는 YENA(최예나)의 성숙한 보이스가 돋보이는 곡으로, ‘선악과’를 모티프로 한 YENA(최예나)표 극락 퍼포먼스를 통해 곡에 담긴 감정과 스토리를 더욱 효과적으로 전달한다. 올라운더 YENA(최예나)의 진면목을 보여줄 ‘WICKED’의 퍼포먼스는 K-POP 레전드 안무가 최영준이 맡아 눈길을 끈다.\n\n여기에, 바람난 연인을 향한 ‘그라데이션 분노’와 섬찟한 감정을 드러낸 ‘BAD HOBBY’는 한 편의 복수극을 연상케 하는 몰입도 높은 가사와 한층 진일보 된 YENA(최예나)의 음악적 스펙트럼을 담은 곡이다.\n\n‘젠지 대표’ YENA(최예나)가 느끼는 솔직하고 다이내믹한 감정 변화를 YENA(최예나) 특유의 밝은 에너지로 표현해낸 두 번째 싱글 앨범 [HATE XX]. 과연 이번 앨범에서도 또 하나의 “예나 장르”를 탄생시킬지 귀추가 주목된다.\n\n\n#YENA  #최예나 #Hate_Rodrigo #우기","title":"YENA (최예나) - Hate Rodrigo (Feat. 우기 ((여자)아이들)) MV","duration":228,"channel_id":"UC_pwIXKXNm5KGhdEVzmY60A","author":"Stone Music Entertainment","date":"20230627","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4ovX4LQlKg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h4ovX4LQlKg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4071541}}

People are made of cells, cells are made of molecules, molecules are made of atoms, atoms are made of electrons, protons, and neutrons. And protons are each made of three up or down quarks. Simple stuff, right? All except for that last part. Protons are actually made of many, many quarks that happen to look like three only when we look at them in a particular way. And even then, sometimes they’re made of 5 quarks - including the charm quark.\n\nCheck Our Matt on Star Talk with Neil deGrasse Tyson\n https://youtu.be/OcX7xpxOC2U \n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\nSearch the Entire Space Time Library Here: https://search.pbsspacetime.com/\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Fernando Franco Félix & Matt O'Dowd \nPost Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini, Adriano Leal & Stephanie Faria\nDirected by Andrew Kornhaber\nAssociate Producer: Bahar Gholipour\nExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew Kornhaber\nExecutive in Charge for PBS: Maribel Lopez\nDirector of Programming for PBS: Gabrielle Ewing\nAssistant Director of Programming for PBS: John Campbell\n\nSpacetime is produced by Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.\nThis program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.\n© 2023 PBS.

Hitting champions with abilities or killing enemies reduces this ability’s cooldown.\n \n\nQ - Darkin Daggers \nNaafiri hurls Darkin-tainted blades, dealing physical damage and inflicting a bleed for a few seconds.This ability may be recast. If enemies hit are already bleeding, instead deal the remaining bleed damage plus bonus physical damage and missing health physical damage. If the target was a champion, Naafiri restores some health. Packmates will leap at the first target hit, prioritizing champions and attacking them for a few seconds.\n \n\nW - Hounds’ Pursuit  \nAfter a brief delay, Naafiri dashes at an enemy, dealing physical damage and briefly slowing her target or the first champion she collides with. This ability gains range based on ultimate rank. Packmates become untargetable and dash alongside Naafiri, dealing additional damage per Packmate.\n \n\nE - Eviscerate  \nNaafiri surges forward, dashing and dealing physical damage to enemies she passes through, then explodes outward, dealing additional physical damage. Packmates are recalled to Naafiri and are healed to full.\n \n\nR - The Call of the Pack  \nNaafiri prepares to hunt, empowering her Packmates and spawning bonus Packmates for a short duration. Naafiri then gains a burst of out of combat Movespeed, vision, and the first time she hits an enemy champion, she gains a shield.
