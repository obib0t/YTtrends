{"description":"I created my dream tank, a 1000 gallon cloud rainforest vivarium, and constructing it has been quite a journey. It is fully stocked with tropical plants, automated climate control, and even some creatures that managed to sneak in through the terrarium decor. However, the goal of the vivarium experiment was to recreate and study a rainforest ecosystem so to complete the project, I needed to add more animals. Little did I know, doing so would amp up the biological action within the vivarium in a way that I could never have predicted. Hope you enjoy Part 6 of my ecosystem vivarium series. Ant love forever!

{"description":"In Loving Memory of Tom Smothers.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers\n\nThe Smothers Brothers, Tom and Dick, are one of the most iconic comedy duos in the history of television. Tom and Dick began performing as a duo in the late 1950s, playing in coffeehouses and clubs in San Francisco. Their act consisted of music, comedy, and witty banter, which quickly gained them a following.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers became a household name in the late 1960s with their variety show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The show was groundbreaking in its approach to comedy, pushing the boundaries with political satire and social commentary. The show also featured up-and-coming musical acts, including The Doors and The Who, and introduced the world to comedians like Steve Martin and George Carlin.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers' irreverent style has made them a beloved and enduring force in American comedy. \n\nFor clip licensing information, contact Retro Media: http://www.retrovideo.com/ \n\nClown Jewels: \nOfficial Website: https://clownjewels.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@clownjewels\nFacebook: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/InstagramID\nTwitter: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n800 Pound Gorilla: \nOfficial Website: https://800poundgorillamedia.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@800pgm\nFacebook: https://800PGR.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://800PGR.lnk.to/InstagramID\nTwitter: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n#smothersbrothers","title":"In Loving Memory | Tom Smothers | 1937 - 2023 | If I Had A Ship","duration":366,"channel_id":"UCA2QfK-lVdi2j3LCns0j7LQ","author":"The Smothers Brothers","date":"20231227","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqHqm6wuGTo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wqHqm6wuGTo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":956142}}

If you download it for free with my link, you also get a huge bonus pack including vehicles, boosters, and more: https://playwt.link/soundsmith\n\nWar Thunder is a highly detailed vehicle combat game containing over 2000 playable tanks, aircraft, and ships spanning over 100 years of development. Immerse yourself completely in dynamic battles with an unparalleled combination of realism and approachability.\n\nSURPRISE (again)! A Mann‚Äôs Guide to the Huntsman is real. It wasn‚Äôt a bait-and-switch, this is a double feature.\n\nSome people think that gaming guides should teach the viewer how to use an item or a character in the most optimal, effective way possible. Some people think that guides have to be a serious, well-informed take on a technique or style of play. Some people are stupid. Why bother being optimal with a weapon when you can be a true Mann Co. Mercenary and run around using it like a bumbling idiot? It's way more fun if you do that.\n\nCo-Created by Clockwerk Smurf: https://www.youtube.com/user/marinefighter9 \n\nAnimation/Thumbnails by:\nToten: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUXaD2C5sgwXgio0C71qtTg \nKrunkidile: https://linktr.ee/krunkidile\nProGamingNerd: https://www.youtube.com/@ProGamingNerdTV\nSteaky: https://www.youtube.com/@Steaky\n\nAnimation Concepts/Boards by:\nMaxiqueSt: https://www.youtube.com/c/MaxiqueSt \n\nCustom Models/Maps by:\nAlaxe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZq-u6jhQrviQ905HMRvGVQ \nZir Zeek: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6y_AqeNf9OkfuLk71kc-DQ \n\nGraphics and Paintovers by:\nMonsieur Saboteur: https://www.youtube.com/@monsieursaboteur7282\nSerialArtistry: https://www.youtube.com/@serialartistry\n\nAdditional Voice Cast:\nClockwerk Smurf: https://www.youtube.com/user/marinefighter9\nLazyPurple: https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyPurple \nToten: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUXaD2C5sgwXgio0C71qtTg \n\nAdditional Gameplay Provided by:\nClockwerk Smurf: https://www.youtube.com/user/marinefighter9\nDeroplat: https://www.youtube.com/@deroplat\nJBird: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOaf-4kabBXZR9cAfRO4GrQ\n\nGameplay Skits with:\nDeroplat: https://www.youtube.com/@deroplat\nKrunkidile: https://linktr.ee/krunkidile\nSerialArtistry: https://www.youtube.com/@serialartistry\nMonsieur Saboteur: https://www.youtube.com/@monsieursaboteur7282\nGunk: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC82qnprliM2hRFEkorgpTBw \nGarka23: https://www.youtube.com/c/Garka23 \nNCTWL: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/nctwl\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\nUncle Dane: https://www.youtube.com/@UncleDane\nMaxiqueST: https://www.youtube.com/c/MaxiqueSt \nThe ChristoLee Show: https://www.youtube.com/c/ChristopherLeeProductions \nAce Creators\n\nAnd an extra special thanks to War Thunder for sponsoring this video!\n\nHere‚Äôs a pastebin of all the music tracks used in this video:\nhttps://pastebin.com/g7QVdEzT\n\n#tf2  #soundsmith  #gaming","title":"[TF2] A Mann's Guide to the Huntsman","duration":1167,"channel_id":"UC0Eqb484X8EiNrFLSUQVsaA","author":"SoundSmith","date":"20231223","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fds1ZkbUZc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_fds1ZkbUZc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":928515}}
