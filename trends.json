{"description":"Tipping in the United States is on the rise and experts are calling it tipflation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the number of tips provided at full-service restaurants grew by 17% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Meanwhile the tip frequency at quick-service restaurants rose 16% during the same time period. Experts say that's because of the newer and sleeker-looking Point-of-Sale, or POS, systems by tech companies like Square, Toast and Clover, who also have increased their sales as a result. The pressure to tip well in front of the tip receiver, before a service is completed, or in front of other customers makes a difference for many. After customers swipe their credit card, they're typically prompted with three large tipping options on a screen. While businesses can opt out of the tipping feature, most aren't. In fact, even Starbucks started prompting customers for tips in stores in September 2022. With Americans being pressured to tip higher percentages and for more services, the question is, where is the tipping point?\n\nChapters: \n00:00 — Introduction \n02:25 — Why we tip \n04:09 — Tipping in 2023\n05:45 — Big Tech\n09:14 — Tipping point\n\nProduced by: Emily Lorsch\nEdited by: Jacob Harrell\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nGraphics by: Midnight Snacks\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.

{"description":"More than a year into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, signs continue to mount that Moscow is struggling under the weight of ballooning military spending. Moscow has consistently put on a brave face when it came to the country's economic health. But it's now classified or unlisted a third of the economic data coming out of the country. According to Russian Finance Ministery data unlisted or classified spending has doubled since last year, indicating around a third of the budget is likely connected to the war effort. 31 Billion dollars in total, dwarfing all other publicly listed government expenses. And Moscow's black budget is ballooning at a time of falling commodity prices, which make up the lion's share of Russia's earnings. Western sanctions also continue to bite according to Russia's president. \n\nAt the same time, publicly criticizing Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine can lead to harsh legal consequences. Most people prefer to voice their discontent in private. But one critical conversation between two prominent Russians has surfaced online.\n \nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#Russia #RussiaLeaks #Economy","title":"Ballooning 'black' budget and leaked conversations: Emerging cracks in Putin's Russia | DW News","duration":778,"channel_id":"UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg","author":"DW News","date":"20230330","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcHysuEJ9n8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wcHysuEJ9n8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1592498}}

During the years trapped inside with chronic health problems  the main thing that kept me going was a belief that one day I would come out the other side, and be able to achieve success through music. I don’t have a label, and sometimes pushing these things as hard as I want becomes a massive challenge, and I find myself frustrated that there aren’t enough hours in the day to push it as far as I want to. I would love to ask a favour to anyone who has ever enjoyed my music over the years, and it will only take a few minutes of your day.It would  mean the world to me if you shared these tracks as much as you can, over social media platforms, with friends, over email. Together, and with your help I can hopefully reach people all over the world, and get one step closer to the dream I always had!

{"description":"This Summer, meet the residents of Element City\n\nWatch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s #Elemental and see the movie in 3D, only in theaters June 16!\n\nCheck out a brand-new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental,” an all-new original feature film that transports moviegoers to an extraordinary place called Element City, where a host of elements live and work. The trailer showcases each element—air, earth, water and fire—and what sets them apart according to Ember, a quick-witted and fiery woman who’s always stayed close to home in Firetown. In “Elemental,” which opens in theaters on June 16, she finally ventures out of her comfort zone to explore this spectacular world born from the imaginations of Pixar’s filmmakers and specifically crafted for the big-screen experience. Element City is inspired by big cities around the globe and embraces theorized contributions from each elemental community—from giant pine-tree-like buildings and waterfall skyscrapers to a tornado-shaped arena called Cyclone Stadium. \n\nJoining the previously announced voice cast including Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as Ember and Wade, respectively, are Ronnie del Carmen as Ember’s soon-to-be retired dad, Bernie; Shila Ommi as Ember’s love-seeking mom, Cinder; Wendi McLendon-Covey as Wade’s stormy and Air-Ball-loving boss, Gale; Catherine O’Hara as Wade’s welcoming mom, Brook; Mason Wertheimer as Ember’s admiring earth neighbor, Clod; and Joe Pera as an overgrown city bureaucrat, Fern.\n \nDirected by Peter Sohn, produced by Denise Ream, p.g.a., and executive produced by Pete Docter, “Elemental” features a screenplay by John Hoberg & Kat Likkel and Brenda Hsueh with story by Sohn, Hoberg & Likkel and Hsueh. The film’s original score was composed and conducted by Thomas Newman. \n\r\nPixar Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixar/\r\nPixar Twitter: https://twitter.com/pixar\r\nPixar Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pixar\r\n \r\nCopyright: (C) Disney•Pixar","title":"Elemental | Official Trailer","duration":139,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20230328","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXzcyx9V0xw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hXzcyx9V0xw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":8189783}}

{"description":"Trolls Band Together - In Theaters this Fall\n\nThis holiday season, get ready for an action-packed, all-star, rainbow-colored family reunion like no other as Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake return for the new chapter in DreamWorks Animation’s blockbuster musical franchise: Trolls Band Together. \n\nAfter two films of true friendship and relentless flirting, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) are now officially, finally, a couple (#broppy)! As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past. He was once part of her favorite boyband phenomenon, BroZone, with his four brothers: Floyd (Golden Globe nominated electropop sensation Troye Sivan), John Dory (Eric André; Sing 2), Spruce (Grammy winner Daveed Diggs; Hamilton) and Clay (Grammy winner Kid Cudi; Don’t Look Up). BroZone disbanded when Branch was still a baby, as did the family, and Branch hasn’t seen his brothers since.  \n\nBut when Branch’s bro Floyd is kidnapped for his musical talents by a pair of nefarious pop-star villains—Velvet (Emmy winner Amy Schumer; Trainwreck) and Veneer (Grammy winner and Tony nominee Andrew Rannells; The Book of Mormon)—Branch and Poppy embark on a harrowing and emotional journey to reunite the other brothers and rescue Floyd from a fate even worse than pop-culture obscurity. \n\nFeaturing Trolls’ signature psychedelic joy-bomb of new and classic pop hits, Trolls Band Together stars a dazzling cast of musical superstars and comedic powerhouses as new franchise characters, including four-time Grammy nominee and Latin Grammy winner Camila Cabello (Cinderella) as Viva; Zosia Mamet (The Flight Attendant) as Crimp; and 12-time Emmy winning drag icon RuPaul Charles as Miss Maxine. \n\nThe returning cast includes Grammy, Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Zooey Deschanel as Bridget; Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Gristle, the Icona Pop duo Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt as Satin and Chenille, Grammy winner Anderson .Paak as Prince D, comedian Ron Funches as Cooper, SAG nominee Kunal Nayyar as Guy Diamond and Emmy winning Saturday Night Live legend Kenan Thompson as Tiny Diamond. \n\nTrolls Band Together is steered by returning director Walt Dohrn and producer Gina Shay, and is co-directed by Tim Heitz (head of story, Trolls World Tour). DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls films—2016’s Trolls and 2020’s Trolls World Tour—have sung and danced their way to record-breaking success, earning an Oscar® nomination for Best Original Song and fueling one of the largest and most beloved entertainment brands in the world.\n\nSocial:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DreamWorksTrolls   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/trolls \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/trolls \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@trolls \nWebsite: http://www.trollsmovie.com/  \n#TrollsBandTogether\n\nPre-save to be the first to hear music from the movie! https://www.trollssoundtrack.com/","title":"TROLLS BAND TOGETHER | Official Trailer","duration":138,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230328","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ40Z62tcXM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qZ40Z62tcXM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":7292101}}

{"description":"Watch the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor celebrating Adam Sandler on CNN.com or CNNgo.\n\nhttps://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nThe Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, was awarded to Adam Sandler at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy -- including Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Ben Stiller, Dana Carvey, Pete Davidson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Anniston, Idina Menzel, David Spade, and more -- on March 19, 2023, and aired nationally on CNN on March 26, 2023.\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\n“Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,” said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to bring together the best in comedy.”\n\n#MarkTwainPrize #AdamSandler #kennedycenter #cnn \n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Adam Sandler Acceptance Speech | 2023 Mark Twain Prize","duration":692,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20230327","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CukbxgucLc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5CukbxgucLc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2852950}}
