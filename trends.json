{"description":"Hey guys! Today is another episode from my series Thrift Store Makeovers, where I take a used, worn out item (OR sometimes from yard sales or  off of ebay) clean it up, fix it up and decorate it. I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. I've definitely missed these thrift flips and I want to do more thrifting soon.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

{"description":"Meet the updated Tesla Model 3! \n\nIt‚Äôs been 7 years since the Model 3 was first unveiled, and this is the biggest design overhaul yet! The question is, how much has changed? Well, Mat‚Äôs got hands-on with the car to take a closer look. \n\nIn terms of the design, there are a few notable changes. Up top, there are a pair of slimmer, sleeker headlights, and there‚Äôs also a big central vent as part of the bumper. This helps give it a more aggressive look compared to the previous model. The side profile remains pretty similar to before, apart from a set of new alloy wheel designs. Around the back, the Model 3 comes with updated taillights and a new bumper. The car is also available in a couple of new, exclusive paint colours! \n\nOn the inside, the look and feel are still pretty similar to before, but there are a couple of notable differences. While the large landscape infotainment screen remains, the dash around it has been updated, with new LED lights added to it. There a better quality materials to be found throughout the cabin compared to before, and the infotainment system has been updated and is much quicker and more responsive than before. The indicator buttons have now also been integrated into the steering wheel. \n\nWhen it comes to performance, the Model 3 still comes with a single-motor RWD edition and a dual-motor long-range edition. However, aerodynamic improvements and overall performance updates mean the car can now travel further, with the single-motor RWD having a range of 346 miles, while the dual-motor can travel for up to 423 miles! \n\nThe new Model 3 won‚Äôt be released in the UK until next year, but thankfully, the price is set to stay pretty similar to before - so you can expect entry-level models to cost around ¬£42,000. But will it be worth the wait? You‚Äôll need to stick with Mat and see for yourself!\n\nConfigure a Tesla Model 3 with carwow: https://bit.ly/Configure-A-Model-3\n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n00:27 Design\n01:50 Interior\n02:45 Noise\n03:45 Suspension\n04:21 Infotainment\n05:36 Back Seats\n06:15 Efficiency\n06:47 Range\n07:02 Price & Release\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"New Tesla Model 3 - what's changed?","duration":481,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230901","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ6zIHHMlSs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gQ6zIHHMlSs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1832337}}

Kandi‚Äôs sights are set on gaining EGOT status as a two-time Broadway producer, actress, singer, and now podcast host. With several business moves on the horizon, she‚Äôs trying to balance prioritizing family time with supporting her husband and business partner, Todd, in his journey to Hollywood as a filmmaker‚Ä¶ just as he always supports her. Will Kandi be able to put in the time and energy needed to help Todd and achieve her future aspirations? Kenya is in full boss mode. The hair-care mogul is taking her business to the next level by opening her very own hair salon. While Kenya is still having fun as she twirls her way back into the dating world, the one lingering issue is the finalizing of her divorce. Shere√© is stepping into her greatness after suffering public humiliation when her last relationship didn‚Äôt go as planned. But she didn‚Äôt let that get in the way of giving love a second chance with the new man in her life, Martell Holt. However, as she faces an unexpected health issue, she will have to shift all her focus. Will there be enough Shere√© to go around? Drew is taking her music career to new octaves by releasing her first album, pushing forward her acting and music career simultaneously while also working through her relationship with her husband, Ralph. But they strike the wrong chord in their marriage, and their divorce announcement leaves everyone shaken. As Marlo continues to take on her role as ‚ÄúMunty,‚Äù she‚Äôs working with a life coach while raising teenagers who are ready for summer jobs and driving lessons. She also takes a dip in the dating pool while she looks for her next suitor‚Äîbut not without the approval of her nephews. Returning for her sophomore season, Sanya has no plans to slow down and has her sights set on expanding her business and family. Sanya and husband Aaron still have a full house of nine, all with their own set of challenges. As Sanya navigates the great expectations for her family, business, and more of herself, is she running a marathon with no end in sight? Friend Monyetta is back in the mix playing matchmaker when she introduces Kenya to a new love interest. Monyetta is trying to be a good friend while managing the tough waters of being loyal to Kandi while showing the other ladies she can be true to them as well. Courtney also joins this season as a friend. She‚Äôs a successful brand marketing expert and jewelry designer in Atlanta who has been friends with Shere√© for many years. Courtney realizes her strong ties to this group when she finds out her long-lost cousin is Drew‚Äôs husband, Ralph. However, with friendships on the brink, accusations causing a fuss, and divorce news that‚Äôs all too much, will these women be able to channel positive vibes?\n\nCast:\nKandi Burruss\nKenya Moore\nShere√© Whitfield\nDrew Sidora\nMarlo Hampton\nSanya Richards-Ross\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

It was developed in America in the 1970's by George Wright and gets it's name from the Phoenix workshops. It is classified as a downdraft kiln because the flames go up into the ware chamber and then down to the exit flue of the ware chambers before going up a chimney. I built one from mud to learn about how it works and to see how hot it gets. \nThe mud I used for the kiln is white clay from a flood area and it less than ideal for making pottery. \nI tested it and it worked ok but I knocked out the exit flue wall to make it behave more like a cross draft kiln before firing the pots. The kiln worked well in firing pottery despite the poor quality clay which cracked easily. If run for longer it probably would have reached higher temperatures. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Starfield reviewed on PC and Xbox Series X by Dan Stapleton.\nIt‚Äôs never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours, but that‚Äôs very much the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it. There are a lot of forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management, and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive. I‚Äôm glad that I powered through the early hours, because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got rolling, combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I‚Äôd finished the main story after around 60 hours. Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there‚Äôs still an immense amount of quality roleplaying quests and interesting NPCs out there, waiting to be stumbled across, and the pull to seek it out is strong.","title":"Starfield Review","duration":742,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMMNkfSQuiU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/nMMNkfSQuiU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1662728}}

{"description":"OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH is based (very) loosely on the true adventures of 18th century would-be pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby). After trading the seemingly charmed life of a gentleman for one of a swashbuckling buccaneer, Stede became captain of the pirate ship Revenge. Struggling to earn the respect of his potentially mutinous crew, Stede‚Äôs fortunes changed after a fateful run-in with the infamous Captain Blackbeard (Taika Waititi). To their surprise, the wildly different Stede and Blackbeard found more than friendship on the high seas‚Ä¶they found love. Now, they have to survive it.\n\nSeason 2 of OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH premieres October 5, only on Max.\n\nAbout Max:\nMax is the culture-defining entertainment service for every mood.

{"description":"Tropical Storm Idalia descended on the Carolinas on its way out to the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday, leaving a trail of flooding and destruction throughout the Southeast that stretched back to its landfall as a hurricane in Florida.\n\nRescue and repair efforts continued in the areas the storm passed Wednesday and there was no immediate word on the toll from the ferocious winds and inundating waters, but authorities counted at least one death.\n\nThe storm left as many as a half-million customers without power in Florida and other states at one point as it ripped down power poles and lines. Still, it was far less destructive than feared, providing only glancing blows to Tampa Bay and other more populated areas as it came ashore with 125 mph (201 kph) winds in rural Florida.\n\nThe weakening storm still packed winds of up to 60 mph (96 kph) as it blasted through Georgia and South Carolina on Wednesday evening. It was expected to reach the North Carolina coast Thursday and roll off into the ocean through the weekend.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who declared a statewide emergency earlier this week as Idalia approached, had warned residents in coastal and eastern inland counties to prepare for heavy rainfall and localized flooding and urged them to stay off roads covered by water.\n\nIn South Carolina, the storm coupled with king tides to send seawater flowing over sand dunes and spilling onto beachfront streets. In Charleston, a surge from Idalia topped the seawall that protects the downtown, sending ankle-deep ocean water into the streets and neighborhoods where horse-drawn carriages pass million-dollar homes and the famous open-air market.\n\nPreliminary data showed the Wednesday evening high tide reached just over 9.2 feet (2.8 meters), more than 3 feet (0.9 meters) above normal and the fifth-highest reading in Charleston Harbor since records were first kept in 1899.\n\nBands from Idalia also brought short-lived tornadoes. One flipped a car in suburban Goose Creek, South Carolina, causing minor injuries, authorities said. No major damage was reported.\n\nAfter traveling across the Gulf of Mexico, Idalia came ashore Wednesday morning near Keaton Beach, pummeling Florida‚Äôs remote and lightly populated Big Bend region with powerful winds.\n\nThe area, where the Florida Panhandle curves into the peninsula, saw streets turned into rivers that submerged cars and homes, while the howling winds tore off roofs, snapped tall trees, sent sheet metal flying and shredded homes.\n\n‚ÄúAll hell broke loose,‚Äù said Belond Thomas of Perry, a mill town located just inland from the Big Bend region. Thomas fled with her family and some friends to a motel, thinking it would be safer than riding out the storm at home but the roof was torn away and debris showered onto her pregnant daughter, who fortunately wasn‚Äôt injured, Thomas said.\n\nNo hurricane-related deaths were officially confirmed in Florida, but the state's highway patrol reported two people killed in separate weather-related crashes just hours before Idalia made landfall.\n\nEven so, Idalia appeared to be far less destructive than first feared. It avoided large urban regions, striking only glancing blows to Tampa Bay and other more populated areas while focusing its fury on the rural Big Bend section.\n\nHowever, damage there was likely to be extensive.\n\nAt Horseshoe Beach in central Big Bend, Jewell Baggett picked through the wreckage and debris of her mother‚Äôs destroyed home, finding a few pictures and her mother‚Äôs pots and pans.\n\nHer grandfather built the home decades ago and it had survived four previous storms, she said.\n\n‚ÄúAnd now it‚Äôs gone,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNothing left. A few little trinkets here and there.‚Äù\n\nBaggett, whose mother had left before the storm hit, said at least five or six other homes also were destroyed.\n\nIn Tallahassee, the power went out well before the center of the storm arrived, but the city avoided a direct hit. A giant oak tree next to the governor‚Äôs mansion split in half, covering the yard with debris.\n\nState officials, 5,500 National Guardsman and rescue crews went into search-and-recovery mode, inspecting bridges, clearing toppled trees and looking for anyone in distress. More than 30,000 utility workers gathered to repair downed power lines and poles.\n\nREAD MORE: https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/tropical-storm-idalia-north-carolina/507-6ab5b730-ea2a-4c37-93e0-48fc677b55ff","title":"Hurricane Idalia devastation seen across social media","duration":149,"channel_id":"UCcT6w3xUyVshyR2_2vrMp1w","author":"WUSA9","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4NclqJ87QQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4NclqJ87QQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":604485}}

Throughout this video we're gonna be going through it all but if you enjoy the video make sure you hit the thumbs up button and subscribe you will for videos like this every day.\n\nWith that out the way, thanks for clicking this, now let's get into Ahsoka.\n\n-\n\nSo last week saw a Super Star Destroyer Hypedrive been brought to the eye of Sion in order to give Morgan Elsbeth a pathway to Thrawn. Based on the Jedi hyperdrive rings this would allow the nightsister to finally bring him back after he was taken away in the rebels finales.\n\nThough last week we thought Sion might be a reference to Darth Sion it's true meaning is probbaly more inline with the literary meaning which defines a mystical utopia. The word also shares similarities to the word Scion which means heir. Thraw was known as the heir to the empire showing that it's all connected.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"AHSOKA Episode 3 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Rebels Easter Eggs, Theories & Review","duration":1403,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdtH_F9InJw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdtH_F9InJw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":279958}}

{"description":"It has been a long road, but we finally made it.  I'm now about 60 hours in Starfield on PC, and after completing the main questline and several factions, I've realized there is still a massive amount of content to tackle.  Starfield hits differently for me than Skyrim - not better or worse...just different.  It takes time to settle in and grow on you.  Quests, writing and game performance all stand out as well done.  Is this the best BGS release ever?

You will join Constellation ‚Äì the last group of space explorers seeking rare artifacts throughout the galaxy ‚Äì and navigate the vast expanse of space in Bethesda Game Studios‚Äô biggest and most ambitious game.\nTell Your story\nIn Starfield the most important story is the one you tell with your character. Start your journey by customizing your appearance and deciding your Background and Traits. Will you be an experienced explorer, a charming diplomat, a stealthy cyber runner, or something else entirely? The choice is yours. Decide who you will be and what you will become.\nExplore Outer Space\nVenture through the stars and explore more than 1000 planets. Navigate bustling cities, explore dangerous bases, and traverse wild landscapes. Meet and recruit a memorable cast of characters, join in the adventures of various factions, and embark on quests across the Settled Systems. A new story or experience is always waiting to be discovered.\nCaptain the Ship Of Your Dreams\nPilot and command the ship of your dreams. Personalize the look of your ship, modify critical systems including weapons and shields, and assign crew members to provide unique bonuses. In deep space you will engage in high-stakes dogfights, encounter random missions, dock at star stations, and even board and commandeer enemy ships to add to your collection.\nDiscover, Collect, Build\nExplore planets and discover the fauna, flora, and resources needed to craft everything from medicine and food to equipment and weapons. Build outposts and hire a crew to passively extract materials and establish cargo links to transfer resources between them. Invest these raw materials into research projects to unlock unique crafting recipes.\nLock and Load\n_______________________________________________________________\nPC Specs:\n‚ñ∫Cooler Master Case\n‚ñ∫ASUS Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WIFI AMD Threadripper Pro EATX workstation motherboard\n‚ñ∫AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3975WX\n‚ñ∫DDR4 3600MHz Corsair Vengeance LPX (8x32GB) \n‚ñ∫Corsair RM1000 Watt Power Supply\n‚ñ∫Nvidia Geforce 3090 Founders Edition\n‚ñ∫OS  Windows 10 Professional 64-Bit\n‚ñ∫Acer Predator XB273K 27\" UHD (3840 x 2160) IPS NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible Monitor w VESA\n‚ñ∫Acer Predator XB271HU 27\" WQHD (2560 x 1440) NVIDIA G-Sync Widescreen Display x 2\n‚ñ∫Sennheiser HD 598 Special Edition Over-Ear Headphones\n‚ñ∫Corsair Gaming K70 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard\n‚ñ∫RAZER Deathadder Elite Mouse\n‚ñ∫RAZER Tartarus Chroma Gamepad\n‚ñ∫Rode NT-USB USB Condenser Microphone \n‚ñ∫Vertagear S-Line SL5000 Racing Series Gaming Chair\n\nüé∂‚ñ∫Background Tracks\n\nüé∂ Punch Deck - Walk With The Fire\nLicense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\nDownload Free: https://soundcloud.com/punch-deck/wal...\nüé∂ Punch Deck - Homestead\nLicense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\nDownload Free: https://soundcloud.com/punch-deck/homestead\nüé∂ 'Artemis' by Scott Buckley\nreleased under CC-BY 4.0. www.scottbuckley.com.au\nüé∂ 'Helios' by Scott Buckley\nreleased under CC-BY 4.0. www.scottbuckley.com.au\n\n@LtBuzzLitebeer @bethesda @IGN @Microsoft @xbox  \n\n#starfield #xbox #games #rpg #microsoft #starcitizen #skyrim #fallout4 #bethesda","title":"Is Starfield Really THAT Good? - (Spoiler Free Review)","duration":1146,"channel_id":"UCQnZTXSn-Me7D6bmqME3osA","author":"LtBuzzLitebeer","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--mSrBth6hY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/--mSrBth6hY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":164147}}
