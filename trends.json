{"description":"“I’m gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight.” Don’t miss Austin Butler and Tom Hanks in THE film of the summer. See Baz Luhrmann’s #ElvisMovie only in theaters June 24. ⚡️ #TCB \n\nhttps://elvis.warnerbros.com \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ElvisMovie \nhttps://www.instagram.com/ElvisMovie \nhttps://twitter.com/ElvisMovie \n\nELVIS is an epic, big-screen spectacle from Warner Bros. Pictures and visionary, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Baz Luhrmann that explores the life and music of Elvis Presley, starring Austin Butler and Oscar winner Tom Hanks. \n\nA thoroughly cinematic drama, Elvis’s (Butler) story is seen through the prism of his complicated relationship with his enigmatic manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Hanks). As told by Parker, the film delves into the complex dynamic between the two spanning over 20 years, from Presley’s rise to fame to his unprecedented stardom, against the backdrop of the evolving cultural landscape and loss of innocence in America. Central to that journey is one of the significant and influential people in Elvis’s life, Priscilla Presley (Olivia DeJonge). \n\nStarring alongside Butler and Hanks, award-winning theatre actress Helen Thomson (“Top of the Lake: China Girl,” “Rake”) plays Elvis’s mother, Gladys, Richard Roxburgh (“Moulin Rouge!” “Breath,” “Hacksaw Ridge”) portrays Elvis’s father, Vernon, and DeJonge (“The Visit,” “Stray Dolls”) plays Priscilla. Luke Bracey (“Hacksaw Ridge,” “Point Break”) plays Jerry Schilling, Natasha Bassett (“Hail, Caesar!”) plays Dixie Locke, David Wenham (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Lion,” “300”) plays Hank Snow, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (“The Trial of the Chicago 7,” “The High Note”) plays B.B. King, Xavier Samuel (“Adore,” “Love & Friendship,” “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse”) plays Scotty Moore, and Kodi Smit-McPhee (“The Power of the Dog”) plays Jimmie Rodgers Snow. \n\nAlso in the cast, Dacre Montgomery (“Stranger Things,” “The Broken Heart Gallery”) plays TV director Steve Binder, alongside Australian actors Leon Ford (“Gallipoli,” “The Pacific”) as Tom Diskin, Kate Mulvany (“The Great Gatsby,” “Hunters”) as Marion Keisker, Gareth Davies (“Peter Rabbit,” “Hunters”) as Bones Howe, Charles Grounds (“Crazy Rich Asians,” “Camp”) as Billy Smith, Josh McConville (“Fantasy Island”) as Sam Phillips, and Adam Dunn (“Home and Away”) as Bill Black. \n\nTo play additional iconic musical artists in the film, Luhrmann cast singer/songwriter Yola as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, model Alton Mason as Little Richard, Austin, Texas native Gary Clark Jr. as Arthur Crudup, and artist Shonka Dukureh as Willie Mae “Big Mama” Thornton. \n\nOscar nominee Luhrmann (“The Great Gatsby,” “Moulin Rouge!”) directed from a screenplay by Baz Luhrmann & Sam Bromell and Baz Luhrmann & Craig Pearce and Jeremy Doner, story by Baz Luhrmann and Jeremy Doner. The film’s producers are Luhrmann, Oscar winner Catherine Martin (“The Great Gatsby,” “Moulin Rouge!”), Gail Berman, Patrick McCormick and Schuyler Weiss. Toby Emmerich, Courtenay Valenti and Kevin McCormick executive produced. \n\nThe director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Mandy Walker (“Mulan,” “Australia”), Oscar-winning production designer and costume designer Catherine Martin (“The Great Gatsby,” “Moulin Rouge!”), production designer Karen Murphy (“A Star Is Born”), editors Matt Villa (“The Great Gatsby,” “Australia”) and Jonathan Redmond (“The Great Gatsby”), Oscar-nominated visual effects supervisor Thomas Wood (“Mad Max: Fury Road”), music supervisor Anton Monsted (“Australia,” “Moulin Rouge!”) and composer Elliott Wheeler (“The Get Down”). \n\nPrincipal photography on “Elvis” took place in Queensland, Australia with the support of the Queensland Government, Screen Queensland, and the Australian Government’s Producer Offset program. \n\nA Warner Bros. Pictures Presentation, A Bazmark Production, A Jackal Group Production, A Baz Luhrmann Film, “Elvis” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is set to release in theaters in North America on June 24, 2022, and internationally beginning 22 June 2022.","title":"Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS | Official Trailer 2","duration":191,"channel_id":"UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

{"description":"What if funk/fusion drummer Dennis Chambers was the drummer for Tool? \n\n(Don’t tell Danny Carey.)\n\nDennis is known for his legendary backbeat and funky style. So of course we felt mischievous and we dared him to try playing “Schism”, one of Tool’s biggest songs. It’s full of odd time signatures, quick, complex changes and unexpected accents, and Dennis had never heard it before.\n\nBut we didn’t ask him to learn the real drum parts: we wanted to see what he’d come up with on his own after hearing the song once. While you’ll hear the song with drums in this video, Dennis was actually listening to a drumless track.\n\n“This is not me,” he warned us as he listened through the track, but “in my younger days, this would’ve been up my alley!”\n\nHow will Dennis Chambers not only learn a song he’s never heard before, but in a style he’s unfamiliar with – and in odd time, at that?\n\nSince the song doesn’t have a drum track, he listens for two things: the style and the time signature.

{"description":"KEFIR WEBSITE HERE: https://www.happyherbalist.com\n\nFind out how this simple remedy can help you sleep better. \n\nDATA:\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146643#\nhttps://www.ffhdj.com/index.php/ffhd/article/view/572#:\nhttps://www.happyherbalist.com/kefir-live-grains-milk-kefir/\n\n0:00 Introduction: The best natural remedy for sleep \n0:20 What is kefir? \n1:27 Kefir benefits \n1:45 Kefir for better sleep \n3:55 The best type of kefir to consume \n4:30 How to make kefir \n5:40 Check out my video on other things that help promote sleep!\n\nSleep is so important, and I believe this remedy will help you get the sleep you need. The best natural remedy for sleep is kefir. Consume 1/2 cup of kefir before bed for better sleep. \n\nKefir is similar to yogurt, but it’s better. It has more healthy, diverse microbes than yogurt. Many of these friendly microbes also survive your stomach acids, whereas the microbes in yogurt don’t.\n\nKefir not only has friendly bacteria but friendly yeast, too. This combination is essential. People with lactose intolerance also have an easier time digesting kefir than yogurt. \n\nHealth benefits of kefir:\n • Decreased liver fat \n • Fewer allergy symptoms \n • Improved immune system \n • Decreased inflammation \n • Less constipation \n • Better blood sugar \n • Better blood pressure \n • Decreased pathogens \n\nCertain microbes make serotonin. The more of the right microbes you have, the more serotonin you’ll have. Serotonin is a hormone that can positively affect your mood and reduce stress. \n\nKefir provides microbes that make melatonin, which is a sleep hormone. Not only that, but kefir contains microbes that make the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan turns into serotonin and then melatonin. \n\nKefir is a good source of bioavailable calcium, which can help you get to sleep and stay asleep. The microbes in kefir also make certain B vitamins, which can greatly help with stress and calm a busy mind. The lactobacillus in kefir helps reduce cortisol, which will also help you sleep better. \n\nI highly recommend making your own kefir. You need something called kefir live grains (there is no grain in it) to get started. \n\nI like using goat milk, but you can use cow milk. The website I use to buy my kefir grains (happyherbalist.com) explains exactly how to make kefir. \n\nBasically, you add 1 Tbsp of the kefir grains to 1 to 2 cups of milk. Then, you set it on the counter and cover it using a cloth or paper towel and a rubber band. After 24 hours, you’ll have kefir. \n\nADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:\nhttps://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description\n\nFREE COURSE➜ ➜ http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse\n\nTalk to a Product Advisor to find the best product for you!\nCall 1-540-299-1556 with your questions about Dr. Berg's products.

{"description":"This has been a long time coming. Anyone who watches this channel knows I love night riding, but until now I have never attempted to ride Berm Peak at night. This is due to a variety of reasons, most of which should be pretty obvious. Bike lights are designed for singletrack—not wallrides and whale tails. Tonight, we throw caution to the wind and give it a shot on my backyard mountain bike trails.\n\nAlso tonight, we’ll test out some new lights from Outbound Lighting. I met the owner of the company at Sedona Mountain Bike Festival, holding down the booth all by himself. Tom is not only an entrepreneur, but an engineer, so we can be sure Outbound’s marketing department isn’t getting in the way of the important stuff. These lights were remarkably simple, free of gimmicks, very well thought out, and very bright. They also turn on and off with simple taps of the power button instead of confounding combinations that so many other manufacturers insist on. Best of all, they’re really fairly priced for what you’re getting. So I’m going to run these long term and see how they work out!\n\nTrail Evo (flood light) https://www.outboundlighting.com/products/trail-evo-bike-light\nHangover (spot light) https://www.outboundlighting.com/products/hangover-bike-helmet-light\n\nBerm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts\nhttps://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nWant us to review your unique mountain bike or outdoor product? https://www.sethsbikehacks.com/product-review/\n\nCheck out our main channel https://youtube.com/c/sethsbikehacks\nFollow me on Instagram https://instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nBerm Peak Merch https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nMusic in this video is from \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg\nand https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20\n\nJoin my Patreon and 100% of the proceeds go towards projects in the mountain biking community.

{"description":"Today’s Roblox In a Nutshell will be on Bee Swarm Simulator.\n\nRoblox Bee Swarm simulator is a classic Roblox simulator game where you walk around with your bees to collect pollen and honey so you can get better equipment to get pollen and honey faster.\n\nLike all the other Roblox simulator games, the objective is to get STRONG and RICH. To get from noob to pro, the player needs to buy more bees, improve their bee hive, buy better equipment, complete quests, kill mobs, complete challenges, and use codes to get some items. The better stuff the player gets, the more honey and pollen they will gather. The game is very grindy, just like all other simulators, and most people would use macros or scripts to farm.\n\nThere are 45 types of bees, and they all have different stats and abilities. Since the maximum number of bees a player can have is 50, they need to find the best hive build (combination of bees) to get honey fast. Rarer bees are usually higher on the tier list, and some, like the windy bee, are hard to obtain.\n\nOn top of bees, people need to grind for equipment and items like Tide Popper, Dark Scythe, Gummyballer, translator, and The Planter Of Plenty to farm more efficiently. They let the player gather more pollen, unlock new quests and drop better stuff.\n\nThis video will show you everything there is to the game. It is not a complete guide, but there are some tips you can follow to get more honey. \n\nLike always, this video is filled with a crap ton of dead memes in the form of funny moments/montages. Bee Swarm Simulator used to have events like the Christmas 2021 event with snowflakes and gingerbread bears, but since then, there has been no update. I hope you enjoyed this Bee Swarm Simulator video. Don’t forget to subscribe and spam E.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis video contains a crap load of dead memes and bad jokes.

Meet friendly bears, complete their quests and get rewards! As your hive grows larger and larger, you can explore further up the mountain. Use your bees to defeat dangerous bugs and monsters. Look for treasures hidden around the map. Discover new types of bees, all with their own traits and personalities!\n\nWhat is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.","title":"Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator In A Nutshell","duration":871,"channel_id":"UCH6sNLmH-rsATLffdpGYscQ","author":"Tank Fish","date":"20220521","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsCPBinDLg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LLsCPBinDLg/hqdefault.jpg?v=62873151","content":{"View count":788575}}

Each house (SpongeBob Squarepants, Squidward Tentacles and Patrick Star) were incredibly hard to print. I'm so happy with how Bikini Bottom turned out and my sister couldn't believe the special surprise at the end! \n\nAs you may know, Petco sells SpongeBob Squarepants' houses for fish tanks, but they are just too small. I wanted to make Bikini Bottom for a much larger fish tank so I took matters into my own hands. I used a 3D printer to make Bikini Bottom in this fish tank. PLA is both food and fish safe and great for making aquarium ornaments and parts. \n\nIf you have any comments, suggestions or questions, leave them down in the comments!

{"description":"Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 - OFFICIAL TRAILER | NetPro Trailer Version\n\nThis trailer is a concept-mashup that shows my idea of ​​how the teaser trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 might look like.       \n____________________________________________\n◖Made/Edited By NetPro ◗\n▻ netfl.pro192@gmail.com\n____________________________________________\n\n◅ On our channel we create а trailer mashups ▻\nalso known as recut trailers, involve collecting multiple pieces of film footage from one or multiple movies and editing them to create a new trailer. Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.\n\nThere is no intention of infringing on anyone's intellectual property. This is not intended to deceive or defraud anyone; rather, it is intended to give fans a taste of what the film may be like. I don't own the material; I simply produce trailers for fans and others who are excited about a movie.\n\nThe trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.\n____________________________________________\n\nAbout Poppy Playtime:\n\nA survival horror video game with puzzle elements, developed and published by indie developer MOB Games. It was released on Steam for Windows on October 12, 2021. The game tells the story of a former employee who visits an abandoned factory of children's toys, formerly owned by the gaming company Playtime Co., 10 years after its employees disappeared without a trace.","title":"Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 - OFFICIAL TRAILER | NetPro Trailer Version","duration":59,"channel_id":"UCgLKyuJH2kaZX5sIJLKZ_aQ","author":"NetPro","date":"20220520","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_eq8lLBop8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V_eq8lLBop8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2281610}}
