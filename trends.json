{"description":"Two-division world champion Danny ‚ÄúSwift Garcia dominated in his super welterweight debut Saturday night, cruising to a majority decision victory over exciting contender Jose Benavidez Jr. in the SHOWTIME main event from Barclays Center in Brooklyn headlining a Premier Boxing Champions event. He saved perhaps his most expressive moment post-fight when he broke down in the ring discussing his struggles with mental health with SHOWTIME reporter Jim Gray, showing the authenticity that has made him such a fan-favorite in Brooklyn. \n \n‚ÄúI did take a break going through mental things, things went dark, I went through anxiety, deep depression, just trying to be strong,‚Äù said a visibly emotional Garcia. ‚ÄúIt was the pressure of life, being a good dad, just letting it out right now, because it was all stuck inside. It rained on me for a year and a half and the only way to do better was to fight again. I‚Äôm a fighter. If you battle anxiety and depression, you can get out of it, that‚Äôs what I did today. I fought.‚Äù\n \nPhiladelphia‚Äôs Garcia (37-3, 21 KOs) has become a staple at Barclays Center ever since headlining the arena‚Äôs first boxing event in 2012, and his return on Saturday night against Benavidez (27-2-1, 18 KOs), saw him pick up his seventh victory in Brooklyn.\n\n#DannyGarcia #JoseBenavidez #GarciaBenavidez\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Garcia vs Benavidez HIGHLIGHTS: July 30, 2022 | PBC on Showtime","duration":84,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20220731","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1vtJsi8KY8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G1vtJsi8KY8/hqdefault.jpg?v=62e6384c","content":{"View count":222955}}

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ‚ñ∫https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ ‚ñ∫https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson","title":"Grain Bin Clean Out","duration":1467,"channel_id":"UCp0rRUsMDlJ1meYAQ6_37Dw","author":"Millennial Farmer","date":"20220730","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4vIxEGYqVs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/j4vIxEGYqVs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":215438}}

I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

{"description":"California's \"train to nowhere\" shows the challenges ahead.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn 2008, voters in California passed Proposition 1A, giving the state the go-ahead to build a high-speed rail line. In theory, it was a great idea. The train would whisk passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than 3 hours. Eventually it would also link San Diego and Sacramento. It was estimated that it would take until 2020 to complete. \n\nBut now it‚Äôs 2022, and so far California‚Äôs high-speed rail line is just a few concrete bridges and viaducts strewn across the rural Central Valley. Much of the plan had to be changed, redesigned, or even abandoned all together. Now the project is decades late and way over budget. And that isn‚Äôt just California‚Äôs problem. Because among the many factors that plagued the project, several are baked into the power structure of the US itself.\n\nWatch the video above to understand just how difficult the US makes it to build infrastructure like California‚Äôs high-speed rail line. \n\nChapters:\nCalifornia‚Äôs plan: 00:00\nLocal control: 1:48\nFederal funding: 3:45\nLawsuits: 5:09\nThe experience gap: 6:37\n\nFurther reading and sources: \n\nYou can find more of Ethan Elkind‚Äôs high-speed rail research and analysis here:\nhttps://www.ethanelkind.com/category/high-speed-rail/\n\nAnd we highly recommend reading Ralph Vartabedian and Tim Sheehan‚Äôs reporting to learn more about how this project has affected communities on the ground: \nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-29/california-bullet-train-impacts-disadvantaged-communities-san-joaquin-valley\nhttps://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/high-speed-rail/article260855207.html \n\nThe California-High Speed Rail Authority‚Äôs 2022 business plan was a key source for mapping the routes in this video: \nhttps://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Business-Plan-FINAL-A11Y.pdf\n\nOlder business plans, like this one from 2005, helped us understand which alternate routes were being considered before the 2008 vote:\nhttps://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/programs/eir-eis/State_Wide_EIR_EIS_Volume_1_Part_1_of_3.pdf\n\nThis is the 2015 CEQA lawsuit report we refer to in the video: \nhttps://issuu.com/hollandknight/docs/ceqa_litigation_abuseissuu?e=16627326/14197714 \n\nOverall infrastructure spending in the US is an important part of this story, and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation had a lot of helpful resources. The video uses data from this report in charts on state and federal spending: https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/06/state-and-local-infrastructure-spending-a-closer-look\n\nExactly how much the federal government ended up spending on this project and when can be hard to pin down, but funding agreement documents like the ones below are publicly available and very useful: \nhttps://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/about/funding_finance/funding_agreements/HSRFRA_CooperativeGrantAgreement_Amendment6_051816_Redacted.pdf\nhttps://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/about/funding_finance/funding_agreements/Executed_FY10_Amendment_1.pdf \n\nWe also found this funding timeline from the Eno Center for Transportation extremely helpful in understanding the funding and cost projections related to CAHSR:\nhttps://www.enotrans.org/article/timeline-california-high-speed-rail-cost-estimates/\n\nA key part of this story is understanding how far behind its peers the US is in building high-speed rail. This fact sheet on global HSR from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute offers valuable insights on that:\nhttps://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide\n\nAnd this 2013 report from the California Rail Foundation helped us understand some of the political compromises made in the planning of this project: http://calrailfoundation.org/HSR_files/crn713webcen2.pdf\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

So, after a lot of watching from the sidelines, I decided that I needed to try this out for myself - how hard could it actually be? So I ventured to Lofty Pursuits candy store in Tallahassee, FL where Greg & the team taught me how to sling candy - old school style. We made custom flavored drop candy in a press, and two different batches of image candy - one watermelon, and one tiny disgruntled alien.

{"description":"SUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUnxiP7q4RDDyeioZFZLnXA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGET MERCH HERE: https://www.pivotpodcast.com\n\nWe have had our¬†biggest Pivot guest in Shaq and now today, he may be our smallest guest but by far the biggest show we've done...Kevin Hart joins the Pivot and we promise we didn't F**k this one up!\n\nWith nothing off limits, this conversation is the perfect blend of insightful stories, life experiences and sound advice with some \"light-harted\"¬†moments as Ryan, Channing and Fred talk with Kevin about everything from his career to family to personal miscues¬†to getting to the top and staying there.¬†¬†\n\nStraight off the stage at Madison Square Garden with Chris Rock and Dave Chapelle, Kevin sits down with us and is very candid about how his journey has evolved and his addiction to winning motivates him everyday to keep being better and expanding. Stressing the power of collaborations and relationships, Kevin says there is room for more than one great in a certain space and sharing success is the best way to stay at the top, recognizing that, the blessing and the curse, is the sacrifices we make to get where we want to be.¬†\n\nRyan asks Kevin how living out some of his personal relationship issues in the public eye with his¬†first marriage and now his second, never affected his¬†persona or allowed scandals to be larger than the purpose. \n\nKevin opens up on how being honest and owning his mistakes publicly allowed him to move forward and also earn respect and grace along the way. Nobody is perfect and when we realize that everyone messes up, it's easier to block out the people who don't matter and focus on what does. Kevin explains how he turned his miscues into humor allowing art to imitate life and became better for it.¬†\n\nLeave it to Channing to derail the conversation as he tries to ask a simple question that pivots the show into an entirely different direction that gives Kevin an up close and personal look into the wild mind of Channing but it doesn't take for Channing to realize he has met his match as Kevin fires back and it's priceless.¬†\n\nGetting into a little Philadelphia history, Fred talks about some of the greats and people Kevin admires from his hometown with the long history of stars. As we get ready to head off to our NFL training camp tour, Ryan couldn't help but ask Kevin about his infamous Philly Super Bowl Snub a few years ago and the story is just as funny now as it was back then.¬†\n\nNew Episodes of the Pivot premiere every Tuesday at Noon eastern with special drops on Friday afternoons. Since January 4th, We have released¬†over 50 episodes, accumulated over 40 million views and have almost 500K subscribers. As We wrap our first season and prepare to hit the road to start our NFL Training camp Tour next Tuesday, we will be¬†bringing you some of the best football guests in the NFL cities we visit- it's going to be a wild ride so thank you for sticking with us and making this PIVOT with us!¬†\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HAPPY DAD: https://youtube.com/channel/UCRVEzpUvlbs06pNZ1WSzg2A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFOLLOW THE PIVOT PODCAST:\nINSTAGRAM | https://instagram.com/thepivot\nTWITTER | https://twitter.com/thepivot\nTIKTOK | https://tiktok.com/@thepivot\nFACEBOOK | https://facebook.com/thepivotpodcast\nSPOTIFY | https://open.spotify.com/show/5KtXTWiC3J5WW1CVTpYG5V\nAPPLE PODCASTS | https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pivot-podcast/id1603292451\n\n#ThePivot\n#Podcast\n#ChanningCrowder\n#FredTaylor\n#RyanClark\n#HappyDad","title":"Kevin Hart on Sacrifice, Success & Never Allowing Mistakes to Overshadow Purpose | The Pivot Podcast","duration":4061,"channel_id":"UCUnxiP7q4RDDyeioZFZLnXA","author":"The Pivot Podcast","date":"20220726","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_alcE8PfzbI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_alcE8PfzbI/hqdefault.jpg?v=62e004c9","content":{"View count":1522972}}

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n00:00 The last 6.5 yearsüåé\n02:32 OUR 101st COUNTRY IS‚Ä¶!\n05:02 Therapy is awesome :)\n06:00 Travel day to Country #101!‚úàÔ∏è\n09:25 WE MADE IT\n11:31 Getting lost‚Ä¶part 1\n12:41 First impressions of Country 101\n13:48 Our ‚ÄúGame Plan‚Äù for this trip\n14:40 First traditional breakfast‚Ä¶& a little drama‚òïÔ∏è\n16:20 LOVING this city!

{"description":"Machine Gun Kelly - twin flame (Official Live Performance) \n\nWhether rapping, as he did in the early part of his career, or rocking, as he's doing these days, Machine Gun Kelly is one of those artists who starts fierce and gets fiercer. That impact comes from the punch of emotion at the core of his tunes - the guy comes on strong from the get-go. You can hear it on 2012's \"Wild Boy\" from his 'Lace Up' debut, and it's there on both the 'BINGE' and 'bloom' albums from a few years ago. In May, Billboard said \"there‚Äôs no one on the charts serving balls-to-the-wall rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll decadence like the 31-year-old musician.\" It's hard to disagree. Since he turned a punk-pop corner with blistering guitar tracks such as \"bloody valentine\" - a blitzkrieg bop if there ever was one - the Halsey duet \"forget me too,\" and his blackbear romp \"my ex's best friend,\" he's moved from respected cool guy to flat-out superstar. And he takes the success in stride; the name of his latest album is 'mainstream sellout.' If you caught the Billboard Awards in May, you know he poured it all out in his performance of \"Twin Flame.\" So much so that his sweetie Megan Fox tweeted her approval in a gushing example of PDA. \"Baby ‚Äì so proud of you for giving such a vulnerable and emotional performance. You are magic.\" Fans will think something similar when they're done with our Official Live Performances.
