To keep busy we‚Äôve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMB01F5ZJCRFJBFO","title":"We Left for a Cabin in the Woods","duration":1325,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQGWIkKB8l8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JQGWIkKB8l8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":112970}}

Witness water roaring into basements, stranded vehicles, and impassable roads that brought the Big Apple to a standstill.\n\nThis video dives deep into the heart of the devastation, spotlighting the worst affected regions like Brooklyn and Long Island. From shattered rainfall records to streets that became rivers, experience the magnitude of NYC's epic flood crisis.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 $8k per night villa!\n01:27 Royal Villa tour\n02:00 how did we get here?\n03:04 full resort tour: Conrad Bora Bora\n09:00 Kardashian‚Äôs stayed here!\n12:18 swimming with manta rays\n16:30 Presidential Villa tour!!üôåüèª\n25:00 Nate attempts to win 5 free nightsüòç\n27:45 Bloops","title":"We Stayed in Bora Bora's Most Expensive Overwater Villa","duration":1738,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20231001","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDIp0Vu9iII","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NDIp0Vu9iII/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":643641}}

{"description":"Stephen Thompson | September 29, 2023\nWhat you've got here is a perfect 20-minute distillation of The Sam Smith Experience: The Grammy-winning 2014 ballad that kicked off the singer's career (\"Stay With Me\"), a sleek dance-pop banger (\"How Do You Sleep\") and a chart-topping dollop of debauched hedonism (\"Unholy\") bundled together with \"Lay Me Down,\" in which Smith performed a gorgeous duet with LaDonna Harley-Peters. From the stately to the louche and bawdy ‚Äî Smith even introduced \"Unholy\" with a perfect summation of their recent artistic direction: \"Let's get saucy!\" ‚Äî it's all here.\n\nPerforming with an 11-person choir and two instrumentalists ‚Äî sadly, Kim Petras wasn't there to emerge from between Smith's legs as if she were being birthed ‚Äî Smith brought an overflowing bag of tricks to the proceedings. But what really shone through was a sense of movement: Each song swayed and played effervescently, centering Smith while also elevating every other magnificent voice in support. This set may not serve as anyone's introduction to the music of Sam Smith, but it's still a hell of a gateway ‚Äî and a joy to behold.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Stay With Me\"\n\"How Do You Sleep\"\n\"Lay Me Down (feat.

{"description":"92 %ers, and probably a lot of you entering your ‚Äúfootball era‚Äù, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Accelerator Active Energy! \n\nIn this episode, we break down the Eagles' dominant win on Monday Night Football, how much better this Eagles D-line might be than last year and the right time to go for the hurdle. \n\nWe also recap the most talked about 30-point win in the history of the NFL, the Chiefs' big win against the Bears. We‚Äôll get to why the Chiefs offense is finally clicking, Big Red‚Äôs career milestone, and we finally talk about it, Taylor Swift paid a visit to the Chiefs Kingdom. \n\nAlso, we answer some not-dumb football questions from the Swifties, try and figure out just how the Dolphins dropped 70 on the Broncos, and let you know if we would have kicked the record-breaking field goal. \n\nThis Friday we will be dropping our incredible episode with The Chiefs Chris ‚ÄúStone Cold‚Äù Jones! The guys talk about everything from his new contract, his wardrobe malfunction at the combines, what he likes least about offensive linemen, and why he wants to get lined up against Tyreek Hill. \n\nMake sure you‚Äôre subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don‚Äôt miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nACCELERATOR ACTIVE ENERGY: Available nationwide at Target or visit https://ashoc.com/ to find the store nearest you.  \n\nSTATE FARM: https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/multiline or talk to a State Farm agent today to learn how you can bundle and save with the Personal Price Plan.

Along the way, I've even been hunted by a crazy cat smurf who seemed to be following me around, but now we're finally ready to share the song and music video with all of you.\n\nYou all know how much I value collaboration and the magic that happens when people come together to make music and share experiences. Being a part of this journey has been an absolute honor.

But when the plots of Elly‚Äôs fictional books‚Äîwhich center on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate‚Äîbegin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.\n \nAccompanied by Aiden (Oscar¬Æ winner Sam Rockwell), a cat-allergic spy, Elly (carrying Alfie in her backpack) races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between Elly‚Äôs fictional world and her real one begins to blur.\n \nThe top-flight ensemble cast features Henry Cavill (The Witcher), John Cena (Fast X), Oscar¬Æ winner Ariana DeBose (West Side Story), Grammy winning pop superstar Dua Lipa (Barbie), Emmy winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Emmy winner and comedy icon Catherine O‚ÄôHara (Schitt‚Äôs Creek), Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service), and the legendary Samuel L. Jackson. Alfie is played by Chip, the real-life cat of supermodel Claudia Vaughn (n√©e Schiffer).\n \nArgylle is directed and produced by Matthew Vaughn, from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs (Wonder Woman). The film is produced by Matthew Vaughn, Adam Bohling (Kingsman franchise), Jason Fuchs, and David Reid (Kingsman franchise).

For more information, visit http://www.delta.com/sustainability.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn 2021, President Biden set an ambitious climate goal for the US to reach net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050. And as part of the transition to renewable energy, the country has drastically ramped up production of solar over the past few years. But that‚Äôs led to a new problem: finding enough land on which to put solar panels. \n\nThe easiest and cheapest places to install solar panels are often large, undeveloped plots of land. It's why, in many places across the country, we've seen rural areas ‚Äî including fragile desert ecosystems and valuable farmland ‚Äî turned into solar farms. Many local residents and conservationists have protested these rural solar projects for a variety of reasons: Some want to keep natural views, others want to retain space for agriculture or aim to preserve biodiversity. Solar will likely play an important role in the country‚Äôs move away from fossil fuels ‚Äî but is there a smarter way to do it that doesn‚Äôt require taking up so much rural land?\n\nIn the video above, we explore one option that could help: parking lots. Solar photovoltaics researcher and professor Joshua Pearce goes into the data on how placing solar canopies over parking lots could be a worthwhile investment for many cities. And as more countries, like France, are moving toward retrofitting parking spaces with solar, we look at what it could mean in the US.   \n\nSOURCES:\n\nStudies: \nhttps://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1177&context=materials_fp \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148121000756?via%3Dihub \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03957-7 \nhttps://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/ \n\nFurther reading: \nhttps://e360.yale.edu/features/putting-solar-panels-atop-parking-lots-a-green-energy-solution \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/02/06/france-solar-parking-lots/ \nhttps://www.vox.com/2021/8/18/22556193/solar-energy-biodiversity-birds-pollinator-land \n\nVox is on a mission is to help everyone, regardless of income or status, understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape it.\n\nWatch our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyE\nFollow Vox on TikTok: http://tiktok.com/@voxdotcom\nCheck out our articles: https://www.vox.com/\nListen to our podcasts: https://www.vox.com/podcasts","title":"How to fight climate change with parking lots","duration":511,"channel_id":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","author":"Vox","date":"20230927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaQUhAOdtk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yeaQUhAOdtk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":613139}}
