{"description":"We are ever so close to another season of NFL Football. One that I only hope isn't as bonkers as last year's campaign was (for the sake of Sportsball. I'd rather not have vids creep to forty minutes, thank you).\n\nHowever, there is much to go over. Endless moving and shaking in an effort to upend the balance of power throughout the league. Quarterbacks on the move, key weapons securing both new homes and big paydays, and relentless bolstering in an effort to be declared the new kings of the NFL.\n\nThis video will go over all sixteen teams and what to expect out of each. the AFC is very tight, once again. There are arguments to be made for nearly every team to clinch a playoff spot, and it will be fascinating to see how things unfold moving forward.","title":"The Haters Guide to the 2022 NFL Season: AFC Edition","duration":969,"channel_id":"UC8a87KN4-w-ExcGufTeX9KQ","author":"UrinatingTree","date":"20220830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgpLaUQBuMg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dgpLaUQBuMg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":259367}}

{"description":"God of War Ragnar√∂k is set to conclude the Norse era of the series, a saga that‚Äôs seen Kratos atone for his troubling past by becoming a more conscientious god and (mildly) affectionate father. In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  \n\nI spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams and some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops. Moreover, you‚Äôll learn about Kratos‚Äô tools/toys, a never-before-seen dwarven realm that feels lived in, the unprecedented number of accessibility features available at launch, and some quality-of-life updates, including new navigation mechanics.\n\nOf course, that‚Äôs not all. We‚Äôve got other God of War content for your perusal, including a ranking of our five favorite bosses from the franchise. Additionally, Alex Van Aken attended Evo, favorably comparing the storied event to the Olympics. Marcus Stewart got hands-on time with the next entry in the most prominent fighting franchise of all time, Street Fighter 6. There are even a few fantastic freelance pieces ‚Äì one, for instance, documents the meticulous creation of a Cuphead boss fight. And if you‚Äôre wondering what big games are on the horizon, we‚Äôve got you covered with preview pages dedicated to Square Enix‚Äôs role-playing farming sim, Harvestella, Game Freak‚Äôs Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet, and so much more.  \n\n// S U B S C R I B E\nDon't miss any of our video features or exclusive coverage!\nSubscribe to the channel: https://www.YouTube.com/GameInformer?sub_confirmation=1\n\n// FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL\nTwitter | https://www.twitter.com/GameInformer\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/GameInformerMagazine\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/officialgameinformer/\n\n// READ GAME INFORMER MAGAZINE\n1 Year Digital Subscription for $14.98: https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/\n1 Year Physical Subscription for $14.98: https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/\n\n// M E R C H\nShow off your love for Game Informer ‚Äì Stickers, phone cases, mugs, and t-shirts: https://www.gameinformer.com/merch\n\n#godofwar #ps5 #godofwarragnarok","title":"God Of War Ragnar√∂k | Exclusive Cover Reveal Trailer","duration":76,"channel_id":"UCK-65DO2oOxxMwphl2tYtcw","author":"Game Informer","date":"20220830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z98hLrPowUQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z98hLrPowUQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":368391}}

Get ready to start a new fair Dinkum life and build a home on an Island inspired by the wild Australian outback. Explore tropical eucalyptus forests, survive scorching deserts, relax at cool billabongs and discover scrubland filled with adorable Aussie inspired wildlife. Collect valuable resources by hunting, mining, fishing and foraging to expand and customise your town and attract new townsfolk and businesses. Share your new home with friends and protect each other as you explore beautiful landscapes filled with dangerous predators.\n\nGo from starting out sleeping in a swag under the stars, to a sprawling town with farms, businesses and attractions. Eventually, you‚Äôll draw in visitors, who might decide to stay and make it their home too.\n\nKeep your neighbours happy by customising your town with fences, flower beds, street lamps, beehives, windmills, hedges, fountains and more. The happier your townsfolk are the more likely they are to settle down, bring their families and set up stores with unique items.\n\nInvite your friends to visit your town where they can help you construct buildings, shop at your stores, go fishing, race Emus, fight crocodiles much more!\n\nThe island is Choc-A-Bloc with insects, fish and minerals. So grab your thongs and go track down and collect them all for your personal museum collection, or sell them for a tidy profit!\n\nCare for and breed chickens, cows and sheep as well as Dinkum‚Äôs iconic Giant Wombats! The Wombats might seem intimidating at first, but really they are sweethearts.\n\nCultivate crops for your town across the whole island, choosing the best spots for each type. Not only do the seasons change, but the temperature shifts depending on where you are on the island\n\nHunt animals for food and defend yourself from deadly predators who are just as hungry as you. Those Roos might seem friendly but they pack a punch!\n\nAttack creatures head on or capture them with traps, it‚Äôs up to you how to survive.\n\nCustomise your character in Dinkum to be the True Blue version of you. Buy that shiny pair of sunnies or wide Akubra hat in the shop, or seek out rare items through exploring the great outdoors and through chinwags with fellow townsfolk.\n\nMake your house your own cosy abode. Craft a huge range of furniture and decorations, choose where everything goes and invite friends over to show off your interior designer creds.","title":"I Found Paradise and Ruined It for Everyone","duration":1163,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220828","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDmsYbJCwng","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hDmsYbJCwng/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3415011}}

{"description":"NASA‚Äôs Space Launch System, which the space agency hopes will take American astronauts back to the moon, has been in development for more than a decade. But today will be the first time NASA attempts to launch the multibillion-dollar rocket, the most powerful NASA has ever built.\nThe development of the SLS has been controversial. Several inspector general reports have dinged the project for being over budget and criticized NASA for paying performance bonuses to the prime contractor, Boeing, even though the project is years behind schedule.\nBut despite those setbacks, Congress has continued to fund the program, which has cost $23 billion and counting ‚Äî far more expensive than the rockets now being used by commercial space companies such as SpaceX. Critics often refer to the SLS as the ‚ÄúSenate Launch System.‚Äù\nWeather or technical issues could force NASA to delay the launch to another day, but when the SLS flies, the space agency says it will mark a major milestone in its ambitious Artemis program to create a sustainable presence on and around the moon.

That's the legendary player finally making his Baseball Bits debut. The Greg Maddux 76 pitch complete game (or was it the 77 pitch complete game) is somewhat of a legend. It's up to me to separate fact from fiction. Along the way, we make note of how some of Maddux's best features have been exaggerated over the years since his retirement, particularly his Greg Maddux velocity and Greg Maddux strikeouts. We'll also debunk the Greg Maddux 3-0 count stat. \n\nJust be to clear, I love and appreciate all things Greg Maddux. It might seem like I'm being a stickler here, but it's all in the name of accurately describing his legacy. That includes an accurate pitch count from the Greg Maddux July 22 1997 vs Cubs game, as well as heaps of praise for his Greg Maddux defense, value be darned. \n\nA lot of the video is focused on the Greg Maddux Braves years, but I tried to sneak in clips from his tenures with his other clubs as well. The Cubs in particular had Maddux for nearly as long as the Braves, even if Atlanta ultimately had him for his absolute peak. \n\n___________________________________________________\n\nFull game broadcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilahmEByorM\nBox Score: https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN199707221.shtml\nJ.J Cooper on fastball velocity: https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/the-measure-of-a-fastball-has-changed-over-the-years/\n\nSoundtrack from Maxo: \nhttps://soundcloud.com/maxoelectronic\nhttps://maxoisnuts.bandcamp.com/","title":"Greg Maddux‚Äôs 76-pitch complete game is FAKE | Baseball Bits","duration":980,"channel_id":"UCbW12JIVAdi5NugdakbU33A","author":"Foolish Baseball","date":"20220828","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHKo7f99kZE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/WHKo7f99kZE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":436034}}

By eliminating structural components typically found on conventional aircraft, such as engine nacelles, fuselage and tail, parasitic drag would be reduced down to its absolute minimum. The result would be a high-lift, low-drag aircraft with unequaled speed, range and efficiency. \n\nDespite earlier efforts around the world to develop all-wing aircraft designs, arguably no single person was more committed to the concept than pioneering American aircraft designer Jack Northrop. Beginning in the 1920‚Äôs Northrop studied the concept, drawing up countless designs for flying wing aircraft. By 1940, he had successfully produced two prototypes, the Model 1 (‚ÄúX216H‚Äù) in 1929 and the Northrop N-1M in 1940. But Northrop‚Äôs ambitions went far beyond just experimental planes.\n\nResponding to an urgent need for the United States to develop the first ever intercontinental bomber, in 1941 Northrop presented the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) with a concept for an enormous flying wing bomber that would offer unparalleled speed, range and efficiency. Not only would the aircraft far outperform conventional bombers, the all-wing design would make it structurally more simple and economical to build. Impressed with Northrop‚Äôs concept, the USAAF agreed to fund the aircraft‚Äôs development, ordering an experimental model designated as the XB-35 and pre-production models designated as YB-35s. The USAAF would eventually order over 200 production aircraft which were to be designated as B-35s. Later, a jet powered version, designated as the YB-49 would also be produced.\n\nBut engineering such unconventional aircraft would be a daunting engineering challenge for Northrop and his small team of engineers. Eliminating conventional control surfaces would maximize lift and minimize drag, but it would also create new unforeseen technical issues, many of which would only be discovered during flight testing - with tragic consequences. Despite best efforts by Northrop to solve technical issues with flying wing aircraft, solutions would prove elusive using technology available in the 1940s.\n\n \nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\n\nIntro Song:  ‚ÄúDark Frontier‚Äù- go.apmmusic.com/04x3\n\nSong 1: ‚ÄúNo Tomorrow‚Äù - go.apmmusic.com/ow4z\n\nSong 2: ‚ÄúDark Sun‚Äù - go.apmmusic.com/lqbd\n\nSong 3: ‚ÄúPulsating Tension‚Äù- go.apmmusic.com/c64q\n\nSong 4:  ‚ÄúDocumentaries‚Äù- https://audiojungle.net/item/documentaries/29566240\n\nSong 6:  ‚ÄúIntensity‚Äù - go.apmmusic.com/snrq\n\nOutro Song:  ‚ÄúDark Frontier‚Äù- go.apmmusic.com/04x3\n\nThanks for watching!","title":"What Happened To Flying Wings?","duration":811,"channel_id":"UC1ZBQ-F-yktYD4m5AzM6pww","author":"Mustard","date":"20220827","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dByvPIyIbZE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dByvPIyIbZE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1339533}}
