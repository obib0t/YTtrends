productora: Worldjunkies Inc\nCo Producción: 1868 Studios\nExecutive Producers: Erick Douat & Alejandro Jimenez\nDir Arte: Jose Ignacio Jimenez\n5020 Records\n\nHe gastao mucho dinero en pañales y teteros\nPorque en este género tengo más hijos que el lechero\nCuando se meten con el mero mero\nSaco el bombardero y acelero\nY su nivel rebaja sin que tomen coca cola cero\nHago un agujero y entro cuando quiero\nPor debajo del portero\nEste caballero pateando como delantero\nLes parte el trasero \nSoy el lobo que revuelca el gallinero\nNi con balas de plata muero siempre nuevo\ncomo el primero de enero.\nLo mío nunca caduca\nYa yo no tiro punchlines\nYo disparo con bazooka\nMis barras botas mas humo que un salón de hookas\nCon media yuca les parto la nuca\nY como a Farruko se les vuela la peluca\nDesde mi niñez tengo lucidez\nNo creo en el 2, no creo en el 3\nCreo en el 1 y el 0, es\npor eso soy el 10.\nYo los muerdo,\nno pueden conmigo estos cerdos\nNi peleando solo con el ojo izquierdo\nNi aunque Drake apueste a favor mío pierdo.\nMe comí todos los entremeses\nEn esta pecera ya no veo peses \nSin que me interese\nComo cuando hablo y me como las eses\nMe dicen Cesar Millan a veces\nPorque cuando el Residente habla\nEstos perros obedecen\nSoy imparable ni aunque recen \nMil veces todos los meses\nSoy como Messi clavándose a los franceses\nPorque desde Calle 13\nEl rap y yo vivimos juntos como los siameses\nMi letra es precisa cuando va de prisa\nSoy como una brisa que los descuartiza\nCon el filo de mi tiza\nComo las navajas de suiza\nNi aunque me tiren encima las playas de Ibiza\nEste volcán se paraliza\nLos hago cenizas\nChito Vera dándole una paliza\nPero les juro que me cansa darles duro\nLo se, soy un inmaduro\nPa divertirme los torturo\nLes desfiguró los días del sol\nPara que su futuro sea oscuro\nYa no quiero hacer más tiraeras\nQuiero pasear mi perrito por la acera\nTener sexo grupal hasta que muera\nHacer manualidades pa vender en la primavera\nRegar las plantas del jardín con la manguera\nAbogar por la paz mundial en la tierra\nCada vez que haya guerra\nSiempre por el centro nunca a la extrema\nSin asumir posturas de ningún tema\nPorque no quiero problemas.\nCaerle bien a to el mundo como un pastel de crema\nQuiero ser humanista\nQuiero dejar de acribillar artistas\nY que las cabezas ya no rueden por la pista\nPronunciar las “eses” en todas las entrevistas\nDesde hoy, quiero ser baladista.\n\nSoy el amor que te ama, AMÁNDOTE.\nQuiero querer, quererte, QUERIÉNDOTE.\nY si yo estoy aquí y tu estás allá,\nquiero que vengas aquí y salgas de allá.\nTe falta lo que tengo aquí, me falta lo que tienes allá.\nY si no puedes llegar aquí pues cierra los ojos allá. \nImagínate que estás aquí conmigo.\n\nDesde chiquito admito que cuando me agito y recito\npor el beat hasta el infinito ya no veo letras en mi manuscrito,\nahora solo veo numeritos.\nSoy calculador como asesino en serie\ncuando decapito cada cabeza de cada raperito\nla cuantifico.\nEstoy enfermo porque mientras más les doy me excito.\nHasta el planeta Tierra me pide a los gritos: “¡NOOOO\nMEJOR QUE CAIGA UN METEORITO!”\nDicen que estoy maldito porque sin varita mágica y sin sombrerito\nyo los convierto en pajaritos.\nSolo recito mis escritos y vuelan pal carajo\ncomo los celulares que tira Benito.\nViven menos que un mosquito,\nsus películas no duran porque yo se las edito.\nMe dicen Almodovar sin tener un guión escrito\nporque yo no vivo para el Rap, el Rap vive en la piel que habito.\nPerdonan que presuma pero saben que el Residente\nes peligroso con la pluma, cinta negra con la tinta\ncolor puma, como Snoop Dog se los fuma.\n¡Ni pidiendo por la paz mundial, los salva Maluma!\nEstoy entre la bruma jangueando con Moctezuma,\nno me llegan aunque sean contables no les da la suma.\nEstoy tirando tanta peste, que ni con un baño de espuma\nesta pista se perfuma.\nVoy de cacería con mi artillería\nmontada en las caballerías de letras en coreografía\ncon una maestría en poesía con ingeniería.\nMe ven las arpías pasar con mi palabrería y\n“Shhhh..se quedan en silencio como en una librería”\nEstas porquerías se duermen en la portería\naunque sea de día por eso con mucha alegría\npaso por la vía y ¡GOL DE DI MARIA!\nNi la sicología entendería\ncomo tengo tanta energía en un beat sin batería.\nY tantas preguntas que de fijo,\nSoy como si Sócrates y Platón tuvieran un hijo.\nCon la crisis de los cuarenta no soy el mismo,\nSiento que tengo otra persona dentro de mi organismo.\n\nSoy el amor que te ama, AMÁNDOTE.\nQuiero querer, quererte, QUERIÉNDOTE.\nY si yo estoy aquí y tu estás allá,\nquiero que vengas aquí y salgas de allá.\nTe falta lo que tengo aquí, me falta lo que tienes allá.\nY si no puedes llegar aquí pues cierra los ojos allá.\nImagínate que estás aquí conmigo..\n\n#Residente #RickyMartin #QuieroSerBaladista","title":"Residente, Ricky Martin - Quiero Ser

Recently, the concept of a Barbenheimer double feature emerge, and what seemed like just an internet meme translated into actual, real-world, box office dollars. Take that, Morbius!\n\nBarbenheimer definitely raises some questions. Like how did this insane pairing of films come to be? What do these movies have in common? Why is every single word in Oppenheimer underscored with epic music?

{"description":"The Exorcist: Believer\nOctober 2023\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.   \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar® nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own.  \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia Marcum), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil.  \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar® winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before. \n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid’s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela’s neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela’s friend.  \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award® nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.   \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty.  \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment.  \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Yücer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures.  \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever","title":"The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer","duration":183,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230725","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PIxpPMyGcpU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":13061155}}

The ending of the series is now upon us and throughout this video we're gonna be pointing out the easter eggs, comic book call backs and also giving our thoughts on the series as a whole. There's some good and bad things that the seasons done and I wanna give our thoughts on the whole thing.\n\nNow last week was a pretty slow burn with us getting a couple of different plot threads setting up things for this entry. Gi'ah and Varra threw a funeral for Talos and he somehwat got his wish in the end. He wanted to show the president that Skrulls weren't a threat which he accomplished judging off the news reports.\n\nAnyway Gi'ah and Varras part of the entry closed out with them having a shootout with Graviks forces. As for Gravik, he killed Pagon for being a Pagon and we learned his true plan. Alongside wanting to start world War 3 he was also trying to get something known as the harvest. Turned out Nick had collected the Avengers DNA and if I ever get super powers I'm completely f**ked. I wouldnt wish having to collect it on Gravik but yeah...entire room...full of it.\n\nWhat\n\nGoing back to Avengers Endgame it kinda recontextualises Nick Fury's appearance and while he was at the funeral he probably had his agents out in the field picking up the sample.","title":"SECRET INVASION Episode 6 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review, Easter Eggs, Theories And More","duration":1620,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230726","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfMHx8xOHvg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KfMHx8xOHvg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":354236}}

{"description":"This is the Season 2 teaser trailer for Invincible. New episodes coming November 3!!! Based on the groundbreaking comic book by Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker, and Ryan Ottley, the story revolves around 18-year-old Mark Grayson, who’s just like every other guy his age—except his father is (or was) the most powerful superhero on the planet. Still reeling from Nolan’s betrayal in Season 1, Mark struggles to rebuild his life as he faces a host of new threats, all while battling his greatest fear - that he might become his father without even knowing it. Starring Steven Yeun, with Sandra Oh, Zazie Beetz, Grey DeLisle, Chris Diamantopoulos, Walton Goggins, Gillian Jacobs, Jason Mantzoukas, Ross Marquand, Khary Payton, Zachary Quinto, Andrew Rannells, Kevin Michael Richardson, Seth Rogen, and J.K. Simmons. Joining the Season 2 cast are Sterling K. Brown, Peter Cullen, Rob Delaney, Calista Flockhart, Phil LaMarr, Luke MacFarlane, Tatiana Maslany, Scott McNairy, Jay Pharoah, Ella Purnell, Tim Robinson, Ben Schwartz, Rhea Seehorn, Lea Thompson, Paul F.
