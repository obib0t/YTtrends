{"description":"Welcome Back ladies and gents to the worst skyrim build ever created! It is perfectly balanced because today we have done todd howard proud by playing skyrim the true way Bethesda intended!  Say hello to the worst underpowered and overpowered character build the world has ever seen. Gone are the days of OP stealth archer Skyrim characters. Say hello to the new negative Armor rating heavy builds that can deal infinite damage upon taking damage but usually can only take 1 hit before they are defeated by a level 1 wolf. We have built perfectly balanced skyrim forks that 1 hit dragons and gods. Whilst building skyrim necromancy characters that can raise an army of the dead. But today we build a noodle that whilst having infinite health will still receive infinite damage. A Perfect Counter. So let us break skyrim together! And provided this video does well I think its time the spiffing brit takes on skyrim multiplayer! \n\nso it's time for me to flex my exploit skills and break the game with infinite armor. My power is unstoppable and I will defeat this impossible challenge with all of my skyrim illegal experience to discover if this game is broken or can you beat perfectly balanced gameplay! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced game series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n00:00 - RESTORATION ONLY\n00:30 - Welcome to Skyrim \n05:04 - The Farengar Exploit\n07:36 - The Horker Exploit\n07.39 - Hungry Hungry Horkers\n10:27 - Learning To Kill (Without Killing)\n13:30 - Exploiting Broken Loot\n15:30 - ENCHANTING ARMOUR IS BROKEN\n19:45 - Forging Best/Worst Items\n20:52 - TESTING OUR STRENGTH\n22:43 - Finding POISON\n26:10 - Behold - The Donut Ring\n29:46 - Getting the Dragon Tablet \n31:01 - Defeating Scourge Lord\n33:18 - Fighting the Dragon\n35:25 - (Finally) Beating the Dragon\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: The Worst Skyrim Build.\n\n#skyrim #build #worst","title":"The Worst Skyrim Build.","duration":2281,"channel_id":"UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ","author":"The Spiffing Brit","date":"20220808","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM7zd24AH7Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aM7zd24AH7Q/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1042129}}

{"description":"Mac Jones is entering his second season in the NFL, after making the playoffs his rookie year. However, his growth may be at question. According to New England Patriots beat writer Mike Giraldi, the QB is 'struggling' more than last summer with changes to the team's offensive staff. Colin Cowherd explains why he is concerned for Jones, along with how Bill Belichick will continue to struggle in his second season without Tom Brady. Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa and New York Giants QB Daniel Jones are entering their first seasons under new head coaches.

With some research and a quick decision, they fell upon the double-decker bus they had renovated to suit their family and full-time travel.\n\nThis rig has two bathrooms with a separate indoor and outdoor shower! The kitchen has a farmhouse style with a deep sink, induction stove, and plenty of gear for outdoor cooking. The rooftop deck has a sturdy railing so the entire family can enjoy the views, including hammocks that can hang from the safety guards! The kids dominate a daytime play area that turns into the parents sleeping quarters at night. This crew is family-oriented and travel driven.

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe‚Äôve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we‚Äôre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Feeling Untethered \n02:13 Start the South Island Road Trip\n03:26 Flea Bay - Banks Peninsula\n04:26 NZ Fur Seal Encounter\n06:39 Surfshark.deals/WYNNS\n07:58 Akaroa Head - Banks Peninsula\n11:37 What's Next - Our Loose Travel Plan\n13:25 New Catamaran Update - WHEN & WHERE\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n¬© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"WE‚ÄôRE IN A WEIRD PLACE (+boat update & what's next)","duration":928,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220807","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YrJVpTtY6g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4YrJVpTtY6g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":205130}}

{"description":"Amy Rose thought her transformation was going to be the catalyst for a whirlwind romance with Sonic the Hedgehog. But, she let her Sonic mania get the better of her, which resulted in a Sonic vs Amy showdown. So, it doesn‚Äôt look like Sonic and Amy will ever be a thing now. In lieu of the opportunity to now call herself Mrs. Sonic Hedgehog, Amy is turning to the one person she knows will help her in her time of need: Miles Tails Prower.\n\nAfter making Sonic boom, Tails is well aware that Amy needs some guidance‚Ä¶ and a shovel. After all, what are friends for? So, off to the woods they go to try and salvage this Sonic exe situation. But, it‚Äôs here where Amy learns of the truth about this Sonic origins story. Or, truthfully, this Tails origin story. To the two-tailed fox, this has just been one big Sonic game.

{"description":"A day in the life of a Japanese Knife maker working in knife factory in Seki City Japan.  This is what a typical work day would be for a knife technician in the factory and outside of workplace.  The Japanese work culture can be seen in her everyday activities.  Also, this is how Japanese knives are made. Nene works as a knife technician at Zwilling J.A. Henckels Japan, originally a 291-year-old German Knife maker who eventually setup an office in Japan and later acquired their knife factory here in Seki city, also known in Japan as the city of blades, crafting flawless samurai swords and knives for more than 800 years and producing half of Japan‚Äôs total knives in this city alone.  Today, 90% of the company‚Äôs knives sold in Japan are actually made here at this factory.  Throughout her shift, she‚Äôs tasked with inspecting knives being crafted that day, to ensure that each knife meets the factory‚Äôs strict quality standards. Which also means that she‚Äôs responsible for knowing the details about each and every knife that‚Äôs crafted in the factory including the entire build process for that individual knife and the technical requirements each one must satisfy in order for her to fully perform the inspections. In fact, all the workers are required to undergo basic training when joining, and during the training period, each worker‚Äôs skills are assessed and based on their strengths, assigned a specific role such as sharpening knifes, welding, etc.  Apparently, sharpening the knives by hand is one of the most challenging parts when crafting a knife.  So much so, the factory itself only has 9 specialists who have mastered the skill, and at the moment only 2 who are skilled enough to perform Kiwami Honbazuke, the most extreme and technical knife sharpening possible.\n\nZwilling J.A.

I first built the frame which was made of two tripods set close together. They were of wood and lashed together with cane. Then I made a basket from cane to hold the large rocks that would act as the counterweight. For the sling I used bark fiber from dead branches of a certain type of tree. The bark was stripped and the inner bark woven into rope. The rope was then made into a sling using 2 knots and thinner rope was used to weave the sling pouch. A simple toggle release was used hold the throwing arm in position and act as the trigger. The counter weight was then filled with rocks and pulled into position to be held by the toggle. A shot-put sized stone was then placed into the sling pouch. When the toggle was released the stone would be launched 18- 20 meters (the length of the clearing) but could undoubtedly shoot further if more weight was added. Targets were set up and destroyed. Range can be adjusted by adding or subtracting weight from the basket, while shooting to the left or right is done by turning the whole catapult while the basket is empty. The whole build took 5 weeks, the hardest part being collecting the bark fiber to make the rope. The trebuchet is a simple but effective way to deliver payloads to a target destination.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
