{"description":"In August 2023, it took about twice as long to sell an EV in the U.S. as it did the previous January. Prices of EVs are down 22% year-over-year and that's mainly driven by Tesla. About two thirds of EVs sold are Elon Musk's brand. Companies like Ford have ramped up hybrid production as demand has leveled off. While slightly more than half of consumers say EVs are the future and will eventually replace Internal Combustion Engines, less than a third of dealers say so. This all comes at a time when investments in EVs are more than ever. So what's really going on?

{"description":"Watch the official trailer for #AmericanFiction, starring Jeffrey Wright, Tracee Ellis Ross, Issa Rae, and Sterling K. Brown. From Writer/Director Cord Jefferson. Only in theaters this December.\n\n AMERICAN FICTION is Cord Jefferson's hilarious directorial debut, which confronts our culture’s obsession with reducing people to outrageous stereotypes. Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.\n\nAbout MGM Studios: Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) is a leading entertainment company focused on the production and global distribution of film and television content across all platforms. The company owns one of the world’s deepest libraries of premium film and television content as well as the premium pay television network MGM+, which is available throughout the U.S. via cable, satellite, telco and digital distributors.

{"description":"Long queues formed outside bakeries in Khan Younis, Gaza Saturday, as the Palestinian enclave suffered power cuts and dwindling food supplies after a week of retaliatory airstrikes and a full Israeli blockade. \n\nIsrael’s military has announced a roughly six-hour window for Palestinians to continue fleeing south along specified routes inside of Gaza, as thousands vacate their homes following evacuation orders ahead of a possible Israel Defense Forces ground assault. \n\n“Follow our instructions — move south of Wadi Gaza,” said IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht during a Saturday news briefing, suggesting residents who remain north of that geographic location may be faced with a possible Israeli offensive. \n\nIDF officials also told the residents in northern regions they could continue to travel south on the territory’s main highways Saturday “without any harm” until 4 p.m. \n\nThe Israel Defense Forces confirmed early Friday that it had notified residents in Gaza City to leave for \"their own safety and protection\" after it vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters stormed through towns and villages in southern Israel last week, killing 1,300 Israelis, mainly civilians, and making off with scores of hostages. \n\n\"You will be able to return to Gaza City only when another announcement permitting it is made,\" IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said in a live-streamed briefing on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. \n\nhttps://www.voanews.com/a/gazans-scramble-as-clock-ticks-down-on-israeli-evacuation-orders/7310676.html  \n\n» Subscribe to VOA News: https://bit.ly/3KIPysi\n» Watch more VOA News video: https://www.youtube.com/c/VOANews\n\nVoice of America (VOA) is the largest U.S. international broadcaster, providing news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of 236.8 million people.

Clone Riggy is a character created by Danno Cal Drawings / Danno Draws, and was featured in the Shorts Wars. Clone Riggy is based of Riggy the Rabbit Monkey or Riggy the Runkey. \n\nI was super happy to see that so many people enjoyed the earlier Riggy vs Sans animation! The fight in this animation took tons of work, and I really put my heart and soul into making this video! \n\nFor the music, since Riggy's theme is basically Attack of the Killer Queen, I wanted Clone Riggy's battle to have the song \"Chaos King\" because it is like an evil opposite version of the Queen 😆\n\n I hope you enjoy this Clone Riggy and Sans animation!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow me here!\n\n📷INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/CyberLegendsAnimations/\n🐦 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CyberLegendsYT\n📧 BUSINESS EMAIL: cyberlegendsbiz@gmail.com\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER ⚠️\nDo not reupload my animations on any platform.\nReaction videos are allowed, as long as credit is given to my video link, and my channel link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits:\nRiggy The Rabbit Monkey & Clone Riggy by @DannoDraws \n\n\"Chaos King - Deltarune (Arrangement)\"\n\"Chaos King – DELTARUNE Chapter 1 | Arrangement (2023)\"\nBy @risty9203  https://www.youtube.com/@risty9203\n\n\"Break-A-Leg\", \nA Bed of Snakes - \"17092017\"\n\"Fkaboing\"\nA Bed of Snakes - 03 J'azz Blue\nThese songs are licensed under: Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\nBy RoccoW \n\nSplashing Around By The Green Orbs\n\nWe Must Battle NOW\nBy Cody O’Quinn https://www.youtube.com/@CodyOQuinn\n\nDemise\nBy PeriTune (https://peritune.com)\n\n\"Silly Duck\", \"Bowser- Returns\", \"Bitter Fight\" \"Dank Memes\" \"Mew Mew\" \"Mr Snarky Destructoid\" By Tim Beek (timbeek.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nOutro Song: Undertale ▸ His Theme ▸ Sprightly Remix\nBy: Gamechops: https://www.youtube.com/c/gamechops\nSprightly: https://www.youtube.com/@Sprightlygames\nVideo Link: https://youtu.be/H3exBli7QfU\n\nSound effects from: https://www.zapsplat.com/\nSound effects from: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com\nSound effects from: https://pixabay.com/\nSound effects from YouFulca: https://wingless-seraph.net/\n\n#raiseriggy #riggy #sans #dannodraws #riggytherabbitmonkey #cloneriggy #riggyvscloneriggy #undertale #shorts #shortswars #dannocaldrawings #sansau #undertaleau #animation\n\n\n== SANS vs AMANDA THE ADVENTURER == \n\nASSURED PREY V2 (My take)\nBy Positive Max\nOrignal by FRANDERMAN123\n\nRoccoW - Weeklybeats 2014 #1 - KORG M01D Jam\nWeeklybeats 2014 #1 - KORG M01D Jam by RoccoW is licensed under a Attribution-ShareAlike License.\n\nSwing House - RKVC\n\n\"The Show Must Be Go\", \"Quirky Dog”, \"Black Vortex”, \"Android Sock Hop”, \"Le Grand Chase”, \"DarxieLand”, \"Unseen Horrors”, \"Local Forecast - Elevator\" by Kevin MacLeod  (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\nXenogenesis by TheFatRat\n\n\n\n== SANS vs GARTEN OF BANBAN 4 == \n\nLethal Deal V2 (Cover)\nBy Positive Max\n\n\"Quirky Dog\", \"Cruising for Goblins\", \"Circus of Freaks\", \"The Show Must Be Go\", Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\"Demise\", \"BattleField 5\", \"Raid 3\", \"Raid\", By PeriTune (https://peritune.com)\n\nHARDERLOVANIA Remix\nBy RAMI_AWFUL https://www.youtube.com/@rami_awful\n\nReality Check Through The Skull\nBy DM DOKURO https://www.youtube.com/@DMDOKURO\n\nDogsong but it's Megalovania https://youtu.be/C5Vyc-MG7IQ\nBy Midi Slapper https://www.youtube.com/@MIDISLAPPER\n\nSplashing Around \nBy The Green Orbs\n\n== If SANS Was in RAINBOW FRIENDS ==\n\nCREDITS:\n\nSong Remixes:\nDark Darker Yet Darker , Alphys, Checker Dance, Knock You Down !!, Vs Lancer, Sans.\nBy Vetrom\n\n\n\n== BLOOM N BRAINZ - PEASHOOTER SANS ===\n\nOriginal Song by: Jason The Art Kid \nSans Soundfont by Draco\nMidi by: SKEEECH's Midi Library\n\n\n\n== The LOST SILVER and KILLER SANS Show!

When I left school, I fell into a wonderful job at a local small engine shop where I worked the counter for a couple years. In 2010 my husband and I opened up our own small engine shop in central Arkansas where I am able to work alongside my family and best friends. We see over 2,000 pieces of small engine equipment every year, and answer 1,000's of small engine questions. We specialize in brands such as Briggs and Stratton, Kohler, Echo and Shindaiwa, but work everyday on MANY other brands like Stihl, Husqvarna, Honda, Craftsman, Remington, Red Max, Troy Bilt, Scag, Bad Boy, Hustler, World Lawn, Poulan, Mantis, Etc..

{"description":"Up in the sky, that's a rocket arcing over the sky in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. And see that explosion? That's the iron dome missile defense system in action.. Intercepting and eliminating the projectile.\n\nIt might seem like not much more than a blip in the sky, but take a look at the view at night. Each of those explosions is right here. A thwarted rocket attack.\n\nThe Israeli company that developed the iron dome system says the system has destroyed thousands of unguided rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon into Israel since 2011.\n\nBut the iron dome isn't really a dome. Though it's meant to create a force field effect. They're movable batteries, attached to missile launchers that look like this.\n\nAnd here's how it works - so first, its radar senses a rocket when it's getting close. Anywhere from 2.5 to 43 miles away. According to Raytheon - a U.S. defense contractor that helps produce them. Then, the iron dome's control center kicks into gear - and quickly analyzes whether a rocket will hit populated areas. If it determines the rocket will hit a town or a city, the system will tell a launcher to shoot off a missile that will intercept and destroy it mid-air. The fragments of metal and debris then fall to the ground.\n\nThe Israeli defense forces reported that it intercepted more than 95 percent of rockets during an operation last May. Over the last few days, the Israeli military says 4,500 rockets were fired from Gaza, and the Iron Dome has intercepted many.\n\n===================\n\nWCNC Charlotte considers multiple perspectives and provides diverse points of view.

The film also stars Natasha Rothwell (“White Lotus,” “Insecure”), Rich Fulcher (“Marriage Story,” “Disenchantment”), Rakhee Thakrar (“Sex Education,” “Four Weddings and a Funeral”), Tom Davis (“Paddington 2,” “King Gary”) and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith (“Paddington 2,” “Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Mary Poppins Returns”). \n\nSimon Farnaby (“Paddington 2”) & Paul King wrote the screenplay, based on a story by King and characters created by Roald Dahl.  Michael Siegel, Cate Adams, Rosie Alison and Tim Wellspring are serving as executive producers.  King’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Chung-Hoon Chung (“Last Night in Soho,” “Ah-ga-ssi”); Oscar-nominated production designer Nathan Crowley (“Tenet,” “Dunkirk”); editor Mark Everson (the “Paddington” films); Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (the “Paddington” films, “Topsy-Turvy”); and composer Joby Talbot (the “Sing” films).

And I've learned even more about the game since the last one.  But more then that, the game has improved a ton, too!   In this Cities Skylines 2 gameplay video, we'll continue to build Moundsville, which  is a city inspired by a real master plan; however, in this episode, Moundsville completely outgrows its plans as we add a ton of density.\n\nBut beyond just adding density, we'll also build some of the grittier parts of the city, including cargo rail and passenger rail infrastructure, a garbage incineration plant, a new solar power plant and battery backup, all of the specialized industries, and MASSIVE suburban expansions.  By the end, we'll add a ton of skyscrapers to the city.  \n\nStick around until after the tour when I'll give you my completely unvarnished views on the game.\n\nFYI - this is not a sponsored video, but I want to give a huge shout out to  @paradoxinteractive  and the  @CitiesSkylines  team for providing me early access to the game!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS VIDEOS IN SERIES\n\n►  First CS2 video: https://youtu.be/xm2yD9mXgPQ\n► Seconds CS2 video: https://youtu.be/g9yESIzeyQ0\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFIND ME HERE\n\n► Website: http://CityPlannerPlays.com \n► Discord:  https://discord.gg/CityPlannerPlays\n► Twitter:  https://twitter.com/cityplanneryt\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE CHANNEL, GET COOL PERKS!\n\n► Merch Store:  https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Store\n► Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CityPlannerPlays\n► YT Membership: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/YTMembership\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMY MUSIC\n\n► Master Planned Music: Http://MasterPlannedMusic.com\n► Epidemic Sound: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Epidemic\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMY GEAR\n\n► Kit.co Link  https://kit.co/cityplannerplays\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLAYLISTS\n\n► Ultimate Beginners Guide: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/BeginnersGuide\n► Cities Skylines II: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/CS2\n► Tutorials: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Tutorials\n► Nicolet Bay: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/NicoletBay\n► Verde Beach: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/VerdeBeach\n► Clearwater County: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/ClearwaterCounty\n► Abandoned City Fix: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/AbandonedCity\n► Sustainable City: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/SustainableCity\n► Bluffside Crossing: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Bluffside\n► City Tips: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/CityTips\n► Previous Live Streams: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Streams\n► Timberborn: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/Timberborn\n► Other Games: https://link.cityplannerplays.com/OtherGames\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHASHTAGS\n\n#CitiesSkylines2 #cityplannerplays\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHAPTERS\n\nSeries Recap and Off Camera Fixes! - 0:00\nI'm the Trash Man! - 2:37\nALL of the Rail - 6:04\nThe Suburbs - 17:46\nSolar - 32:01\nSpecialized Industry - 37:04\nIncreasing Density - 46:34\nCity Tour - 53:52\nHow I feel about the game after 143 hours - 55:30","title":"After 143 hours playing Cities Skylines 2, I built THIS city and have a few thoughts...","duration":3598,"channel_id":"UC8WAaaW2FnctRI9coYJoUdA","author":"City Planner Plays","date":"20231011","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P21vSG4Adwc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P21vSG4Adwc/hqdefault.jpg?v=65265560","content":{"View count":556784}}

{"description":"The 2024 Lamborghini Revuelto is the company’s first high-performance hybrid supercar. Powered by a roaring V12 with an absurdly high 9500 rpm redline and three electric motors, the Revuelto makes over 1000 horsepower combined. All of this explosive and electric power is connected by a transversal dual clutch e-gearbox, which aids in achieving Lamborghini’s claimed 0-100 kmh time of just 2.5 seconds. But performance aside, does a hybrid Lamborghini still feel like a Lamborghini? And how is it on the track? Thomas is off to Italy to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.
