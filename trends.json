Renowned since their inception for electrifying performances, The Rose quickly became one of Korea's most sought-after groups delivering a series of critically acclaimed albums that resonated with fans worldwide. In 2019, three of the band members temporarily went on hiatus to fulfill their mandatory military service obligations, during which WOOSUNG pursued a successful solo career, releasing captivating albums and embarking on sold-out world tours.\n\nIn a moment of sheer joy for their devoted fans, The Rose reunited during one of Woosung's performances in South Korea in 2022. This reunion paved the way for their first full-length album HEAL, which was inspired by the transformative power of music and the stories shared by both their fans and themselves. HEAL soared to #4 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, while their accompanying HEAL Together World Tour drew an overwhelming crowd of over 90,000 attendees.\n\nNow, with their highly anticipated second full-length album DUAL, The Rose takes their music to new heights. Building upon the emotional honesty and vulnerability showcased in HEAL, this latest offering explores the profound concept of 'balance.' Seamlessly merging light and dark elements, The Rose masterfully weaves emotions and sounds, capturing the dualistic essence that defines their music. \n\nDriven by unwavering dedication to their fans and the unbreakable bond of their friendship, The Rose continues to push artistic boundaries, captivating audiences worldwide with their soul-stirring music and unforgettable performances.\n\nÎçî Î°úÏ¶à(The Rose)Îäî ÎåÄÌïúÎØºÍµ≠ Ïù∏Îîî Î°ù Î∞¥ÎìúÏù¥Îã§.

How did the US go from having luxurious, widely used passenger trains to the Amtrak system we have today? \n\nVideo producer Dean Peterson makes a 72-hour journey on Amtrak from LA to NYC to show its current state of operation. From getting kicked in the head by his sleeping seat mate to taking in sweeping views of the desert at sunset, Dean shows the highs and lows of being stuck on Amtrak for days on end. \n\nAlong the way, he explains the history of passenger rail in the US ‚Äî starting in the problematic robber baron era to the US government‚Äôs takeover of passenger rail. Will the United States ever catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to train travel, or are Americans stuck with an underfunded, inefficient rail network forever?

{"description":"Mike, Jay, and Rich Evans have returned again to the black void. Their reason today? To talk about a new huge summer blockbuster movie? No. Quite the opposite. They was gonna talk about Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 2: Dead Reckoning 1, BUT they thought‚Ä¶ how many times can one see Tom Cruise do stints? No, this day Mike, Jay, and Rich have returned to the black void to talk about ‚ÄúWatchbait‚Äù the movie version of ‚ÄúClickbait‚Äù. Trash that has overrun a once great institution like Tubi. And before you ask, no we wasn‚Äôt compensated by Tubi to promote these films. We were just browsing about and saw a trend. A trend of using certain words or phrases in a title to get one to click on their junk film to watch it, only to realize after a few minutes they made the worst mistake of their lives. This particular video wasn‚Äôt a Half in the Bag. Nor was it a re:View. Nor was it a Best of the Worst. I guess it could have been a ‚ÄúTalks About‚Äù video, but nah. We made a new show called ‚ÄúBeyond the Black Void‚Äù and if you ever see one of these again, it‚Äôs just Mike, Jay and Rich Evens talking about something of interest. In solidarity with the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strike we decided to talk about movies that in no way whatsoever could have possibly been made under any conceivable union agreement. In fact, I‚Äôd be shocked if one of these pictures weren‚Äôt some kind of nudie snuff film. Maybe that‚Äôs why Jay ‚Äúdownloaded all of them on his dark web server‚Äù whatever that means. And yes, it‚Äôs 100% true, we did just spring this whole thing on Rich Evans. I rang him up on my landline to tell him to come to the studio. Well, actually I left a message on his answering machine. He showed up coming from the gym where‚Äôs he‚Äôs done many power squats and asked me ‚ÄúWhat we shootin‚Äô Mike?‚Äù and I tell him to sit down and shut up you shit-for-brains. He sits down, but there is an immediate squish sound. It would appear that Rich had soiled his large diaper. He claimed he didn‚Äôt know. He insisted he ONLY wears a diaper when he does power squats at the gym. 1. it helps stifle the sound of any accidental fart release, but also for‚Ä¶ you know what. An accidental Hershey squirt. This is apparently what happened. Luckily a very large toddler had died outside our building and I was able to provide Rich Evans with replacement clothing. A lot went into this video. So please, enjoy.","title":"Beyond The Black Void - Watchbait","duration":1896,"channel_id":"UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA","author":"RedLetterMedia","date":"20230718","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeMadjM0ZZI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UeMadjM0ZZI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":609425}}

While dad Mack is content to keep his family safe paddling around their New England pond forever, mom Pam is eager to shake things up and show their kids‚Äîteen son Dax and duckling daughter Gwen‚Äîthe whole wide world. After a migrating duck family alights on their pond with thrilling tales of far-flung places, Pam persuades Mack to embark on a family trip, via New York City, to tropical Jamaica. \n\nAs the Mallards make their way South for the winter, their well-laid plans quickly go awry. The experience will inspire them to expand their horizons, open themselves up to new friends and accomplish more than they ever thought possible, while teaching them more about each other‚Äîand themselves‚Äîthan they ever imagined. \n\nFrom a screenplay by Mike White, the Emmy winning creator of The White Lotus and the screenwriter of School of Rock, the film stars a top-flight comedic cast led by Oscar¬Æ and Emmy nominee Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick, Eternals) as anxious Mallard dad Mack and Emmy nominee Elizabeth Banks (Hunger Games and Pitch Perfect franchises) as Pam, the Mallards‚Äô daring, quick-witted matriarch.\n\nCaspar Jennings plays Dax, the Mallards‚Äô confident and restless son, and, in her feature film debut, Tresi Gazal plays Gwen, the family‚Äôs innocent and lovable daughter.\n\nGolden Globe winner Awkwafina (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) voices the scrappy leader of a New York City pigeon gang; Emmy winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Carol Kane (The Princess Bride) plays Erin the heron, the first friend that the Mallards make on their journey; Emmy winner Keegan-Michael Key (The Super Mario Bros. Movie, The Lion King) voices a homesick Jamaican parrot locked away in a Manhattan restaurant, and BAFTA winner David Mitchell (Peep Show) plays the yogic leader of a mysterious duck farm. Legendary Emmy winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Danny DeVito (It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia) co-stars as Mack‚Äôs curmudgeonly, adventure-averse Uncle Dan. \n\nDirected by Benjamin Renner, the Oscar¬Æ-nominated filmmaker of Ernest & Celestine and The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales, Migration is a visual spectacle unlike any in Illumination‚Äôs acclaimed history, featuring elevated, expressionist artistry and Illumination‚Äôs signature subversive humor and authentic heart, unforgettable characters and joyful soundtrack. \n\nProduced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri, Migration is a film about overcoming your fears and opening yourself up to the world and its opportunities. The film is co-directed by Guylo Homsy (Head of Layout and Cinematography for Sing and Sing 2), edited by Christian Gazal (Happy Feet, Peter Rabbit) and the Production Designer is Colin Stimpson (The Secret Life of Pets 2).","title":"Migration | Official Trailer","duration":192,"channel_id":"UCq7OHvWO6Z3u-LztFdrcU-g","author":"Illumination","date":"20230718","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQfo0HJhCnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cQfo0HJhCnE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":7504485}}

Often described as \"a show about nothing,\" Seinfeld mines the humor in life's mundane situations like waiting in line, searching for a lost item, or the trials and tribulations of dating. Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry's ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry's neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry's eccentric neighbor, Kramer.\n\n#Seinfeld #LarryDavid #TheBeard\n\nGeorge's Toup√©e Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeld\nhttps://bit.ly/OfficialSeinfeld","title":"George's Toup√©e Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeld","duration":310,"channel_id":"UCKv01ZGOJhp2HbtDe4EvS8A","author":"Seinfeld","date":"20230717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVBbqvLtWBs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVBbqvLtWBs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":589574}}

If someone miraculously acquires all 5, they receive the Grand Prize. I don't know what the Grand Prize is, but I need it. This is why It's Impossible to Find this Item:\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VeVDgNgv8V\nPodcast: @testrunpodcast \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Tubbo / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy! \n\nThanks to Slatcho for the help editing: https://linktr.ee/slatcho?utm_source=linktree_admin_share\n\nIf anyone on School SMP is reading this: \n\nWe did it! High school went by so fast, and although I didn't really enjoy calculating velocity vectors or writing 5 paragraph essays with a \"works cited\", I would never take back a single moment that I had with you all. I've come to realize that friendship is one of the most valuable things in the world, and I can't thank you enough. You all supported me when YouTube was just a dream, and you never changed when that dream became a reality. But, you did so much more. You made me crack up when I was at my lowest points. You pushed me when I didn't feel like moving forward. You were all so true to yourself, and I appreciate you all so much for that. 7 years zipped by, but the memories we made together will stick with me forever. I was gonna submit a speech for graduation, but I'd much rather make a YouTube video XD. I'm gonna miss you guys, but I'll always have your back no matter what.

The arcades include highly detailed machines with realistic physics that are inspired by modern arcade machines. There are ticket redemption areas to exchange your counted tickets for all kinds of fun prizes. Larry's Arcade has an in-house animatronic band called Teddy and the Ticket Eaters that would love to play you some tunes while you enjoy the arcade. The most recent addition to Islandville island, UFO Arcade features modern space inspired arcade machines, Lazer Tag and an Indoor Go Kart Race Track. Make sure to watch out for the minions, they really love Teddy and his band and they also are pretty good at Lazer Tag. Run out of money? That's ok. You can work odd jobs around the island to get back on your feet. Got extra prizes? The island has a Pawn Shop that will buy your used prizes for cash so you can go blow it back at the arcade.\n\nThe Coin Game also features a full fledged Traveling Carnival with over 20 classic games, rides and machines to choose from. The carnival also brings new prizes to win, hoard or sell for cash at Barrys pawn shop. The rides are all interactive and are overpriced just like in real life... so you better be winning, working or begging Uncle Phil for more spending cash if you want to enjoy them. (Birthday mode is unlimited money for all you lazies out there that just want to live off of Uncle Phils wallet and have a good time. So dont worry he has you covered). But dont get comfy as Survivor Mode is still being developed. ;)\n\nYou can play The Coin Game anyway that you like. For the laid back players, you can just play the fun games and win tickets to exchange for silly prizes. You don't have to worry about anything but winning tickets. Unlimited money. No curfews. No rules.... just arcade freedom brought to you by your rich Uncle Phil.\n\nThe Coin Game includes all the fun activities of a real trip to the arcade. Including drinking soda all day, dodging sugar filled minions and living off of vending machine cheesy poofs. To earn a little extra money you can scavenge the dumpsters and trash cans or even deliver newspapers around the island for extra spending loot. Explore the island on the Islandville bus system or even your very own golf cart.\n\nThere is lots of highway traffic and tourist activity on the island all year round, so make sure to keep off the roads or you may get a little surprise. There is even a few areas planned for the future that are off limits for now and surrounded by construction fencing to keep you safe. The Islandville Transit bus is always running if you need to get around the island doing chores. To hail the bus, simply click the button in any bus stop and buy a bus pass. Each bus ride costs one pass ($1.50).\n\nWith over 40 different games and machines there is already plenty to do on the island. You can play The Coin Game with any mouse, keyboard or any Dual stick/pad controller. The game includes a easy to use key mapping system to support virtually any controller or peripheral. So you can play The Coin Game any way that you like.\n\nThe Coin Game is developed by a one man indie developer over the last 3 years with the wonderful support of his wife, family and 2 weiner dogs.","title":"I Turned This Entire Game Into a Glitchy Pain Paradise - The Coin Game","duration":1320,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20230715","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NxW3xSAqUg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6NxW3xSAqUg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1828848}}
