{"description":"Having lived in Boston their whole life and now balancing living in two places at once, Nick, Matt, and Chris aren't your run everyday siblings. Better known as the Sturniolo Triplets, these social media power houses spend most of their lives in front of the camera, making content for the millions of fans who have come to know and love them. But what happens when the cameras are off, and these three aren't coming up with the next piece of content? Well, on the Cut the Camera podcast, Nick, Matt, and Chris are going to give their fans the unfiltered, real-to-life experience of hanging out with them as they share who they are when no one is watching. There are stories and thoughts that don't fit into a TikTok video. There are subjects that are worth a deeper dive. Nick, Matt, and Chris are here to bring you along for the ride as they continue to shape and define who they are and what obstacles they need to overcome as they live a life in the public eye. From mental health, to ridiculous questions and theories along with special guests, this podcast is here to give you even more of what you already know and love from the Sturniolo Triplets. So, grab your beverage of choice, a bag of chips, and follow along as we Cut the Camera.\n\nCut The Camera Podcast\nCo-hosts: Nick Sturniolo, Matt Sturniolo and Chris Sturniolo\nPodcast produced by Z Star Studios \nRecording & Editing by Z Star Studios\nDistribution Partner | Studio 71\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Social with The Sturniolo Triplets\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@SturnioloTriplets\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sturniolo.triplets\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sturniolo.triplets\n\nFor Brand Partnerships with The Sturniolo Triplets please email: triplets@zstardigital.com","title":"Cut The Camera | Podcast Trailer","duration":136,"channel_id":"UCllieDKASOsUh_rTF58a04Q","author":"Cut The Camera Podcast (by the sturniolo triplets)","date":"20230619","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Crk0heiq5I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7Crk0heiq5I/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":203455}}

{"description":"Today, the entry point for going mountain biking just got a little bit lower. The Ozark Trail Ridge, a $398 bicycle sold at Walmart stores, actually seems like it would be worth owning‚Äîthat is if you‚Äôre okay with rebuilding it after you take it home.\n\nMy criticism of department store bikes was NEVER that they are cheap, it was always that they are ridiculous. Why does a $150 bicycle have 18 gears and rear suspension? Why not put that money towards better parts and serviceability? I‚Äôll tell you why. The simplest bike with the fewest features looks like a terrible deal to an inexperienced buyer.\n\nBut some of us are, in fact, looking for a simple and affordable bike that‚Äôs easy to service and possible to upgrade, and the Ozark Trail Ridge was clearly designed with that in mind. Today, I‚Äôm going to show you the Ridge and all the reasons it‚Äôs the best department store bike in its price range.\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-29-Ridge-Mountain-Bike-Medium-Frame-Gray/1656914661\n\nCOME JOIN US AT THE BACKCOUNTRY BASH!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1287497231850218/\n\nBerm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts\nhttps://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nWant us to review your unique mountain bike or outdoor product? https://www.sethsbikehacks.com/product-review/\n\nCheck out our main channel https://youtube.com/c/sethsbikehacks\nFollow me on Instagram https://instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nBerm Peak Merch https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nMusic in this video is from \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg\nand https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20\n\nJoin my Patreon and 100% of the proceeds go towards projects in the mountain biking community.

He is the President of a nonprofit organization called Laughing At My Nightmare, and a renowned public speaker who has performed across the country at places such as Harvard University, The University of Florida, The University of Connecticut, Princeton University, and many more.\n\nHannah Burcaw (she/her) graduated from Carleton College, where she studied Sociology and Anthropology. She films and edits the ‚ÄúSquirmy and Grubs‚Äù vlog, which has over 1,000,000 subscribers on YouTube. Hannah has spoken at prestigious universities and Fortune 500 companies alike about the realities of ableism. On her popular Instagram account, she advocates for acceptance of all people and works to improve the way society thinks about disability.\n\nShane and Hannah have been together for over four years. They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together.","title":"Egg Retrieval Time! - IVF Journey Part 3","duration":889,"channel_id":"UCdomP1JqhnyBQGaBmfDl4KQ","author":"Squirmy and Grubs","date":"20230619","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvzJp5dMsq0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JvzJp5dMsq0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":242613}}

{"description":"Croatia and Spain faced off in Rotterdam, Netherlands, for the UEFA Nations League Final. Possession was near-equal in the first half with Spain knocking off six shots total and Croatia with seven. Three of Croatia‚Äôs seven shots were on goal, however none were successful. Halftime arrived nil-nil. Croatia took control early in the second half with an extremely close opportunity at 51‚Äô. Spain would strike back-to-back at 84‚Äô and 85‚Äô in attempt to take the lead in regular time. Tension grew as both 15 minute halves of extra time passed, still nil-nil. After a nail-biter round of penalty kicks, Dani Carvajal scored the 5-4 finisher and Spain was crowned victorious in the UEFA Nations League Final.\n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #Spain\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n‚ñ∫PBC ON FOX‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n‚ñ∫WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n‚ñ∫NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n‚ñ∫CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer‚Äôs YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

And they were QUICKER than Ferrari, Aston Martin and Porsche!\n\nIt‚Äôs a Next-Gen Camaro that has been adapted to work at Le Mans. But if you missed it, you might be a bit confused about how this came about. \n\nNASCAR has changed a lot recently, with newer, more aerodynamic cars.\nCentre-lock wheels rather than the zzz,zzz,zzz,zzz,zzz lug nuts they used to run. \nThey‚Äôve even moved to more F1-looking tyres rather than the old-style, tall-sidewall ones. Also adding a rear diffuser, typical on other race cars but very new for stock cars. \n\nBUT,  one of the bigger changes is that they are running more road courses than they used to, racing at tracks like Circuit of the Americas, Watkins Glen, and a favourite of mine - the Charlotte Roval.\nSo stock cars aren‚Äôt just for turning left, and they have shown that in recent seasons. But, not in the same way GT cars or prototypes can handle Le Mans for 24 hours though, right?\n\n\nüìπ All source footage can be found here üëâ  https://bit.ly/3CySBjZ\n\n‚û§Follow Driver61 on:\n   ‚û§ Instagram- @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n   ‚û§TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok\n\n‚û§ Follow Scott on:\n   ‚û§ Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell\n   ‚û§ Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n\n#NASCAR #LeMans #Motorsport","title":"How NASCAR was FASTER than Ferrari at Le Mans","duration":640,"channel_id":"UCtbLA0YM6EpwUQhFUyPQU9Q","author":"Driver61","date":"20230617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNIEgqZBScw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kNIEgqZBScw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1345102}}

It‚Äôs powered by an incredible 5-litre twin-turbo V8 that delivers an eye-watering 1,360kg and 1,573Nm of torque. It‚Äôs equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and sends all of its power to the rear wheels. It‚Äôs also super light, tipping the scales at 1,395kg, and it‚Äôs easily the most expensive car Mat has ever drag-raced, with an estimated value of ¬£3,500,000!! \n\nAlongside it, we have the Tesla Model S Plaid. It‚Äôs equipped with three motors, and they combine to put down 1,020hp and 1,420Nm, with all of this power being sent to all four wheels. Naturally, being electric, it‚Äôs weighed down a bit by the batteries and motors, and as a result, it weighs in at 2,190kg. \n\nThen finally we have the Hayabusa. But this is no usual Suzuki Hayabusa! It‚Äôs had a supercharger fitted to it, and as a result, its 1.3-litre 4-cylinder engine produces 385hp and 280Nm of torque! This power is sent to the rear wheels, and of course, it‚Äôs oh-so light, weighing in at 257kg. \n\nSo how will this one play out - will the electric power of the Tesla propel it to victory? Or will either the Koenigsegg or Hayabusa sneak it? There‚Äôs only one way to find out‚Ä¶ LET‚ÄôS RACE!\n\n\nMat‚Äôs quickest 1/4-mile EVER: https://bit.ly/Mats-Quickest-Launch-Ever\n\nFerrari SF90 v Tesla Model S Plaid v Porsche 911 Turbo S: https://bit.ly/Ferrari-SF90-v-Model-S-Plaid-v-911-Turbo\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"Koenigsegg v Tesla Plaid v Turbo Hayabusa: DRAG RACE","duration":1160,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6jMR7-NZMM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/J6jMR7-NZMM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3915173}}
