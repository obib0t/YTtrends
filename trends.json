{"description":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) 6th Mini Album [HARMONY : ALL IN]\n‘JUMP’ MV\n\n[Apple Music] : https://music.apple.com/kr/album/jump/1690536589?i=1690536590\n[Melon] : https://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=11260282\n[Spotify] : https://open.spotify.com/album/67nhgkEfNwdqQt7QFYHw0B\n\nP1Harmony(피원하모니)는 ‘부조화(DISHARMONY)’ 3부작 시리즈부터 ‘조화(HARMONY)’ 시리즈까지 우리를 규정짓는 틀과 부조리함에 맞서며 더 나은 세상을 만들기 위해 쉼 없이 달려왔다. 여섯 번째 미니 앨범 ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’은 ‘HARMONY’ 시리즈의 마지막 여정으로, 필수불가결한 존재인 물을 통해 조화로운 세계를 완성하는 모습을 그려냈다. \n\n앨범명 ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’은 조화로운 세상을 위해 모든 것을 바치는 피원하모니의 의지를 담았다. 타이틀곡 ‘JUMP’는 힙합 베이스의 사운드로 진행되는 얼터너티브 팝 장르의 댄스곡이다. 고민하고 망설이기보다는 지금 이 감정을 즐기며 함께 더 높이 ‘JUMP’하며 올라가자는 피원하모니의 외침이 자유롭고 역동적인 퍼포먼스로 담겼다. \n\n타이틀곡 ‘JUMP’ 외에도 피아노 리프가 인상적인 힙합곡 ‘Love Me For Me’, 힙합 느낌의 신스 사운드와 808베이스 리프 구성이 매력적인 ‘New Classic’, 몽환적인 신스 사운드에 다채로운 보컬이 조화를 이루는 ‘More Than Words’, 팝 댄스곡 ‘Heartbeat Drum’, 슬로우 템포의 R&B 장르의 ‘I Am You’까지 총 여섯 곡이 수록되었다. \n \n‘HARMONY’ 시리즈의 마지막, 미니 6집으로 비로소 완벽한 세상을 완성한 피원하모니. 이번 앨범은 피원하모니 또한 물처럼 필수불가결한 그룹임을 깨닫게 해줄 완성도 높은 앨범이 될 것이다.\n\nFrom the ‘DISHARMONY’ trilogy to the ‘HARMONY’ series, P1Harmony has been working tirelessly to create a better world by confronting frames and absurdities that define us. The 6th Mini Album, ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’ is the final page of the ‘HARMONY’ series, depicting the completion of the harmonious world through water, which is an indispensable element\n\nThe album title ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’ reflects P1Harmony’s spirit of dedicating everything to the harmonious world. The title song ‘JUMP’ is a dance music of alternative pop genre with hip-hop based sound. A free and dynamic performance captures P1Harmony’s message to “JUMP” higher together while enjoying the feelings at the moment rather than worrying and hesitating.\n\nIn addition to the title track, ‘JUMP’, a total of six tracks are included in this album: a hip-hop track with an impressive piano riff, ‘Love Me For Me,’ ‘New Classic’ featuring a hip-hop-like synth sound and 808 bass riff, ‘More Than Words,’ with a dreamy synth sound and colorful vocals, a pop dance song, ‘Heartbeat Drum,’ and ‘I Am You,’ a slow-tempo R&B song.\n \nThe last in the 'HARMONY' series, P1Harmony has completed the perfect world with the 6th Mini Album. This album will be a high quality album that will make you realize that P1Harmony is also an indispensable group like water.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_official\n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_members\n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official\n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TIKTOK : https://www.tiktok.com/@p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #6th_Mini_Album #HARMONY #ALLIN #JUMP","title":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) – ‘JUMP’ MV","duration":193,"channel_id":"UCZECMCJJJE47ei170XCXgdA","author":"FNCEnt","date":"20230608","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hc1OjFxv-M","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Hc1OjFxv-M/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":12815367}}

To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMB01VDG34ZD46WY","title":"We have a small problem...","duration":1846,"channel_id":"UCZkGmgbBziqGCYI3x9hVQPg","author":"Tyler and Todd","date":"20230604","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesQzx5tJnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/VesQzx5tJnE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":158760}}

Hosted by 18-time major champion Jack Nicklaus, it is one of the PGA TOUR’s longest-running events at the same venue, having debuted at Muirfield Village in 1976. Billy Horschel returns this week to defend his title from 2022. His four-stroke victory marked his seventh PGA TOUR win last time out. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler also heads to Muirfield Village after finishing tied for third in last week’s Charles Schwab Challenge. He finished just one stroke outside of the Emiliano Grillo and Adam Schenk playoff. Grillo and Schenk will also be competing this week, looking to bring their hot hands to the Memorial Tournament. FedExCup Standings leader Jon Rahm and world No. 3 Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up at Muirfield Village. Rahm won the tournament in 2020 by three strokes. Two-time tournament champion Patrick Cantlay heads back to Ohio aiming to get a third win under his belt, and his close friend Xander Schauffele will aim to grab his first title here after four top-20 finishes in five starts at the Memorial Tournament. Jordan Spieth, Viktor Hovland, Matt Fitzpatrick and Justin Thomas will also look for their first wins at Nicklaus’ signature event.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","title":"Highlights | Round 4 | the Memorial | 2023","duration":699,"channel_id":"UCKwGZZMrhNYKzucCtTPY2Nw","author":"PGA TOUR","date":"20230604","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRPpay6bpHs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eRPpay6bpHs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":317563}}
{"description":"Go to https://squarespace.com/vanwives to get a free trial and 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain \n\nWelcome back, Pack! With our never-ending renovations, improvements and gardening we've been doing this spring, we've decided to give our tired and sore backs some help by tag-teaming in a legend in the world of gardening: THE TRACTOR! A 2012 Kubota B26, bright orange tractor with 1800 hours on it to be precise 🤠 That's right, through a twist of fate and a bit of good fortune, we were able to get one recently and it's beautiful. And we need YOUR help in naming it! Please comment your names below! 👇 But first we have to learn how to drive it, use the bucket, backhoe and forklift. This thing turns on a dime, lifts giant payloads with ease, and is generally so much fun to drive that maybe we're going to become the TractorWives?! Okay maybe not just yet, but we're in love with this tractor. Maybe we can even start a new landscaping side-hustle: C&J's Landscaping! Has a nice ring to it, eh? No more walking on sharp rocks, breaking our backs lifting for hours a day. The backhoe mode is kind of the opposite of the lifter mode, and after some trial and error, we were able to plant our first cedar tree with it. For anyone who's never operated a tractor before, it's almost like playing a video game like Smash Brothers, where your button inputs suddenly become backwards. We're so happy! We also checked in on our little seedlings in our green house and are so excited to show you how much they've grown already 🌞 And we're finally creating a pathway for our fruit garden. We can't wait to see what new projects we can complete with our new tractor friend.

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.
