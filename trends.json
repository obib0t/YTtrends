People are made of cells, cells are made of molecules, molecules are made of atoms, atoms are made of electrons, protons, and neutrons. And protons are each made of three up or down quarks. Simple stuff, right? All except for that last part. Protons are actually made of many, many quarks that happen to look like three only when we look at them in a particular way. And even then, sometimes they‚Äôre made of 5 quarks - including the charm quark.\n\nCheck Our Matt on Star Talk with Neil deGrasse Tyson\n https://youtu.be/OcX7xpxOC2U \n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\nSearch the Entire Space Time Library Here: https://search.pbsspacetime.com/\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Fernando Franco F√©lix & Matt O'Dowd \nPost Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini, Adriano Leal & Stephanie Faria\nDirected by Andrew Kornhaber\nAssociate Producer: Bahar Gholipour\nExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew Kornhaber\nExecutive in Charge for PBS: Maribel Lopez\nDirector of Programming for PBS: Gabrielle Ewing\nAssistant Director of Programming for PBS: John Campbell\n\nSpacetime is produced by Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.\nThis program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.\n¬© 2023 PBS.

{"description":"The new champion Naafiri is here!\nThanks to Riot Games for providing some of the assets in this video!\nPurchase RP here (Amazon Affiliate - NA): https://amzn.to/2qZ3Bmv\nVideo contains Naafiri Abilities descriptions.\n\n00:00 Passive - We are More\n00:23 Q - Darkin Dagger \n00:39 W - Hound's Pursuit\n00:56 E - Eviscerate\n01:11 R - The Call of the Pack\n01:23 Gameplay Examples\n03:35 Petting the Dog\n\n\nPassive - We Are More \nNaafiri creates a Packmate after an amount of time that will attack enemies that she targets for physical damage, which is increased after she uses an ability. Hitting champions with abilities or killing enemies reduces this ability‚Äôs cooldown.\n \n\nQ - Darkin Daggers \nNaafiri hurls Darkin-tainted blades, dealing physical damage and inflicting a bleed for a few seconds.This ability may be recast. If enemies hit are already bleeding, instead deal the remaining bleed damage plus bonus physical damage and missing health physical damage. If the target was a champion, Naafiri restores some health. Packmates will leap at the first target hit, prioritizing champions and attacking them for a few seconds.\n \n\nW - Hounds‚Äô Pursuit  \nAfter a brief delay, Naafiri dashes at an enemy, dealing physical damage and briefly slowing her target or the first champion she collides with. This ability gains range based on ultimate rank. Packmates become untargetable and dash alongside Naafiri, dealing additional damage per Packmate.\n \n\nE - Eviscerate  \nNaafiri surges forward, dashing and dealing physical damage to enemies she passes through, then explodes outward, dealing additional physical damage. Packmates are recalled to Naafiri and are healed to full.\n \n\nR - The Call of the Pack  \nNaafiri prepares to hunt, empowering her Packmates and spawning bonus Packmates for a short duration. Naafiri then gains a burst of out of combat Movespeed, vision, and the first time she hits an enemy champion, she gains a shield. On first champion takedown, all ultimate effects are refreshed.","title":"Naafiri Ability Reveal | New Champion","duration":241,"channel_id":"UC0NwzCHb8Fg89eTB5eYX17Q","author":"SkinSpotlights","date":"20230622","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VSAyTmw0Lc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/3VSAyTmw0Lc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1490911}}

{"description":"Today, the entry point for going mountain biking just got a little bit lower. The Ozark Trail Ridge, a $398 bicycle sold at Walmart stores, actually seems like it would be worth owning‚Äîthat is if you‚Äôre okay with rebuilding it after you take it home.\n\nMy criticism of department store bikes was NEVER that they are cheap, it was always that they are ridiculous. Why does a $150 bicycle have 18 gears and rear suspension? Why not put that money towards better parts and serviceability? I‚Äôll tell you why. The simplest bike with the fewest features looks like a terrible deal to an inexperienced buyer.\n\nBut some of us are, in fact, looking for a simple and affordable bike that‚Äôs easy to service and possible to upgrade, and the Ozark Trail Ridge was clearly designed with that in mind. Today, I‚Äôm going to show you the Ridge and all the reasons it‚Äôs the best department store bike in its price range.\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-29-Ridge-Mountain-Bike-Medium-Frame-Gray/1656914661\n\nUPDATE: BACKCOUNTRY BASH HAS BEEN CANCELLED.

{"description":"Having lived in Boston their whole life and now balancing living in two places at once, Nick, Matt, and Chris aren't your run everyday siblings. Better known as the Sturniolo Triplets, these social media power houses spend most of their lives in front of the camera, making content for the millions of fans who have come to know and love them. But what happens when the cameras are off, and these three aren't coming up with the next piece of content? Well, on the Cut the Camera podcast, Nick, Matt, and Chris are going to give their fans the unfiltered, real-to-life experience of hanging out with them as they share who they are when no one is watching. There are stories and thoughts that don't fit into a TikTok video. There are subjects that are worth a deeper dive. Nick, Matt, and Chris are here to bring you along for the ride as they continue to shape and define who they are and what obstacles they need to overcome as they live a life in the public eye. From mental health, to ridiculous questions and theories along with special guests, this podcast is here to give you even more of what you already know and love from the Sturniolo Triplets. So, grab your beverage of choice, a bag of chips, and follow along as we Cut the Camera.\n\nCut The Camera Podcast\nCo-hosts: Nick Sturniolo, Matt Sturniolo and Chris Sturniolo\nPodcast produced by Z Star Studios \nRecording & Editing by Z Star Studios\nDistribution Partner | Studio 71\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Social with The Sturniolo Triplets\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@SturnioloTriplets\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sturniolo.triplets\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sturniolo.triplets\n\nFor Brand Partnerships with The Sturniolo Triplets please email: triplets@zstardigital.com","title":"Cut The Camera | Podcast Trailer","duration":136,"channel_id":"UCllieDKASOsUh_rTF58a04Q","author":"Cut The Camera Podcast (by the sturniolo triplets)","date":"20230619","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Crk0heiq5I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/7Crk0heiq5I/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":235041}}

{"description":"First Things First host Nick Wright joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the Bradley Beal-Phoenix Suns trade, including whether the new star will help or hurt his new team. Watch as Nick explains why the Suns new Big 3 will not get closer to the Denver Nuggets nor live up to the NBA Finals hype. He then dives into the level of pressure on Kevin Durant with Beal joining Phoenix, explaining why he may have 'one box unchecked but no pressure on him for the team to win' outside of his legacy. Nick also reacts to Michael Malone taking a jab at LeBron James while on The Pat McAfee Show. Watch as Nick discusses whether Michael Jordan's failure as the Charlotte Hornets owner diminishes his legacy or not.\n\n#TheHerd #NBA #BradleyBeal\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb \n \n‚ñ∫Watch the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/LatestOnTheHerd \n\n‚ñ∂The Carton Show's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n‚ñ∂First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n‚ñ∫UNDISPUTED‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED \n‚ñ∫Speak‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n‚ñ∫FOX Bet Live‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n‚ñ∫The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n‚ñ∫What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from THE HERD: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFoxSports \nLike THE HERD on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFacebook \nFollow THE HERD on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDTwitter \nFollow THE HERD on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDInstagram \n\nFollow Colin Cowherd on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ColinCowherdTwitter \n \nAbout The Herd with Colin Cowherd:\nThe Herd with Colin Cowherd is a three-hour sports television and radio show on FS1 and iHeartRadio.

He is the President of a nonprofit organization called Laughing At My Nightmare, and a renowned public speaker who has performed across the country at places such as Harvard University, The University of Florida, The University of Connecticut, Princeton University, and many more.\n\nHannah Burcaw (she/her) graduated from Carleton College, where she studied Sociology and Anthropology. She films and edits the ‚ÄúSquirmy and Grubs‚Äù vlog, which has over 1,000,000 subscribers on YouTube. Hannah has spoken at prestigious universities and Fortune 500 companies alike about the realities of ableism. On her popular Instagram account, she advocates for acceptance of all people and works to improve the way society thinks about disability.\n\nShane and Hannah have been together for over four years. They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together.","title":"Egg Retrieval Time! - IVF Journey Part 3","duration":889,"channel_id":"UCdomP1JqhnyBQGaBmfDl4KQ","author":"Squirmy and Grubs","date":"20230619","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvzJp5dMsq0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JvzJp5dMsq0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":351598}}
