The weekend develops into what can only be described as a culture clash, leaving Sebastian and Salvo to discover that the great thing about family is everything about family.\nABOUT MY FATHER is directed by Laura Terruso and written by Austen Earl & Sebastian Maniscalco.\n\nLionsgate presents, a Depth of Field production.","title":"About My Father (2023) Official Trailer ‚Äì Sebastian Maniscalco, Robert De Niro, Leslie Bibb","duration":167,"channel_id":"UCJ6nMHaJPZvsJ-HmUmj1SeA","author":"Lionsgate Movies","date":"20230222","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txLSE7tpgr0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/txLSE7tpgr0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":611936}}

{"description":"ALL OF THOSE VOICES. THE FEATURE LENGTH DOCUMENTARY FILM. IN CINEMAS WORLDWIDE FROM MARCH 22ND: https://allofthosevoices.com\n\nAll Of Those Voices:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/allofthosevoices\nhttps://tiktok.com/@allofthosevoices\nhttps://twitter.com/AOTVFilm\nhttps://www.facebook.com/allofthosevoices\n\nAll Of Those Voices takes a refreshingly raw and real look at Louis Tomlinson's musical journey. Ditching the typical glossy sheen of celebrity documentaries, this film gives audiences an intimate and unvarnished view of Louis' life and career. Through never-before-seen home movie footage and behind the scenes access to Louis‚Äô sell-out 2022 World Tour, All Of Those Voices offers a unique perspective on what it's like to be a musician in today's fast-paced world.\n\nFrom the highs of superstardom to the lows of personal tragedy, Louis' story is one of resilience and determination. The film explores his journey from a member of One Direction to a solo artist, capturing the challenges and triumphs that defined his path. Since the acclaimed release of his debut album ‚ÄòWalls‚Äô and documenting the creation of his chart topping 2022 album ‚ÄòFaith In The Future‚Äô, the film shows a side of Louis that fans have never seen before, as he grapples with the pressures of fame and the weight of his own voice.\n\nDirected by Charlie Lightening, the filmmaker behind the award-winning As It Was, All Of Those Voices is a story about the power of self-discovery and the courage it takes to be true to oneself. With a focus on honesty and vulnerability, this film is a refreshingly down-to-earth take on the life of a musician, capturing the real-life struggles and triumphs of a man who refused to be silenced by anyone else's expectations.\n\nFollow Louis Tomlinson:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Louis_Tomlinson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/louist91\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/louis.tomlinson\nWebsite: https://www.louis-tomlinson.com\n\nFaith In The Future.

{"description":"Some Washington D.C. lawmakers want to limit Wall Street's role in the housing market. In recent years, a small but mighty group of corporations bought hundreds of thousands of homes in sunbelt-region suburbs. These homes are traditionally a crucial investment for American families. But rising home prices are shutting would-be homebuyers out of the market.  Meanwhile, financial groups are profiting from rising rents while their subsidiaries build small amounts of new standalone homes in the U.S.\n\nSince the early 2010s, Tricon Residential, Progress Residential, American Homes 4 Rent, Invitation Homes have each bought thousands of homes. They've also added to the housing supply in some cases with built-for-rent communities.Some of these companies are financed by private equity firms like Blackstone and investment managers like Pretium Partners.\n\n\"It's almost a captive market\" said Jordan Ash, director of Labor-Jobs and Housing at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. \"They've been very explicit about how people are shut out of the homebuying market and are going to be perpetual renters.\"\n\nThese calls come after fierce housing inflation hit many Sun Belt states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia, according to the National Association of Realtors.¬†\n\nBy 2030, the institutions may hold some 7.6 million homes, or more than 40% of all single-family rentals on the market, according to the 2022 forecast by MetLife Investment Management.\n\nWatch the video above to learn about the rise and future of corporate landlords in the United States.\n\nChapters: \n01:28 ‚Äî Chapter 1: Landlords\n05:02 ‚Äî Chapter 2: Housing stock\n07:55 ‚Äî Chapter 3: Homebuying \n09:46 ‚Äî Chapter 4: Solutions \n\nProduced by: Carlos Waters\nSupervising Producer: Lindsey Jacobson\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\nAdditional Production by: Bryan Rager\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC:¬†https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV:¬†https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

{"description":"What does your chosen family look like? Do you resonate with Lilo?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker, filmmaker Alan Seawright, and guest Rebecca Parham of @LetMeExplainStudios are reacting to the beloved Lilo and Stitch. It is Rebecca‚Äôs favorite movie, and it‚Äôs admired by so many for its portrayal of neurodivergent and autistic people. They discuss how Lilo‚Äôs neurodivergence makes her unique but misunderstood by her peers and adults. They discuss the emotional burden of having a broken family and how they heal through their shared value of Ohana. Alan praises Chris Sanders for vocalizing Stitch in a way that‚Äôs monstrous but also cute, and Rebecca gives credit to the directors for doing their research to accurately represent Hawaii and Hawaiian culture. And, of course, they cry. \n\nThank you to our Patrons for picking this episode!

{"description":"One man was killed and four others were injured when a gunman started shooting near the St. Charles Avenue Carnival parade route in New Orleans on Sunday.\n\nThe Krewe of Bacchus was close to the end when gunshots rang out near St. Charles Avenue and Terpsichore Street. New Orleans police say the shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. in front of the Hoshun Restaurant, just steps from where a large crowd lined the street enjoying the Mardi Gras festivities.\n\nThe shooting injured a young girl, a woman, and three men. All five victims were taken to a hospital where one of the men later died.\n\n\"We don't know what happened prior to that, but we did hear gunshots and our officers responded as well as other agencies very quickly. And we were able to find two weapons on scene and also apprehend what we believe to be the shooter,\" NOPD Deputy Chief Hans Ganthier said.\n\nAn eyewitness told WWL-TV that at least a dozen shots were fired and that people were falling all over themselves trying to get out of the way, leaving everything they had behind them. He said prior to the shooting, there was a set of skirmishes in the same area that officers broke up.\n\n\"Everyone ran. Everyone took cover. My whole family ducked. I kind of just hovered over my family, like the small children,\" Andrew Crawford said.\n\nThe Bacchus parade was temporarily halted in the 1500 block of St. Charles Avenue after the shooting. An officer said that the parade would resume to \"get out of the way\" of the crime scene but that they wouldn't throw anything while in that area.\n\n\n\"This is not something we wanted to see. We really wanted to be a safe Mardi Gras and we continue to work toward that end,\" Ganthier said.\n\nThe police department could not say if the man they took into custody was the sole shooter on the parade route. The shooting remains under investigation.\n\nThe NOPD is asking anyone with information about the shooting to call Crimestoppers of Greater New Orleans at 504-822-1111.","title":"Panic after deadly shooting on New Orleans parade route","duration":180,"channel_id":"UCJCreS7pODbA6XYRsI5fdLg","author":"WWLTV","date":"20230220","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTlsS514z1g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YTlsS514z1g/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":435091}}

{"description":"Matt called and said he was having issues with his transfer case in The Heavy Wrecker and might not make it to King Of The Hammers. So I loaded up some parts from Off-Road Design and headed over to help. We got all the parts swapped over to the standard Np205 and mated up the ORD Magnum Box and got it all mounted in the Heavy Wrecker. The next morning we took it out for a quick shake down run. Had a couple issues... One being some loose wiring and one being the steering column broke, but we were there to help him get it back together and keep going. I appreciate @MattsOffRoadRecovery allowing me to help them get this beast up and going and able to make it out to The Hammers.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.

You see shoutouts to \"WHY\", \"LET YOU DOWN\", \"OUTCAST\", \"MANSION\", and several more NF songs.\n\nBECOME A CHANNEL MEMBER HERE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCpbrIr6hlIPd2EOTZxVBJw/join\n\n‚ñ∫Business Inquiries: cryptbusinessllc@gmail.com\n\n‚ñ∫Sports Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwX3_mpYFKOJREdnOHD16LQ\n\n‚ñ∫Podcast Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7sFMMoM89vgcgDOUG9XMxQ\n\n‚ñ∫ Merch: https://www.crypttherapper.com/shop\n\n‚ñ∫ Instagram: https://instagram.com/CryptTheRapper\n\n‚ñ∫ Twitter: https://twitter.com/CryptTheRapper\n\n‚ñ∫ Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1WIHbvNZTybCVHFMbzuGJo\n\n‚ñ∫ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/crypttherapperOG/\n\n‚ñ∫ Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/crypt-226456644\n\nI'm a fat, white YouTube rapper and damn proud of it.
