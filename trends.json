The mod works with custom (GTX) raytracing that I coded/programmed myself, which was incredibly hard to do. This was very funny to work on though, I really enjoy the final result and I hope you guys like it as well! It took forever haha\n\n#Fundy #Minecraft","title":"So I Turned Minecraft Into a Horror Game...","duration":901,"channel_id":"UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw","author":"Fundy","date":"20230519","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shRrnUQyE54","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/shRrnUQyE54/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1516922}}

{"description":"Get your tickets, you poor unfortunate souls, Disney's #TheLittleMermaid is coming to theaters May 26! 🐙🔮🎶\n\n“The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) as the voice of Sebastian; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca”) as the voice of Flounder; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”) with a screenplay by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”). The songs feature music from multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”) and lyrics by Howard Ashman, and new lyrics by three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), Miranda, two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), and Rob Marshall, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer.

{"description":"Fallout 4 is a perfectly balanced Post apocalyptic RPG created by Bethesda who are most known for the amazing elder scrolls skyrim. Famously Todd Howard designed fallout 4 to be perfectly balanced so today I have decided to make every npc and enemy in fallout legendary. That means you can now face up against legendary radroaches and every raider you face might be holding a legendary super upgraded rocket launcher capable of mini nuking your limbs off. So all of the classic strongest enemy tier lists and top 10 strongest weapons are out the window as its time to see if a legendary 100 stat man can survive in a legendary world. \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience or I suppose as today is an mmo game asmongold. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:32 - Creating the Gigachad!\n03:08 - Our first encounters\n05:04 - 100 Stat Man?!?\n08:08 - Intro the world we go\n09:57 - Saving the Minutemen\n12:15 - Chad vs. Deathclaw\n14:03 - A behemoth of Legendary proportions\n17:04 - Moving towards Diamond City\n19:06 - Halfway there\n21:05 - Braving the Glowing Sea\n22:29 - Creating the ultimate weapon!\n24:57 - The Final Battle!\n26:26 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\ntitle: FALLOUT But EVERYTHING Is Legendary And Overpowered - A Perfectly Balanced Fallout 4 Mod \n\n#fallout #legendary #game","title":"FALLOUT But EVERYTHING Is Legendary And Overpowered - A Perfectly Balanced Fallout 4 Mod","duration":1617,"channel_id":"UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ","author":"The Spiffing Brit","date":"20230517","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ULVIgc6E4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u1ULVIgc6E4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":737935}}

{"description":"Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by RuPaul to tour his dazzling Beverly Hills home. When the 'Drag Race' star and husband Georges LeBar acquired their home they enlisted esteemed AD100 designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard and architect Christopher Hatch McLean to help bring their 1980s palazzo to life. Together they transformed the property into an enchanting homage to Old Hollywood injecting the glamor of 1930s regency throughout. Bursting with color and pattern, RuPaul wanted the design of his home to evoke joy in those who step inside its doors - “The house is a touchstone to remind me to inspire people to feel the magic that’s seemingly so elusive these days,” RuPaul asserts. “It’s meant to be whimsical and fun. None of it is to be taken too seriously—except for love and kindness.”\r\n\r\nSee more of RuPaul's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/rupaul-beverly-hills-home\r\n\r\nShop RuPaul’s home style!\r\n\r\nWallpaper: \r\n(Similar) Etsy Vintage Landscape Wallpaper: https://fave.co/3M751nv\r\n(Similar) Etsy Black and White Stripe Wallpaper: https://fave.co/44ZX1xj\r\n(Similar) Etsy Leopard Wallpaper: https://fave.co/41xVA6p\r\n\r\nAccessories: \r\n(Similar) Amazon 8” Disco Ball: https://amzn.to/3Oe7dMQ\r\n(Similar) Etsy Donna Summer in Cat Eye Glasses: https://fave.co/3MqaN54\r\n(Similar) Etsy Diana Ross Canvas Print: https://fave.co/3MsIDX1\r\n(Similar) Etsy Glass Mannequin Head: https://fave.co/3BtcqIW\r\n(Similar) Etsy Chevron Pillow: https://fave.co/41BVPNQ\r\n(Similar) Rejuvenation Large Antique Terracotta Planter: https://fave.co/3MdvMqC\r\nNeiman Marcus Les Ottomans Ikat Gold Wine Glasses: https://fave.co/3M7W0KO\r\nNeiman Marcus Les Ottomans Ikat Gold Tumbler Glasses: https://fave.co/42DZb4b\r\n(Similar) Etsy Snake Napkin Rings: https://fave.co/42DZlbN\r\nMoro Head Lady Vase: https://fave.co/41IQ0xP\r\n(Similar) Amazon Resin Sculpture: https://amzn.to/3MuA4ey\r\n(Similar) Etsy Large Marble Serving Bowl: https://fave.co/3Mv7dXv\r\n(Similar) Etsy Malachite Obelisks: https://fave.co/42AVNqt\r\n\r\nFurniture: \r\n(Similar) Kathy Kuo Home Regency Lacquer Chair: https://fave.co/3o211ga\r\n(Similar) 1stdibs Louis XV Armchairs, Pair: https://fave.co/42WI2lP\r\n(Similar) Etsy Louis XV Noir Desk: https://fave.co/3W3mQbM\r\n\r\nLighting: \r\nLumens Hexsation Pendant by Martyn Lawrence Bullard: https://fave.co/3M3LdBn\r\n(Similar) Kathy Kuo Home Saura Coastal Beach Leaf Pendant: https://fave.co/3WcLLcT\r\n(Similar) SoHo Home Treviso Chandelier: https://fave.co/3IaDgcB\r\n1stdibs Pair of Chocolate Honeycomb Lamps by Gerald Thurston: https://fave.co/3W21zzb\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nDirector: Hiatt Woods\r\nDirector of Photography: Grant Bell\r\nEditor: Alex Mechanik\r\nHost: RuPaul\r\nProducer: Chase Lewis\r\nLine Producer: Joe Buscemi\r\nAssociate Producer: Josh Crowe\r\nProduction Manager: Peter Brunette\r\nTalent Booker: Dana Mathews\r\nCamera Operator: Malcolm Cook\r\nAudio: Cassiano Pereira\r\nProduction Assistant: Fernando Barajas\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Andrew Montague\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\r\nSupervising Editor: Christina Mankellow\r\nJunior Editor: Paul Tael\r\nAssistant Editor: Justin Symonds\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

{"description":"The end of the road begins Friday. Watch the FINAL TRAILER Now. #FASTX \n\nGet tickets now: https://tickets.fastxmovie.com/\n\nThe end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga","title":"FAST X | Final Trailer","duration":272,"channel_id":"UCJCx8aQrdx_ueXPmxTD2odQ","author":"The Fast Saga","date":"20230515","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoOaKN4qCKw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eoOaKN4qCKw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":8093389}}

{"description":"Anamaria Sayre | May 15, 2023\nArriving at the Tiny Desk not long after becoming the first female artist to have a Spanish-language album top the Billboard 200 chart, Colombian singer Karol G shined brighter than ever. With an all-female crew backing her, the proud energia femenina and the prowess of a band dominated exclusively by women is undeniably brilliant here. It was also the first time in many years, she said, that she hadn't rehearsed without her typical on-stage equipment, like in-ear monitors. \"I forgot how cool it feels,\" she said. Authenticity isn't a prescription for Karol G, it's a natural state — something that she carries with her, waiting for the next opportunity to reveal another version of Carolina.\n\n\"CAROLINA,\" her given name, was also the title of the opening track of her performance, as she got to jamming in a manner atypical for the superstar. Trading her flute and trumpet for an accordion and tuba she \"bring[s] some Mexican vibe to this place,\" she said, with \"GUCCI LOS PAÑOS.\" She paused between songs and offered a cheers to the room, admitting that she had meant to sip her Mezcalito before the previous song.\n\nShe emphasized the rawness of the moment by slowing things down for a stripped down, reggae-leaning version of \"PERO TÚ.\" Sliding seamlessly into a bossa nova-esque \"MERCURIO\" — the version she wishes she'd included on the album — \"La Bichota\" brought the music back up and danced herself off stage. Away from the stadium lights, Karol G's performance wasn't just a blip of normalcy for the pop star — it was permission from the self-described \"happy-heartbreak girl\" to get up, whether in the streets of Medellín or an office in Washington, D.C., and dance with every version of yourself.\n\nSET LIST\n\"CAROLINA\"\n\"GUCCI LOS PAÑOS\"\n\"PERO TÚ\"\n\"MERCURIO\" \n\nMUSICIANS\nCarolina Giraldo (Karol G): vocals\nSusana Vasquez: guitar \nJemma Heigis: piano\nGiulliana Merello: drums\nPatricia Ligia: bass\nCrystal Torres: trumpet\nHailey-Mae Niswanger: flute\nKatiuska Fernandes: percussion\nIrany Martinez: accordion\nIndia Anderson: tuba\nRob Trujillo: musical director\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre \nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nVideographers:  Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Pilar Galván, Jill Britton\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #eltiny #karolg","title":"Karol G: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1021,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230515","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8UWsFMVj_Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8UWsFMVj_Q/hqdefault.jpg?v=645e62a6","content":{"View count":1901690}}

{"description":"“Part of Your World”\nPerformed by Halle Bailey\nFrom Disney’s The Little Mermaid\nSoundtrack available May 19\n\nFilm in theaters May 26: https://www.fandango.com/the-little-mermaid-2023-228960/movie-overview\n\n“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.\n\nSubscribe to DisneyMusicVEVO 🔔 for all the latest Disney music videos: https://www.youtube.com/@DisneyMusicVEVO?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Disney Music: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic\n\nMusic video by Halle Bailey performing Performs “Part of Your World” at Disneyland. © 2023 Walt Disney Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/FNuQVO","title":"Halle Bailey - Performs “Part of Your World” at Disneyland","duration":212,"channel_id":"UCgwv23FVv3lqh567yagXfNg","author":"DisneyMusicVEVO","date":"20230515","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCKna5ZoyN4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BCKna5ZoyN4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2918193}}

{"description":"The Calorie Challenge Almost No One Can Complete\nStart your own 90-Day Body Transformation today: https://bit.ly/BrowneyChallenge 💪\n\nThe average man eats and burns 2500 calories a day. But some people like Dwayne The Rock Johnson plan an insane cheat day where they eat an insane amount of calories consisting of their favorite foods where their childhood dream comes true. The Rock loves sushi, Chris Hemsworth loves pizza, Selena Gomez likes chocolate, Cristiano Ronaldo his go-to cheat meal is steak and salad, Rihanna loves her fries, Elon Musk has a long taste and Mark doesn't eat.\n\nBut I never plan on a full cheat day where I eat all those delicious foods... but I found an excuse.\nThere is a challenge on the internet that almost no one has completed and that is eating and burning 10.000 calories in a single day.\nSo let’s have our dream cheat day! But hopefully, end the day without any damage...\nShout out to  @WillTennyson  &  @JoeFazer  for the idea\n\nCheck these out:\n● Gymshark: http://gym.sh/Shop-Browney (Code: Stan)\n● MyProtein: http://tidd.ly/a5f49f61 (Code: Browney)\n● The 90-Day Challenge Course: https://bit.ly/BrowneyChallenge \n\nInstagram: @StanBrowney @GuyInTheBlueShirt\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stanbrowney/\n\nFor business inquiries: TeamBrowney@scooperz.com\nCopyright issues?
