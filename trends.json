We ran our first test piece early because we were at a stage where we needed more cables from viewers -- we got some! With the help of our audience sending in a few failed cables, we were able to reach 3 firm conclusions (or, really, 2+1) of causes for failures of these adapter cables (and unadapted ones, too). Of course, there may be even more reasons -- but we believe these 3 to be the primary ones. Between foreign object debris in manufacturing (seems uncommon, but a cause) and user error, we were able to make a few cables melt. On the user error front, remember one key thing: Even if yours doesn't start fully unseated and is only partly unseated, it can work its way loose over time if you move cables around, do some cleanup, move the system, etc.\n\nWatch our first video in this series! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIKjZ1djp8c\n\nNew GN 3D Coaster Pack: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-drink-debug-coaster-pack-4-custom-3d-coasters-100x100mm-4x4\nGN PC Building Anti-Static Modmat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat-volt-large\nGN Red & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-red-black-hud-mouse-mat\nGN Blue & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-wireframe-mouse-mat\n\r\nLike our content?

{"description":"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - Only In Theaters this Christmas\n\nThis holiday season, everyone‚Äôs favorite leche-loving, swashbuckling, fear-defying feline returns.  \n\nFor the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. \n\nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Softpaws (Oscar¬Æ nominee Salma Hayek Pinault). \n\nIn their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided‚Äîagainst their better judgment‚Äîby a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perrito (Harvey Guill√©n, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldi (Oscar¬Æ nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, the big, bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).\n \nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish features an all-star comedic cast that includes Oscar¬Æ winner Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone (Black Widow), Samson Kayo (Sliced), Emmy nominee Anthony Mendez (Jane the Virgin) and Tony nominee Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Trolls World Tour).  \n \nThe long-awaited follow-up to the 2011 Academy Award¬Æ-nominated blockbuster, The Last Wish is directed by Joel Crawford and produced by Mark Swift, the creative team behind DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs smash, The Croods: A New Age. The film‚Äôs executive producer is Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri. \n \nThe character of Puss in Boots first appeared in 2004‚Äôs Oscar¬Æ-nominated Shrek 2 and instantly became a global, scene-stealing sensation. Puss then co-starred in two other Shrek sequels and his solo film, as well as in multiple DreamWorks Animation videos and TV series. The Shrek and Puss in Boots films have collectively earned more than $3.5 billion worldwide. \n\nSocial Handles\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pussinboots \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Dreamworks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pussinboots  \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@pussinboots\nWebsite: https://www.PussInBootsMovie.com \n#PussInBoots","title":"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - Official Trailer 3","duration":177,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20221115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHb7WlgyaUc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tHb7WlgyaUc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":7483996}}

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé\n\n00:00 Stairway to Heaven, explained\n00:49 Are we prepared for this?\n02:36 Our first solo via ferrata\n08:36 We love Public Lands!\n09:59 Overnight in the mountain hut\n14:20 Emotional morning of the climb\n16:54 HERE WE GO\n20:48 THE LADDER\n29:52 BLOOPS","title":"WE CLIMBED THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS LADDER (2,000 Foot Drop)","duration":1858,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20221112","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cw2zzop8-A","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2Cw2zzop8-A/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":907243}}
