{"description":"The death toll from the wildfires in Maui now stands at 80, and about a thousand people remain missing. The fire is now mostly contained and some survivors are returning to find their community in ruins. Global’s Neetu Garcha is in Maui and has been speaking with evacuees including a Canadian school principal.\n\nResidents say the wildfires hit without warning and some are now demanding to know why their large seaside community was caught off guard. As Reggie Cecchini explains, experts say this fire offers lessons for the future. \n\nAt least six asylum seekers have been killed after their boat sank in the English Channel. It’s the latest in a string of similar tragedies. More than 1,000 migrants have tried to make the journey to the UK by boat in just the last two days. As Touria Izri reports, those who survived the journey, face tough, new immigration measures.\n\nWith no end in sight to the war in Ukraine, tensions are rising in neighbouring Poland – particularly along its border with Belarus. The Polish government claims Belarussian military helicopters entered its airspace at the beginning of the month. In response, Poland’s government ordered 10,000 troops to the border to bolster defences – while on the other side, mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner group are reportedly training Belarussian forces. Those military maneuvers are making NATO nations nervous. Tonight, Crystal Goomansingh looks at the work underway to keep Poland safe.\n\nArtificial Intelligence just might join you on your next vacation. Tourism Jasper in Alberta’s rocky mountains is now using AI in hopes of making the destination more popular. And they’re not alone- as Heather Yourex-West explains, applications like ChatGPT and Oliver A.I. are taking the industry by storm.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/national/program/global-national\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #globalnational","title":"Global National: Aug. 12, 2023 | How Maui was caught off guard by catastrophic wildfires","duration":1224,"channel_id":"UChLtXXpo4Ge1ReTEboVvTDg","author":"Global News","date":"20230813","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uvpq0jkgA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/U2Uvpq0jkgA/hqdefault.webp?v=64d82cc3","content":{"View count":564779}}

This arose in a discussion about Kodak Black, who was given a Rolls-Royce Phantom for contributing a verse to a song. When Vlad questioned the wisdom of owning multiple cars, Boosie defended the practice claiming they are an investment and a source of additional income if needed. In support of this practice, Boosie referred to a period when he was incarcerated and paid his bond by selling one of his cars. Vlad echoed Boosie’s sentiment, adding that smart financial habits can only be learned through experience. Both agreed that material possessions are not worth as much as personal freedom and should not be viewed as a permanent asset.","title":"Boosie on Kodak Black Clowning Him for Selling Rolls Royce to Pay for Legal Fees (Part 10)","duration":287,"channel_id":"UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","author":"djvlad","date":"20230811","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWYD9av1XcY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dWYD9av1XcY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":735116}}

As Tommy leaves New York after losing Ghost, LaKeisha and the only city he's ever known, he makes a quick detour to close an old wound that’s been haunting him for decades. What was supposed to be a quick stop turns into a labyrinth of family secrets and lies Tommy thought were long buried.  One step leads to another and Tommy quickly finds himself in Chicago's drug game, inserting himself between the city's two biggest crews. In a city divided by race, Tommy straddles the line, ultimately becoming the lynchpin that not only unites them - but holds the POWER to watch them crumble. As the first season unfolds at breakneck speed, Tommy uses his outsider status to his advantage, breaking all the local rules and rewriting them on his quest to become the biggest drug dealer in Chicago.v","title":"Power Book IV: Force | Official Trailer | Season 2","duration":119,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230810","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02K63ZxlZo4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/02K63ZxlZo4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":5345544}}

{"description":"Bobby Carter | August 8, 2023\nThere are times during Action Bronson's Tiny Desk when his vocals momentarily drift. We instruct our guests to face the directional microphones so that our recorders clearly pick up the voices. Action warned us of the improbability of that happening before we started filming and sure enough, the Flushing, Queens emcee strolled off mic a couple of times, did an about face here and there and even took a knee mid-show. By the time we got to \"Latin Grammys,\" he looked over to our engineer Josh Rogosin and said, \"I told you I couldn't stand still. How do you play music still?\" He's got a point.\n\nAction's band Human Growth Hormone reinterprets his records so funky, it's nearly impossible not to move, yet the small imperfections during the set tickled me. Bam Bam, primarily known as a rapper, has turned his passion for food, clothing, sneakers, wrestling, writing, fitness and painting into bonafide professions. Never veering too far away from the booth, he's consistently dropped projects since 2011. After working out in the green room, Mr. Baklava walked to the Desk, greeting nearly every person in the room with a handshake, and proceeded to perform highlights from Mr. Wonderful, Lamb Over Rice, White Bronco, and Only For Dolphins. Bronson was born to entertain us.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Dmtri\"\n\"Live from the Moon\"\n\"Latin Grammys\"\n\"Terry\"\n\"Baby Blue\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAction Bronson: vocals, effects\nMatt \"Yung Mehico\" Carrillo: keys, saxophone\nNicholas Coleman: bass\nWahkiba \"9Ether\" Julion: drums\nRed Walrus: percussion\nJulian Love: guitar\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #actionbronson","title":"Action Bronson: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1673,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230808","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUN8pdgA0m8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CUN8pdgA0m8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1606651}}
