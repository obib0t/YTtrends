{"description":"Jason Cammisa got the exclusive first test, strapped on his equipment, and broke the record: the Lucid Air Sapphire is the world's quickest-accelerating production car.\n\nWith a staggering quarter-mile performance of 9.1 seconds at 156 mph, this 1200+ horsepower 3-motor Air beat out the reigning champion, the triple-motor, 1020-hp Tesla Model S Plaid, which runs the 1/4-mile in 9.3 seconds at 152 mph.\n\nThe cars are \"tied\" at 2.1 seconds 0-60, though some trivia: the Lucid Air Sapphire gets to 60 mph 0.03 seconds before the Tesla Model S Plaid.\n\nWe weren't satisfied with just that race, so we also brought along the fastest-accelerating gas-powered production car, the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport. This is the 1479-hp (1500-PS) Chiron with shortened gear ratios, grippy Michelin Cup 2R tires, a fixed rear wing, and weight-reduction measures. \n\nEven despite these hyper-aggressive Michelins' distaste for cold tarmac, the Chiron ripped off a 2.3-second, four-wheel-burnout launch from 0-to-60 mph, and then continued on to a 9.3-second, 156-mph quarter-mile performance. That is a tenth quicker to 60 mph than the \"regular\" Chiron has managed, and a tenth quicker through the quarter, too. That's an internal-combustion production-car 1/4-mile record for the Chiron Pur Sport — and we suspect that, in warmer conditions, this Pur Sport would be even quicker! \n\nThat's not the case with the 210-hp Ducati Panigale V4 SP2, one of the quickest superbikes in the world. It had no traction issues as MotoAmerica Supersport champion rider Josh Herrin cracked the throttle wide open, dumped the dry clutch, and ripped off a stupefying 9.3-second, 157-mph run through the quarter-mile.\n\nThis beat our last outing with the same Panigale, when it handily dusted a 2023 C8 Corvette Z06. This time, Ducati softened the suspension and dropped the fork; Josh sacrificed the clutch and kept the wheelie at bay. It's safe to say this is the limit for the SP2 — except that Ducati offers a factory Akrapovic exhaust and tune that boost horsepower. We'd love to come back and try that again!\n\nBut for the moment, it's clear: among production cars with four wheels, the Lucid Air Sapphire is now the acceleration king, with the Chiron Pur Sport in second place. In one video, Tesla went from first to third.\n\nMay the fight continue.\n\nThis episode of Ultimate Drag Race Replay is brought to you by WeatherTech: https://www.weathertech.com/?utm_source=hagerty&utm_medium=web_visit&utm_campaign=Ultimate_Drag_Race_Replay\n\n\n===\n\n0:00 Introducing Lucid Air Sapphire, Tesla Model S Plaid, Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport, and the Ducati Panigale V4 SP2\n0:56 German 155-mph Autobahn Gentleman's Agreement - within 1/4 mile\n1:29 Tesla Model S Plaid vs E39 M5\n2:04 Lucid Air Sapphire Prototype\n2:30 Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport\n3:13 Main Event: Drag Race Sapphire vs Plaid vs Chiron!\n3:55 Walkback: Sapphire Drag Race explanation\n4:18 Why is Sapphire so much quicker than Air Dream Edition?\n5:05 Tesla Plaid in Last Place\n5:49 Bugatti Chiron Launch Control is violent\n6:00 EV vs ICE traction control: The 1000-Hz advantage\n7:07 Josh Herrin in the Ducati Panigale V4 SP2\n7:35 Bonus Race: Ducati Panigale V4 SP2 vs Lucid Air Sapphire\n8:24 The Ducati's quarter-mile-long wheelie\n9:03 Overall Drag Race Results — Rimac & Bugatti join forces\n\n==\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

{"description":"Welcome to what could be our most exciting review EVER! \n\nMat’s got his hands on the McMurtry Spéirling, and he’s about to find out if it can back up its claim of being the quickest accelerating road car ever made! \n\nNow before he even gets behind the wheel, you need to know that the McMurtry comes with a reputation! It's claimed the record as being the fastest car to complete the Goodwood Festival of Speed Hillclimb - beating an F1 car to the title by two whole seconds!\n\nBut what makes this lightning-fast single-seater so special? Well, it comes with an incredible fan system that helps to generate 2,000kg of downforce! This means the McMurtry is not only super quick off the line, but it can take corners at speed with ease. \n\nIn terms of power output, it has two electric motors that produce 1,000hp. Now you may not think that’s too impressive, given EVs such as the Rimac Nevera come with almost 2,000hp. However, whereas the Nevera weighs over 2 tonnes, the McMurtry Spéirling weighs less than one tonne!! \n\nNow, of course, all that power and performance doesn’t come cheap, costing just under £2,000,000. But if the car can break records as it claims, then it’s got to be worth it, right? \n\nAll we know is, this is one review you don’t want to miss! Will Mat go faster than he’s ever been before?

{"description":"France and Morocco faced off in the semifinals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. France was looking to advance to the final for the second straight World Cup and Morocco was striving to become the first African nation to make a World Cup final. France got started early as a Kylian Mbappé shot on goal was rebounded by Theo Hernández who scored. Morocco almost tied it up when Jawad El Yamiq's bicycle kick ALMOST goes in but France's Hugo Lloris denied it. The second half was slow but France would get on the board again after Randal Kolo Muani scored in 79’. France would win 2-0 and advance to the final for the second World Cup in a row.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #France #Morocco \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

Rich and Jay are joined by DC Comics artist Freddie Williams to talk about the 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film! Freddie has drawn Ninja Turtles comics and Rich has read many Ninja Turtles comics, so they're the perfect duo to explain all this nonsense to Jay, who just liked to see the silly rat say \"Cowabunga\" at the end of the film when he was 10 years old.","title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) - re:View","duration":2864,"channel_id":"UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA","author":"RedLetterMedia","date":"20221213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZZbXDA3uRQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZZbXDA3uRQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":786412}}

When we think of an exotic state of matter we tend to think of the really weird things that matter can do in extreme circumstances - like how at very high temperatures we get the plasma that the sun is made of, or at extreme densities we get the nuclear matter of neutron stars. But there’s one state of matter - supercritical fluid -  that’s not solid, liquid or gas, but is also not confined to extreme or rare environments. In fact, there are planets in our solar system completely covered with oceans of the stuff, and you’ve often been the beneficiary of its powers without even knowing it. \n\nSpecial Thanks to Nigel Braun.

{"description":"All Money made from this video will be donated to Make-A-Wish: https://wish.org/\nSo many kids are going through a lot worse stuff than I am and Make-a-Wish does a really great job in making their dreams come true and creating positive memories.\n\nFor the last year and a half I have not been able to be physical, jump around, or do much martial arts in my videos,. This video explains why. The biggest of the eight tumors is near my tailbone and it causes a lot of pain whenever I'm standing or walking. If I try running or doing a jump it feels like a knife is being stabbed deep into my tailbone. Sitting or standing for more than 10 minutes also causes a lot of nerve pain shooting from my glutes, all the way down my hamstrings and into my calves. \n\nDuring the last year, we incorrectly worked under the diagnosis I had only a cyst in my tailbone. We tried five different smaller medical procedures (injections: epidurals, caudals). I also saw many different physical therapists three times per week over the course of eight months. After none of this was affective, we went to THE tailbone cyst expert down in Dallas, TX. He looked at the MRI scans and right away said \"That is not a cyst.\" I then saw other experts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and another in Dallas. \n\nAt USC Medical in Los Angeles we learned I had a total of eight tumors. The surgeon performed a spinal tap (not fun) to see if we could learn more about what these mysterious growths were. The results were inconclusive and now the last thing to do is to remove one of the tumors, do a biopsy on it, and learn exactly what is going on. We hope by removing the largest tumor that I'll have some pain relief as well.:","title":"I Have 8 Tumors","duration":408,"channel_id":"UCwaNuezahYT3BOjfXsne2mg","author":"Chad Wild Clay","date":"20221210","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbCAu5t25m8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SbCAu5t25m8/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1722229}}

OH another cool tune i used is a SNES super mario styled remix of MF DOOM- Rapp Snitch Knishes. it was so awesome and so funny and i love DOOM so i thought itd be perfect to use.  ALSO! in the middle of the video i used an instrumental of Tyler, The Creator's- DOMO23 from the Wolf album. another classic from an album i love, the horn sections especially go so hard. \nbut yeah all in all i LOVED making this vid. something about the rawness of me and the boys coming together and stomping on the minecraft community had a fun vibe to it.

{"description":"Back in July when I officially became sponsorless, I started thinking about exactly the bike I wanted for the first time in years. I knew I wanted a titanium hardtail, but nobody made the exact geometry I really preferred. The reach was always too long, or the size small had some bend in the seat tube that would prevent my dropper post from being inserted the whole way.\n\nThat’s when I realized that “zero-compromise” would mean having a custom frame built. So I started my conversation with Sage, who makes built to order titanium frames out of Oregon.  Not only did I get the exact geometry that I wanted, but also a custom paint job. I was against painting the titanium at all from the start, but they won me over with a custom Cerakote scheme that covers only the rear of the bike. \n\nI also picked out all the parts for this bike. Some companies I had contacts at, and I was able to get a discount or even a free part. But back when I started my orders, many companies were fresh out of stock, and so I needed to pay full retail sideways to get the parts in time. Had I compromised and taken parts that were available, or parts I could get for free, it would have been just that—a compromise. \n\nNow that the bike is finished, I’m really wondering how it rides! I took it down a dirt road while lugging around a bunch of cameras to get the finished shots, and then promptly got sick. Next week I’ll ride the bike in all sorts of different conditions, and then go into more detail about the geometry!\n\nBlue Ridge Jerseys & Berm Peak Merch https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nSage Titanium https://sagetitanium.com/\nCustom knives https://www.instagram.com/oegedc\n\nThe Main Parts\nBerd Hawk 27 Wheels https://berdspokes.com/products/berd-hawk27-carbon-wheels\nFox 34 Factory https://amzn.to/3FfRk25\nCane Creek eeWings https://amzn.to/3iVknAr\nOneUp Carbon Bars https://amzn.to/3PoPr7Z\nTRP Evo Trail Brakes https://trpcycling.com/product/trail-evo/\nSram AXS XX1 Upgrade kit https://bit.ly/3VPc08n\nSram XX1 Cassette https://bit.ly/3FEfPHM\nOneUp EDC https://amzn.to/3iRnWIa\nOneUp Threadless Carrier https://amzn.to/3YaRcd0\nMaxxis Minion DHF https://amzn.to/3uKh8OU\nMaxxis Rekon https://amzn.to/3Yoho42\nRev Grips https://revgrips.com/collections/pro-series-grip-system/products/pro-series-ergonomic-grip-system\n\nBerm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts\nhttps://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nCheck out our second channel for more of the same https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpP5PqrzODWpFU961acUbg\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nMusic in this video is from \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg\n\nJoin my Patreon and 100% of the proceeds go towards projects in the mountain biking community.
