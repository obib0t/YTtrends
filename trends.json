{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to the final installment of our Nordic/Scandinavian trip - the Glass Igloos in Finland! So far on our trip, we have taken a communal hot bath at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland, nearly cryogenically frozen ourselves at the ICEHOTEL in Sweden, and now we're on to Arctic Finland to stay in a glass igloo under the northern lights!\n\nFor years, I've been seeing the glass igloos in Finland on my instagram, tiktok - **and YouTube shorts** feeds - and I've always wanted to try them out. I've never seen the northern lights before, and I've also never stayed in a human-sized terrarium before, but I've always been intrigued by those see-through bubble tents - so we decided to go and try one out and see if we freeze our butts off! And while at Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort, home of the glass igloos, we also tried a bunch of arctic activities - like snowmobiling, reindeer sleigh rides, dog sledding, and traditional Finnish sauna-ing and ice bathing!! \n\nWhat do you think??

{"description":"Today‚Äôs In a Nutshell will be on Roblox King Legacy, a Roblox RPG game based on the anime One Piece. The game is very similar to Blox Fruits and is the second most popular One Piece game on Roblox. So what that means is yeah... most of this video is going to be a shetpost. \n\nKing Legacy is a generic Roblox roleplaying game (RPG) where players complete quests, level up and get more powerful gears. Currently, there is the First and Second Sea. NPCs in the Second Sea are stronger, and the player needs to be at least level 2250 to enter. The levelling is almost the same as Blox Fruits, where each island has a few NPC giving out quests, and completing them will level you up. The current max level is 4000, so you can go from noob to pro in a day or two if you are dedicated. Using codes will help you level faster. \n\nThere are 3 types of attacks for combat: fruit, melee and sword. Each type of attack has different abilities, and their damage depends on your stats. \n\nFruits are obtained by scavenging, rolling from gacha or buying from the black market. Fruits spawn every 1 or 2 hours and you can roll for them 5 times every 6 hours. The black market restocks every hour but fruits there are randomized. There is no definite tier list of which fruit is the best. The best fruit depends on your combo and how it synergizes with other abilities. Certain fruits are good for grinding, while others are good for PvP. The good fruits are Dragon, Dough, Light, Magma, Gravity, Dark and Venom. \n\nFor melee, there are currently 5 fighting styles: Black Leg, Cyborg, Real Water Style (Fishman Karate), Dragon Claw and Electro. All except Fishman Karate can be upgraded to V2 for more damage and cooler effects. \n\nSwords have 2 abilities, and they are obtained by killing bosses or by purchasing. Sword can be upgraded at the blacksmith. The normal upgrade gives more damage, and the enchantment gives special effects. \n\nLike Blox Fruits, there are special abilities like Busoshoku Haki, Kenbunshoku Haki, Soru,  Geppo and Haoshoku Haki (Conqueror's haki). Buso Haki makes you black and deals more damage on non-fruit attacks. Ken Haki gives ESP and auto-dodge. Soru lets you teleport a short distance, Geppo lets you jump in the air, and Conqueror‚Äôs Haki stuns lower-level people around you.\n\nSo yeah, just like all the other Roblox In A Nutshell videos, I will attempt to show everything Roblox King Legacy has to offer: abilities, fruits, fighting styles, swords, guns, races, accessories, stats, combat, and grinding. Some people speculate that guns will be added in the next update and that would be hilarious cuz it would just be like Blox Fruits.  And like always, this Roblox video is filled with a crapload of dumb jokes and dead memes and takes the form of a funny moments/funny montage/edit. Hit the like and the subscribe button if you enjoyed this video, click the bell icon and don't forget to comment in the comment section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis video contains a crap load of dead memes and bad jokes.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet¬≠to¬≠be¬≠dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.","title":"Roblox BÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂lÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂oÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂xÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂ Ã∂Ã∑Ã∂FÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂rÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂uÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂iÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂tÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂sÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂ King Legacy In A Nutshell V3","duration":857,"channel_id":"UCH6sNLmH-rsATLffdpGYscQ","author":"Tank Fish","date":"20230527","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoPzGJ9RGpY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JoPzGJ9RGpY/hqdefault.webp?v=647122be","content":{"View count":512375}}

{"description":"As was reported might be the case, it turns out that the first day after chemo is pretty OK, but then it gets progressively worse until day 5 or 6. I'm now on day 7 and feeling OK. I've had many (but not all!) of the expected side effects, but my appetite has been good, which is very good for the quality of life! Glad to be through the worst of the first treatment, but obviously I've still got a long way to go. I wouldn't want everyone to think that Day 7 is indicative of how you feel while you're doing chemo...if you had seen me on Day 3 I would have been 100% horizontal. \n\nI hear it tends to get a little worse every time (though I've got some tips for how to maybe make a few things hit a little less hard!)

Hollywood paints it as a time of gunslingers, adventure, and cowboy heroes, but as often is the case, the reality is a bit more lackluster. While it was a rather violent place with high murder rates, this can be misleading as even one murder in a small population size can produce seemingly astronomical murder rates, essentially enhancing outliers in data. The truth is, the \"Wild West\" was a rather calm and boring time where people were much more focused on getting to the next day than robbing trains or saving damsels in distress. But while the dangers painted by Hollywood and dime novels are often over exaggerated and glamorized, that doesn't mean the region and time period was void of danger! So join me back in time to learn about the real history and dangers of the American Wild West!\n\nTitle: Brett Van Donsel ‚Äì Rattlesnake Railroad\nArtist: Brett Van Donsel\nSource: http://soundcloud.com/brett-van-donse...\nLicense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWild West by ZitronSound http://bit.ly/2nXGy9W\nCreative Commons ‚Äî CC BY-ND 3.0 https://goo.gl/QHshNa","title":"How to Survive the Wild West","duration":1410,"channel_id":"UCvQ4C0f9_OWRf1uyobwqOwA","author":"BlueJay","date":"20230526","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLWZBXBOBs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxLWZBXBOBs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":409270}}

{"description":"Are YOU ready? THE FLASH - Only in Theaters June 16. #TheFlashMovie\n\nText 239-932-7332 to join the DC Community.\n https://my.community.com/dc\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù directed by Andy Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero‚Äôs first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in ‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian‚Ä¶ albeit not the one he‚Äôs looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry‚Äôs only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe?\n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (‚ÄúBullet Train,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äù), Ron Livingston (‚ÄúLoudermilk,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù), Maribel Verd√∫ (‚ÄúElite,‚Äù ‚ÄúY tu mam√° tambi√©n‚Äù), Kiersey Clemons (‚ÄúZack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League,‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetheart‚Äù), Antje Traue (‚ÄúKing of Ravens,‚Äù ‚ÄúMan of Steel‚Äù) and Michael Keaton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù) and Michael Disco (‚ÄúRampage,‚Äù ‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (‚ÄúBirds of Prey,‚Äù ‚ÄúBumblebee‚Äù), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (‚ÄúDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming‚Äù) and Joby Harold (‚ÄúTransformers: Rise of the Beasts,‚Äù ‚ÄúArmy of the Dead‚Äù), based on characters from DC. The executive producers are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Suicide Squad‚Äù), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (‚ÄúIT Chapter Two,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù), editors Jason Ballantine (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù) and Paul Machliss (‚ÄúThe Gentlemen,‚Äù ‚ÄúBaby Driver‚Äù), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (‚ÄúDoctor Strange,‚Äù ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äù); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch (‚ÄúThe Invisible Man,‚Äù the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films).\n\nWarner Bros.

{"description":"The in-depth story of the Lake Erie Skydiving Disaster 1967. \nTwenty skydivers eagerly board a World War Two Bomber plane for a complimentary high-altitude jump. Little do they know it would turn into the deadliest disaster in the history of recreational skydiving. As the plane ascends, they prepare for the exhilarating jump. But then, the weather worsens, and a thick layer of clouds engulfs the sky. Despite the golden rule of skydiving - \"don't jump if you can't see the target\" - the thrill-seekers leap into the abyss below, and sixteen fall to their deaths in the cold waters of Lake Erie in Ohio.\n\nSubscribe for more fascinating disaster documentaries: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb6yg8d7eoZF6vnL4e8mog?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTragic history playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtCh3_Fxp9FtVfTqXA06J3jhoxIFjpaF\n\nSuggest a topic for my next video: https://bit.ly/DarkRecordsTopics\n\nFootage used under fair-use.

As Tommy leaves New York after losing Ghost, LaKeisha and the only city he's ever known, he makes a quick detour to close an old wound that‚Äôs been haunting him for decades. What was supposed to be a quick stop turns into a labyrinth of family secrets and lies Tommy thought were long buried.  One step leads to another and Tommy quickly finds himself in Chicago's drug game, inserting himself between the city's two biggest crews. In a city divided by race, Tommy straddles the line, ultimately becoming the lynchpin that not only unites them - but holds the POWER to watch them crumble. As the first season unfolds at breakneck speed, Tommy uses his outsider status to his advantage, breaking all the local rules and rewriting them on his quest to become the biggest drug dealer in Chicago.","title":"Power Book IV: Force | Official Teaser | Season 2","duration":35,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230522","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knFMIPwzP0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_knFMIPwzP0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":547922}}
