{"description":"Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton’s best weekend of 2023 ended in the worst possible outcome. Their strongest challenge against Red Bull and Max Verstappen yet ended in a disqualification for a rare breach of a near-30-year-old rule - with Ferrari falling foul of this as well. \nRed Bull was checked, hadn’t made the same mistake - and therefore Verstappen’s victory stood. Conversely Hamilton was stripped of his second place at the United States GP just a few hours after chasing Verstappen closely in his upgraded Mercedes in easily his and the team’s most competitive showing of the season, while Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc got excluded from sixth place at the same time. \nTheir cars breached the same technical regulation that refers to the thickness of the plank assembly under the car, with a minimum thickness of 9mm accepted after a competitive session due to wear.\nIt put a dampener on a much improved weekend for Mercedes even if there were a few factors behind dominant world champion Verstappen almost suffering a rare defeat. \n\n00:00 Exclusions\n01:57 How Ferrari and Mercedes got caught out\n03:26 Why only four cars were checked\n05:28 How Red Bull avoided trouble\n07:55 What about Mercedes' upgrade?\n\nSubscribe: http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribe\nWebsite: http://the-race.com/\nTwitter: @wearetherace\nInstagram: @wearetherace\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/wearetherace\nPodcasts: http://the-race.com/podcasts\n\nThanks for watching - please like, share and comment, please also hit subscribe to show your support so we'll keep doing what we're doing.\n\nhttps://www.the-race.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/wearetherace\n\n#f1 #f1news #USGP #f12023 #mercedes #ferrari #redbull #lewishamilton #charlesleclerc #maxverstappen #hamilton #leclerc #verstappen #fia #rules #excluded #disqualified #disqualification #austin #texas #formula1 #formulaone #grandprix #therace","title":"How Red Bull avoided USGP error that got Hamilton and Leclerc excluded","duration":605,"channel_id":"UCaTxfj0BzL-MaCy-YUqPRoQ","author":"THE RACE","date":"20231023","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBAhkdSsVOQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wBAhkdSsVOQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGBMgVSh_MA8=&rs=AOn4CLBEu3Wzc6A1P1CsTlPTT3Y51Zv9gw","content":{"View count":456589}}

{"description":"Could we buy some land and build a tiny home? Get healthy - go to http://drinkAG1.com/kingingit \n\nLast week we started the hunt for the house of our dreams. We had initially thought we wanted a home already built for us to renovate.  But since viewing properties for sale in the highlands but not finding exactly what we were looking for, we thought it would be worth exploring a selection of different builds. \nWe asked ourselves, could we buy land? Could we build our own house? Then we met friends who owned a campsite and wondered what owning that would look like?\nThis week we head to West wales to view two more amazing properties and visit  @CampOutWest   - couple Emilie and Jon that are hoping to build their campground with a veg patch and live sustainably and live off grid. We see if building a campsite/ tiny home/ air bnb/ glamping site might be an option.\n\nWALES Google Maps - https://www.kinging-it.com/maps\n\n🚗 Top 10 videos to watch on Kinging-it’s channel:\nWATCH HERE! - http://bit.ly/3uHC5sy\n\n➡️👫 A bit about US- \nWe are Craig and Aimee, from South Wales, UK.

{"description":"We came back from two goals behind to maintain our unbeaten start to the season as strikes from Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard earned a point at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe hosts found themselves in firm control when Cole Palmer converted a penalty 14 minutes into proceedings, and then just after the restart Mykhailo Mudryk caught us napping with a cheeky effort to double his team’s lead.\n\nBut a spark of inspiration for ourselves came in the form of a 30-yard first-time effort from Rice with 13 minutes remaining, and then Trossard converted a wicked Bukayo Saka delivery on 83 minutes to complete the comeback.\n\nThe hosts started in the ascendancy and would have the better of the game in the opening 45 minutes, but they were handed an opportunity to make their early pressure pay when they were awarded a VAR-assisted penalty on 14 minutes. \n\nRaheem Sterling’s cross aimed for Mudryk saw the Ukrainian miss his header and the ball struck the arm of William Saliba challenging him in the air. After a lengthy period of play, Chris Kavanagh was sent to the pitchside monitor and opted to point to the spot, allowing Palmer to send David Raya the wrong way from 12 yards and net against us for the second time this season, following his strike for Manchester City in the Community Shield.\n\nWe continued to struggle to impose ourselves on the game and Palmer came close to adding to that tally on the half-hour mark when he linked up with Mudryk and flashed a shot through Saliba’s legs and saw it fizz just wide of the far upright.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half, our chances of remaining unbeaten at the end of the 90 minutes began to vanish even further after a little bit of magic from our opponents. Little looked on when Connor Gallagher found Mudryk on the left flank, but the winger crept towards the box, looked up and clipped a cross-cum-shot over Raya and into the net.\n\nThat prompted a response from Arteta’s team, and Bukayo Saka nearly found the net in fortunate circumstances when he slipped taking a corner and Robert Sanchez had to tip a swerving delivery over his bar, and from the resulting flag kick Gabriel headed wide.\n\nBut just after that, we were lucky not to fall further behind when Palmer pounced on a Raya mistake to round the keeper but the Spaniard did well to get his hands to his shot to only concede a corner.\n\nWe were desperate for a little spark or piece of luck to get back into the game, and on 77 minutes it arrived. Sanchez tried to play his way out from the back but his pass was too weak, and Rice raced past his marker to intercept and curl a first-time effort into the unguarded net to register his second goal in our colours.\n\nThat was an excellent strike, and just six minutes later, we managed to score another, albeit in a different fashion. Saka received possession on the right and whipped a delicious cross towards the back post for Trossard, who got a touch on it to send it past Sanchez and send the travelling support wild.\n\nThey were nearly celebrating again once again minutes later when Eddie Nketiah raced onto a long ball forward, managed to get past Thiago Silva and struck towards goal but saw his effort go agonisingly wide of the mark, as we had to settle for a draw.\n\nTrossard is the first player ever to score his first three Premier League goals for us all as a substitute.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice #trossard \n\n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.
