{"description":"Two-division world champion Danny “Swift Garcia dominated in his super welterweight debut Saturday night, cruising to a majority decision victory over exciting contender Jose Benavidez Jr. in the SHOWTIME main event from Barclays Center in Brooklyn headlining a Premier Boxing Champions event. He saved perhaps his most expressive moment post-fight when he broke down in the ring discussing his struggles with mental health with SHOWTIME reporter Jim Gray, showing the authenticity that has made him such a fan-favorite in Brooklyn. \n \n“I did take a break going through mental things, things went dark, I went through anxiety, deep depression, just trying to be strong,” said a visibly emotional Garcia. “It was the pressure of life, being a good dad, just letting it out right now, because it was all stuck inside. It rained on me for a year and a half and the only way to do better was to fight again. I’m a fighter. If you battle anxiety and depression, you can get out of it, that’s what I did today. I fought.”\n \nPhiladelphia’s Garcia (37-3, 21 KOs) has become a staple at Barclays Center ever since headlining the arena’s first boxing event in 2012, and his return on Saturday night against Benavidez (27-2-1, 18 KOs), saw him pick up his seventh victory in Brooklyn.\n\n#DannyGarcia #JoseBenavidez #GarciaBenavidez\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Garcia vs Benavidez HIGHLIGHTS: July 30, 2022 | PBC on Showtime","duration":84,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20220731","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1vtJsi8KY8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G1vtJsi8KY8/hqdefault.jpg?v=62e7faf4","content":{"View count":562039}}

{"description":"We finished our pre-season campaign in fine style by thrashing Sevilla 6-0 to claim the Emirates Cup, with Gabriel Jesus making an instant impression on his new supporters by grabbing a hat-trick.\n\nA capacity crowd were treated to four goals in the opening 20 minutes, courtesy of braces from Bukayo Saka and Jesus, with the Brazilian striker completing his treble on 77 minutes before Eddie Nketiah got in on the act in the final minute.\n\nThe performance, clinical finishing and clean sheet ensured it was a wonderful afternoon’s work for Mikel Arteta’s men, who look well-prepared for the Premier League starting in six days’ time.\n\nThe atmosphere was buoyant at Emirates Stadium before kick-off, which only increased during the opening 20 minutes as we ran riot and found the net four times to stun our opponents.\n\nThe scoring began in the 10th minute when Martin Odegaard clipped a ball over the top for Saka to chase, who was inexplicably pushed over by Karim Rekik, leaving referee Andy Madley no option but to award a penalty, which Saka stroked home.\n\nThe lead was swiftly doubled two minutes later when Ben White’s crossfield pass picked out Jesus on the left touchline, who then found Granit Xhaka. After edging his way into the box, his low cross was parried by Bono into the path of the onrushing Jesus, who had the simple task of tucking the chance away.\n\nAnd after giving the majority of supporters their first glimpse of his famous telephone celebration in Arsenal colours, he was at it again two minutes later. Again the threat came down the left but this time through Gabriel Martinelli, and with the Sevilla defence sleeping, a teasing cross allowed Jesus to race in behind and dispatch the delivery into the net.\n\nSevilla had completely lost their heads, and that was typified by our fourth goal. A routine pass back to Bono saw the goalkeeper fluff a weak clearance straight to Saka, whose first-time effort trickled through the shot-stopper’s legs to cap off an incredible start.\n\nGlee was spreading around the stadium, and none more so than on the pitch, with Arteta’s team producing plenty of slick passing and looking threatening every time they entered the final third.\n\nDuring a couple of rare forays forward for the visitors in the first half, Youssef En-Nesyri flashed a shot just wide before heading straight at Aaron Ramsdale - a feat Thomas Partey repeated following a corner, before a remarkable half ended with Bono clawing back some redemption by making a double save to deny both Jesus and Odegaard, and then denying Martinelli one-on-one.\n\nIt was a much tighter affair immediately after the break, with Rekik heading a corner just wide 10 minutes after the restart, but we were working through the gears again and after Jesus dragged an attempt from 25 yards wide, Oleksandr Zinchenko picked out Odegaard in the box but he blasted over.\n\nMidway through the second half there was almost a delightful goal to cheer when Partey chipped a ball over the backline for Xhaka, and his side-footed volley narrowly missed the top corner, but on 77 minutes the long wait for another goal ended.\n\nA Martinelli corner caused havoc as Gabriel forced Bono into a close-range save, but Jesus was on hand to drive home the rebound, complete his treble and register his seventh goal in just five pre-season outings.\n\nWhite almost put the cap on the result when a clever free-kick routine saw him attempt to lob Bono but it drifted wide, but in the final minute a sixth was added when Xhaka showed good skill to play in Martinelli, and after carrying the ball 40 yards the Brazilian unselfishly squared to Nketiah to complete the rout.\n\nThe final whistle was greeted with rapturous applause by those in attendance, who stayed to watch Odegaard get his hands on the Emirates Cup trophy to mark our sixth triumph in the competition’s history.\n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Jesus, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Nikita Parris, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White, Thomas Partey and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok","title":"HIGHLIGHTS | Arsenal vs Sevilla (6-0) | Gabriel Jesus scores a hat-trick on Emirates Stadium debut!","duration":334,"channel_id":"UCpryVRk_VDudG8SHXgWcG0w","author":"Arsenal","date":"20220731","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edAcHy1_95w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/edAcHy1_95w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2343937}}

Karim Benzema then stepped up to tuck home a penalty and make it 1-0, who was later followed by Marco Asensio in the second half after a magnificent team play led by Eden Hazard.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.

It got awkward, and it got beefy.\n\nDirected and edited by Ryan Simmons\nWritten and produced by Seth Rosenthal\n\nSubscribe: http://goo.gl/Nbabae \nEnter the Secret Base: http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base \nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/secretbase \nFollow us on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/secretbasesbn \nFollow us on Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@secretbasesbn? \nCheck out our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/9pMHRV \nVisit our playlists: http://goo.gl/NvpZFF \nExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com","title":"The Doc Rivers-Bill Simmons beef is what happens when the media are fans","duration":1018,"channel_id":"UCDRmGMSgrtZkOsh_NQl4_xw","author":"Secret Base","date":"20220730","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4C8JXCCak4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R4C8JXCCak4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":338776}}

I'm 27 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here.

{"description":"California's \"train to nowhere\" shows the challenges ahead.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn 2008, voters in California passed Proposition 1A, giving the state the go-ahead to build a high-speed rail line. In theory, it was a great idea. The train would whisk passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than 3 hours. Eventually it would also link San Diego and Sacramento. It was estimated that it would take until 2020 to complete. \n\nBut now it’s 2022, and so far California’s high-speed rail line is just a few concrete bridges and viaducts strewn across the rural Central Valley. Much of the plan had to be changed, redesigned, or even abandoned all together. Now the project is decades late and way over budget. And that isn’t just California’s problem. Because among the many factors that plagued the project, several are baked into the power structure of the US itself.\n\nWatch the video above to understand just how difficult the US makes it to build infrastructure like California’s high-speed rail line. \n\nChapters:\nCalifornia’s plan: 00:00\nLocal control: 1:48\nFederal funding: 3:45\nLawsuits: 5:09\nThe experience gap: 6:37\n\nFurther reading and sources: \n\nYou can find more of Ethan Elkind’s high-speed rail research and analysis here:\nhttps://www.ethanelkind.com/category/high-speed-rail/\n\nAnd we highly recommend reading Ralph Vartabedian and Tim Sheehan’s reporting to learn more about how this project has affected communities on the ground: \nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-29/california-bullet-train-impacts-disadvantaged-communities-san-joaquin-valley\nhttps://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/high-speed-rail/article260855207.html \n\nThe California-High Speed Rail Authority’s 2022 business plan was a key source for mapping the routes in this video: \nhttps://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Business-Plan-FINAL-A11Y.pdf\n\nOlder business plans, like this one from 2005, helped us understand which alternate routes were being considered before the 2008 vote:\nhttps://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/programs/eir-eis/State_Wide_EIR_EIS_Volume_1_Part_1_of_3.pdf\n\nThis is the 2015 CEQA lawsuit report we refer to in the video: \nhttps://issuu.com/hollandknight/docs/ceqa_litigation_abuseissuu?e=16627326/14197714 \n\nOverall infrastructure spending in the US is an important part of this story, and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation had a lot of helpful resources. The video uses data from this report in charts on state and federal spending: https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/06/state-and-local-infrastructure-spending-a-closer-look\n\nExactly how much the federal government ended up spending on this project and when can be hard to pin down, but funding agreement documents like the ones below are publicly available and very useful: \nhttps://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/about/funding_finance/funding_agreements/HSRFRA_CooperativeGrantAgreement_Amendment6_051816_Redacted.pdf\nhttps://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/about/funding_finance/funding_agreements/Executed_FY10_Amendment_1.pdf \n\nWe also found this funding timeline from the Eno Center for Transportation extremely helpful in understanding the funding and cost projections related to CAHSR:\nhttps://www.enotrans.org/article/timeline-california-high-speed-rail-cost-estimates/\n\nA key part of this story is understanding how far behind its peers the US is in building high-speed rail. This fact sheet on global HSR from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute offers valuable insights on that:\nhttps://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide\n\nAnd this 2013 report from the California Rail Foundation helped us understand some of the political compromises made in the planning of this project: http://calrailfoundation.org/HSR_files/crn713webcen2.pdf\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

So, after a lot of watching from the sidelines, I decided that I needed to try this out for myself - how hard could it actually be? So I ventured to Lofty Pursuits candy store in Tallahassee, FL where Greg & the team taught me how to sling candy - old school style. We made custom flavored drop candy in a press, and two different batches of image candy - one watermelon, and one tiny disgruntled alien. What do you guys think of our final candies?\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nPhil Kinney\nJarvis Rooker\nHannah Bruce\nDave Szamet\nLona Smith\nBryce Jennings\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza","title":"I Made Custom Hard Candy From Scratch","duration":1520,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20220727","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHPTR96Sc1g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dHPTR96Sc1g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2794401}}

{"description":"SUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUnxiP7q4RDDyeioZFZLnXA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGET MERCH HERE: https://www.pivotpodcast.com\n\nWe have had our biggest Pivot guest in Shaq and now today, he may be our smallest guest but by far the biggest show we've done...Kevin Hart joins the Pivot and we promise we didn't F**k this one up!\n\nWith nothing off limits, this conversation is the perfect blend of insightful stories, life experiences and sound advice with some \"light-harted\" moments as Ryan, Channing and Fred talk with Kevin about everything from his career to family to personal miscues to getting to the top and staying there.  \n\nStraight off the stage at Madison Square Garden with Chris Rock and Dave Chapelle, Kevin sits down with us and is very candid about how his journey has evolved and his addiction to winning motivates him everyday to keep being better and expanding. Stressing the power of collaborations and relationships, Kevin says there is room for more than one great in a certain space and sharing success is the best way to stay at the top, recognizing that, the blessing and the curse, is the sacrifices we make to get where we want to be. \n\nRyan asks Kevin how living out some of his personal relationship issues in the public eye with his first marriage and now his second, never affected his persona or allowed scandals to be larger than the purpose. \n\nKevin opens up on how being honest and owning his mistakes publicly allowed him to move forward and also earn respect and grace along the way. Nobody is perfect and when we realize that everyone messes up, it's easier to block out the people who don't matter and focus on what does. Kevin explains how he turned his miscues into humor allowing art to imitate life and became better for it. \n\nLeave it to Channing to derail the conversation as he tries to ask a simple question that pivots the show into an entirely different direction that gives Kevin an up close and personal look into the wild mind of Channing but it doesn't take for Channing to realize he has met his match as Kevin fires back and it's priceless. \n\nGetting into a little Philadelphia history, Fred talks about some of the greats and people Kevin admires from his hometown with the long history of stars. As we get ready to head off to our NFL training camp tour, Ryan couldn't help but ask Kevin about his infamous Philly Super Bowl Snub a few years ago and the story is just as funny now as it was back then. \n\nNew Episodes of the Pivot premiere every Tuesday at Noon eastern with special drops on Friday afternoons. Since January 4th, We have released over 50 episodes, accumulated over 40 million views and have almost 500K subscribers. As We wrap our first season and prepare to hit the road to start our NFL Training camp Tour next Tuesday, we will be bringing you some of the best football guests in the NFL cities we visit- it's going to be a wild ride so thank you for sticking with us and making this PIVOT with us! \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HAPPY DAD: https://youtube.com/channel/UCRVEzpUvlbs06pNZ1WSzg2A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFOLLOW THE PIVOT PODCAST:\nINSTAGRAM | https://instagram.com/thepivot\nTWITTER | https://twitter.com/thepivot\nTIKTOK | https://tiktok.com/@thepivot\nFACEBOOK | https://facebook.com/thepivotpodcast\nSPOTIFY | https://open.spotify.com/show/5KtXTWiC3J5WW1CVTpYG5V\nAPPLE PODCASTS | https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pivot-podcast/id1603292451\n\n#ThePivot\n#Podcast\n#ChanningCrowder\n#FredTaylor\n#RyanClark\n#HappyDad","title":"Kevin Hart on Sacrifice, Success & Never Allowing Mistakes to Overshadow Purpose | The Pivot Podcast","duration":4061,"channel_id":"UCUnxiP7q4RDDyeioZFZLnXA","author":"The Pivot Podcast","date":"20220726","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_alcE8PfzbI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_alcE8PfzbI/hqdefault.jpg?v=62e004c9","content":{"View count":1657209}}
