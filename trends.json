{"description":"Undefeated three-division champion Terence “Bud” Crawford emphatically stamped his place in the history books with a ninth-round TKO over the previously unbeaten Errol “The Truth” Spence Jr. to become the first undisputed welterweight champion of the four-belt era in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions.\n \n“It means everything because of who I took the belts from,” said Crawford. “They talked bad about me. They said I wasn’t good enough and I couldn’t beat these welterweights. I just kept my head to the sky and kept praying to God that I would get the opportunity to show the world how great Terence Crawford is. Tonight, I believe I showed how great I am.”\n \n“He was just better tonight,” said Spence. “He was using the jab. My timing was a little bit off. He was just the better man tonight.”\n \nIn addition to adding the WBC, WBA and IBF titles to his WBO belt, Crawford became the first male fighter to become an undisputed champion in two weight classes, having previously won all four belts at 140-pounds. In a fight where Spence had already been down three times, Crawford’s ninth round onslaught of hooks forced referee Harvey Dock to wave off the action 2:32 in the frame.\n \nAfter years of build-up, Spence came out aggressively in the opening round, jabbing and attacking Crawford’s body. Crawford, who is known for fighting from both the southpaw and orthodox stances, fought primarily as a southpaw and scored his first knockdown in round two with a powerful right cross that caught Spence off balance and sent him down for the first time in his career.\n \n“We practice that,” said Crawford. “Normally in camp we do a flick and jab. But we knew that wasn’t going to work with Errol Spence because he’s durable, he’s strong. So we had to practice a strong firm jab. The jab hit him and stopped him in his tracks.”\n \n“He was just throwing the hard jab,” said Spence. “He was timing with his jab. His timing was just on point. I wasn’t surprised by his speed or his accuracy. It was everything I thought.”\n \nSpence came out in round three determined to turn the tide after the knockdown, throwing big shots, including a left hook that landed cleanly early. However, Crawford was able to withstand the attack and showed his precision by landing a clean counter right that again staggered Spence.\n \n“Errol Spence is a tremendous talent and he’s got a great jab,” said Crawford. “We were worried about the jab coming in because that’s how he sets up all of his shots.  Our main focus was the jab. You take away his best attribute. The rest is history.”\n \nIn round seven, Crawford dropped Spence twice, once with a clean right uppercut early on and again late in the round with a right hook. Crawford led 79-70 on all three cards at the time of the stoppage and dominated the CompuBox stats with an 185 to 96 advantage in punches landed and an astounding 50% connect rate.\n \nPost-fight, Crawford showed his respect for Spence stepping up to the plate and making the super fight happen and spoke to the historic nature of the matchup, while Spence expressed his interest in a rematch later this year.\n \n“We gotta do it again,” said Spence. “I’m going to be a lot better. It’ll be a lot closer. It’ll probably be in December and the end of the year. I say we gotta do it again.”\n \n“Like I said before, I only dreamed of being a world champion,” said Crawford. “I’m an overachiever. Nobody believed in me when I was coming up, but I made everybody a believer. I want to thank Spence and his team because without him none of this would have been possible.”\n\n#TerenceCrawford #ErrolSpenceJr #SpenceCrawford\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Spence vs Crawford HIGHLIGHTS: JULY 29, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":100,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20230730","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zPaYp8XN9Y","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_zPaYp8XN9Y/hqdefault.webp?v=64c5fc03","content":{"View count":2967480}}

Recently, the concept of a Barbenheimer double feature emerge, and what seemed like just an internet meme translated into actual, real-world, box office dollars. Take that, Morbius!\n\nBarbenheimer definitely raises some questions. Like how did this insane pairing of films come to be? What do these movies have in common?

cuando quiero\nPor debajo del portero\nEste caballero pateando como delantero\nLes parte el trasero \nSoy el lobo que revuelca el gallinero\nNi con balas de plata muero siempre nuevo\ncomo el primero de enero.\nLo mío nunca caduca\nYa yo no tiro punchlines\nYo disparo con bazooka\nMis barras botas mas humo que un salón de hookas\nCon media yuca les parto la nuca\nY como a Farruko se les vuela la peluca\nDesde mi niñez tengo lucidez\nNo creo en el 2, no creo en el 3\nCreo en el 1 y el 0, es\npor eso soy el 10.\nYo los muerdo,\nno pueden conmigo estos cerdos\nNi peleando solo con el ojo izquierdo\nNi aunque Drake apueste a favor mío pierdo.\nMe comí todos los entremeses\nEn esta pecera ya no veo peses \nSin que me interese\nComo cuando hablo y me como las eses\nMe dicen Cesar Millan a veces\nPorque cuando el Residente habla\nEstos perros obedecen\nSoy imparable ni aunque recen \nMil veces todos los meses\nSoy como Messi clavándose a los franceses\nPorque desde Calle 13\nEl rap y

cada raperito\nla cuantifico.\nEstoy enfermo porque mientras más les doy me excito.\nHasta el planeta Tierra me pide a los gritos: “¡NOOOO\nMEJOR QUE CAIGA UN METEORITO!”\nDicen que estoy maldito porque sin varita mágica y sin sombrerito\nyo los convierto en pajaritos.\nSolo recito mis escritos y vuelan pal carajo\ncomo los celulares que tira Benito.\nViven menos que un mosquito,\nsus películas no duran porque yo se las edito.\nMe dicen Almodovar sin tener un guión escrito\nporque yo no vivo para el Rap, el Rap vive en la piel que habito.\nPerdonan que presuma pero saben que el Residente\nes peligroso con la pluma, cinta negra con la tinta\ncolor puma, como Snoop Dog se los fuma.\n¡Ni pidiendo por la paz mundial, los salva Maluma!\nEstoy entre la bruma jangueando con Moctezuma,\nno me llegan aunque sean contables no les da la suma.\nEstoy tirando tanta peste, que ni con un baño de espuma\nesta pista se perfuma.\nVoy de cacería con mi artillería\nmontada en las caballerías de letras en coreografía\ncon una maestría en poesía con ingeniería.\nMe ven las arpías pasar con mi palabrería y\n“Shhhh..se quedan en silencio como en una librería”\nEstas porquerías se duermen en la portería\naunque sea de día por eso con mucha alegría\npaso por la vía y ¡GOL DE DI MARIA!\nNi la sicología entendería\ncomo tengo tanta energía en un beat sin batería.\nY tantas preguntas que de fijo,\nSoy como si Sócrates y Platón tuvieran un hijo.\nCon la crisis de los cuarenta no soy el mismo,\nSiento que tengo otra persona dentro de mi organismo.\n\nSoy el amor que te ama, AMÁNDOTE.\nQuiero querer, quererte, QUERIÉNDOTE.\nY si yo estoy aquí y tu estás allá,\nquiero que vengas aquí y salgas de allá.\nTe falta lo que tengo aquí, me falta lo que tienes allá.\nY si no

{"description":"The Exorcist: Believer\nOnly in Theaters October 13\n\nExactly 50 years ago this fall, the most terrifying horror film in history landed on screens, shocking audiences around the world. Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.   \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar® nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own.  \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia Marcum), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil.  \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar® winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before. \n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid’s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela’s neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela’s friend.  \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award® nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.   \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty.  \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment.  \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Yücer. Universal Pictures presents a Blumhouse/Morgan Creek Entertainment production in association with Rough House Pictures.  \n \nOfficial Website: https://theexorcistbeliever.movie/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheExorcistBeliever/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theexorcistbeliever/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheExorcistBlvr\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@theexorcistbeliever\n\n#TheExorcistBeliever","title":"The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer","duration":183,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230725","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxpPMyGcpU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PIxpPMyGcpU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":22556515}}
