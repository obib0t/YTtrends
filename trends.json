{"description":"HELLO! TerminalMontage just released another Pokemon Battle Royale! And once again I helped by doing the research and writing. Now in THIS video, I'm going to explain some of the finer details, as well as why certain things happen, including why certain Pokemon fared so well and even won! \n\nWatch (or re-watch, or re-re-watch) the Original! ‚û§ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl-Okv32Cg0\n\nWoah we've got MERCH!  ‚û§   https://www.gnoggin.net/\n\nSocials:\nXitter  ‚û§   http://twitter.com/Lockstin\nThreads ‚û§  https://www.threads.net/@lockstin_gnoggin\nInstagram ‚û§ https://goo.gl/zmJDxr\n\nAdditional Credits:\nWriter/Host: Lockstin Austin Lockwood\nVideo Edtor: Fineapple Ryan Porter\nOriginal Video Animation:  @TerminalMontage and the team.\n\n#pokemon #pokemonexplained #somethingseries \n\nChapters:\n00:00 Oh yeah! New Battle Royale!\n00:47 Why No Sylveon or Raichu?\n01:21 Explaining Bits of the Battle!\n09:05 Why the Fire Types?\n14:14 Why Pikachu V Blaziken?\n\nGnoggin, hosted by its creator Lockstin, is a show delving into the mysteries of Pokemon! (and other games sometimes too). Explaining everything there is to explain! Why is each Pokemon given the type it has? What are their origins? What is the lore of the Pokemon world and the design inspirations? And what does it all have to do with alchemy? Let's Go find out!\n\nBonus deleted scenes for the bottom of the description!\n     One joke I wrote but Jeremy (rightfully) cut was Eevee finding a Waterstone, looking at it with vehement disgust, and then moving on... if you know you know.  \n         Serperior and Quaquaval originally had a much more intense... binding moment... it was reduced to under a second for your sake... I, I really don't know what was going on with me while writing this one...\n\nYou'll notice there's a semi-secret second Eevee at the end of the Eeveeloutions scene. Earlier drafts of this royale feature multiple copies of some of the starters, such as Partner Pikachu AND regular Pikachu from Yellow, or 2 different Rowlets for example, one for Sun and Moon, and one for Legends Arceus. The semi-secret second Eevee has a Katana, it's the Eevee from Conquest specifically, it was left as just a small visual gag/nod to that. Also at one point, I considered including the many starter Pokemon from Pokemon Battle Revolution too, but ultimately that would add too many Pokemon that most people would just be confused by... So we left it to the main game's Starter Pokemon.","title":"EXPLAINING The Starter Pokemon Battle Royale from @TerminalMontage! üí•","duration":1448,"channel_id":"UC6sjkvDzyY0J8o7k2Kc5rEw","author":"Lockstin & Gnoggin","date":"20231115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_VHfcpNcPA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1_VHfcpNcPA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":542728}}

{"description":"Explore a bustling new world and get up close and personal with neighbors in The Sims‚Ñ¢ 4 For Rent Expansion Pack*, launching Dec 7 at 10 a.m. PT. Pre-order or buy through January 18 to get the Street Eats Digital Content**! (This content will become available when the pack launches.) Pre-order now: https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-for-rent-expansion-pack \n \nThere‚Äôs a new way for Sims to generate income ‚Äì by investing in Residential Rentals. As a property owner your Sim can live among their tenants and be a hands-on property manager, or they can live away from their investment in a separate residence. But don‚Äôt let them get passive about this income stream! Property owners will have to keep their unit ratings high through regular maintenance or they could wind up dealing with a Tenant Revolt.\n \nResidential Rentals are more than just a way for savvy Sims to make Simoleons; they‚Äôre a way to bring communities together and tell new kinds of stories. Maybe your Sim is starting fresh in a basement suite, or maybe two young Sims become sweethearts after growing up in different units of the same duplex. You can now divide lots into multiple units, which creates new possibilities for what you can build. It also means different families will be living on the same lot and have plenty of chances to interact with each other.\n \nYour Sims can bond with their neighbors, chatting by the mailboxes in their apartment building or enjoying food together at a potluck. Or, they can seize the opportunity to dig up dirt on everyone around them. Eavesdropping, snooping, and breaking into their neighbors units are all on the table.\n \nAvailable Dec 7 at 10 a.m. PT on Origin PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation¬Æ4, and PlayStation¬Æ5. \n \nPre-order now: https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-for-rent-expansion-pack\n \n*Requires The Sims 4 & all game updates.

However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina‚Äôs ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina‚Äôs crosshairs.

{"description":"Every now and then the F1 organisers throw a spanner in the works - and we typically get a very unusual Grand Prix. And that‚Äôs likely to be true for the first race on the new circuit in Las Vegas. \n\nIt‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs a street track and the race starts at 10pm local time. But the biggest challenge for the teams is that at that time, it‚Äôs going to be cold‚Ä¶ really cold. \n\nSo, why is the drastically colder than usual temperature such an issue? What are the teams and drivers going to do about it? And are we going to see an incredibly chaotic race?\n\nFormula One cars really don‚Äôt work well at cold temperatures. Now, this is counterintuitive. You might notice that all of the fastest laps at your local kart track were set in the evening or at night. But in F1, the power units and in particular, the tyres just aren‚Äôt made to work when temperatures are below about 15 degrees celsius. \n\nAnd you might ask, why?

{"description":"Under extreme pressures, matter defies the rules of physics as we know it.\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nPhysicists have a pretty good handle on how stuff behaves on the surface of the Earth. But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. \n\nWhat happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF‚Äôs Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures‚Äã‚Äã) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens. A few standout findings so far:\n\nWater can become a hot black ice that conducts electricity: https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-hot-superionic-ice-may-be-natures-most-common-form-of-water-20190508/\n\nHydrogen gas can be compressed down into a shiny metal: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119442-metallic-hydrogen-finally-made-in-lab-at-mind-boggling-pressure/\n\nSodium (a soft, silvery metal at atmospheric pressure) can turn transparent: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312180838.htm\n\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://cmap.rochester.edu/\n\nWhat happens under extreme pressures deep with planets also influences their ability to foster life. Check out our videos about the search for Earth-like worlds beyond our solar system:\n\nWhat we found when we went looking for another Earth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrAFaONyLtU\n\nHow to find a planet you can‚Äôt see:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STsI6IbPbGQ \n\nHere‚Äôs  a closer look at another giant laser (at the National Ignition Facility):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMaKhXkihGQ \n\nTo see a classic film that takes a similar approach to understanding distances (from the microscopic to the galactic) check out ‚ÄúPowers of Ten‚Äù:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0 \n\nThis material is based upon work of the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP), supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY-2020249.

The brand new teaser is now here and throughout this video we're gonna be talking about the characters, plot and all the things connected to Spider-mans big web.\n\nNow the film is gonna be the first of three Sony Marvel movies to release next year with the others being Kraven and Venom 3. Beyond The Spider-verse was originally meant to release then too but theyre just taking their time with it to make it the best film possible. Its totally fair enough and I am curious to see how things go with this movie. It's gonna be heavily rooted in time travel and early leaks were saying that it's basically Terminator but with Peter Parker instead of John Connor.\n\nEither way we're gonna be going through it all and if you enjoy the video then please hit the thumbs up. Don't forget to subscribe for breakdowns like this every day and with that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into Madam Web.\n\n-\n\nNow the teaser begins with something we'll talk about in just a bit but it basically shows how events throughout the film will be repeated throughout. It has web entering a diner where shes united with the heroes of the film before theyre all attacked and killed by an evil version of spider-man. From here we jump to a week prior where we see her working as a paramedic. She almost dies when doing this and is sent over the edge of a bridge on a car. Nearly drowning we see certain clips in her visions and these include her standing infront of a spiders web in a tree. There's also a shot of someone holding a baby and then passing this on. Theres also her falling into the water and im guessing that these are visions of the future which will happen throughout the film.","title":"MADAME WEB Trailer Breakdown | Spider-Man Easter Eggs, Things You Missed & Reaction","duration":856,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20231115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu9i-5SSSkI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mu9i-5SSSkI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":248050}}

{"description":"A new universe awaits on Netflix, starting December 22.\n\nFrom Zack Snyder, the filmmaker behind 300, Man of Steel, and Army of the Dead, comes REBEL MOON, a 2-part movie event decades in the making.\n\nAfter crash landing on a moon in the furthest reaches of the universe, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a stranger with a mysterious past, begins a new life among a peaceful settlement of farmers. But she soon becomes their only hope for survival when the tyrannical Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) and his cruel emissary, Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), discover the farmers have unwittingly sold their crops to the Bloodaxes (Cleopatra Coleman and Ray Fisher) ‚Äî leaders of a fierce group of insurgents hunted by the Motherworld.\n\nTasked with finding fighters who would risk their lives to defend the people of Veldt, Kora and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a tenderhearted farmer naive in the realities of war, journey to different worlds in search of the Bloodaxes, and assemble a small band of warriors who share a common need for redemption along the way: Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a pilot and gun for hire; General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a legendary commander; Nemesis (Doona Bae), a master swordswoman; Tarak (Staz Nair), a captive with a regal past; and Milius (E. Duffy), a resistance fighter. Back on Veldt, Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins), an ancient mechanized protector hiding in the wings, awakens with a new purpose. But the newly formed revolutionaries must learn to trust each other and fight as one before the armies of the Motherworld come to destroy them all.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with over 247 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

{"description":"The Darien Gap known as the world's most dangerous jungle. I had heard of the Darien many years ago through National Geographic and it had both fascinated and intimidated me. I knew one day I would have to visit...\n\nWhen the word Darien started appearing in the news in recent years by way of the migrant crises I decided that now was the time to explore it for myself. And so myself and my good friend @TimmyKarter headed north from Medellin in search of a way across the infamous jungle, avoiding cartel and bandits, injury and tropical diseases, on an adventure with migrants from all over the world where national laws don't apply. Only the laws of the jungle.\n\nJoin us as we enter...the Darien.","title":"I Was Trafficked Through The World's Deadliest Jungle","duration":2991,"channel_id":"UCxDZs_ltFFvn0FDHT6kmoXA","author":"bald and bankrupt","date":"20231111","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aswvkdCpZYc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aswvkdCpZYc/hqdefault.webp?v=654e2704","content":{"View count":1969386}}

{"description":"üößThings are getting messyüöß\n\nDisney and Pixar's #InsideOut2 is coming to theaters June 2024 with brand new emotions!\n\nThe little voices inside Riley‚Äôs head know her inside and out‚Äîbut next summer, everything changes when Disney and Pixar‚Äôs ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù introduces a new Emotion: Anxiety. According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. ‚ÄúAnxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she‚Äôs not really the type to take a back seat,‚Äù said Mann. ‚ÄúThat makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.‚Äù A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar‚Äôs ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who‚Äôve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren‚Äôt sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she‚Äôs not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù releases only in theaters Summer 2024.","title":"Inside Out 2 | Teaser Trailer","duration":90,"channel_id":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","author":"Pixar","date":"20231109","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWavstJydZU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VWavstJydZU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":12241044}}

Craft the everyday food, fuel, weapons, ammo and space suit upgrades you‚Äôll need to survive out here in the vastness of the cosmos.\n\nIn space there is no up or down! Expand your base in any direction for the most efficient layout. Once you are equipped with the necessary fuel and a warp drive, you‚Äôll be free to explore other sectors and continue your mission.\n\nCircumnavigate tiny asteroids, fly between abandoned outposts, and board derelict spaceships as they orbit the system. Take caution, however, and remember to keep your jetpack fuel topped up‚Äìyou‚Äôll need it to get back to your Space Rig safe and sound!\n\nEach salvage zone is a procedurally generated, dynamic, and ever-changing open world.\n\nYou are an employee for the galaxy‚Äôs number one waste disposal firm, stranded far away from home with a mission to clean the galaxy from the remains of a galactic war.Space trash is your main resource. Whether it is salvaged debris floating in space, advanced and rare tech from wrecked ships, or scavenged goods from asteroid surfaces, you‚Äôll want to snatch it all up!\n\nRecycle and refine it to produce valuable goods that will net a tidy sum on the Trash Exchange, and spend it to upgrade your kit.\n\nYou‚Äôre not alone amid the wreckage. Alien bots patrol most sectors of space nowadays and they‚Äôll be drawn to you as your operation expands.\n\nYou‚Äôll need a steady aim, impeccable defenses, and an upgraded armory to protect your Space Rig from the dangers of these foes. Survival depends on your ability to defend yourself!\n\n...and more!\nWe'll be adding more and more to Space Trash Scavenger, so be sure to wishlist and follow for updates!

We also now know how this sets up the future of the MCu and a rough idea of where it could all be going for the upcoming films. I won't be covering The Marvels ending incase you haven't seen it but later on we might give some theories for Deadpool 3 and Avengers Secret Wars.\n\nThat will all be at the end of the video though and last week saw Loki getting the band back together to travel back to the loom in order to stop it from self destructing.\n\nThat takes us into this episode in which we get a lot of major revelations. For that final time I'm gonna need you to hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe because we still have a lot of comic content coming soon. With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into The Loki Season 2 Finale.\n\n-\n\nNow as always we begin with the marvel studios logo however here somethings different.
