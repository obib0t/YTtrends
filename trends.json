{"description":"A jury has convicted a Wisconsin man of killing six people and injuring dozens of others when he drove his SUV into a Christmas parade last year. Darrell Brooks was found guilty Wednesday of all 76 charges, including six counts of first-degree intentional homicide. He drove into the parade in Waukesha on Nov. 21 after fleeing a domestic disturbance with an ex-girlfriend. Dozens of other people were hurt. Brooks dismissed his public defenders days before his trial began in early October and defended himself throughout the proceedings. He was removed from the courtroom at times for his erratic outbursts and confrontational exchanges with the judge.\n\nSubscribe to FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClwddNv0Cr6SIEGkzVK886w?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch FOX 9 Live: https://www.fox9.com/live\n\nFOX 9 is your source for breaking news, live events, investigations, politics, entertainment, business news and local stories from Minneapolis-St. Paul, the greater Twin Cities metro, Greater Minnesota, western Wisconsin and across the nation.

{"description":"The 2023 Honda Civic Type R (50,050$ in Canada, $42,895 starting in the US) is the newest rendition of the beloved hot hatchback from Japan. Now with more horsepower and more torque, along with a fresh new look, the new Civic Type R aims to please. 315 horsepower and 310 lb ft of torque are pushed out of a turbo four-cylinder engine, and a limited-slip differential up front helps ensure the power gets put down. Thomas takes the helm for his first drive in the new FL5 generation. Will it be able to live up to the previous generations and be a worthy successor? The bar was already pretty high - let‚Äôs see what the new one can do. We hope you enjoy the episode. Thanks for watching!

{"description":"Watch the Censored Version here: https://youtu.be/e-nO5DBMQDc\nIt felt wrong to write a whole script in Carmilla‚Äôs voice and not use some‚Ä¶ colorful adult language!! It‚Äôs too in character!! Anyway if you haven‚Äôt seen Castlevania, it‚Äôs a Netflix Original animation that‚Äôs (kind of, anyway haha) based off of the Castlevania video game series! I thought it was perrrrrfect to do for Halloween!!! Classic vampires :‚Äô) \nHopefully if you haven‚Äôt seen it, this video should be self-explanatory enough! I based it off of Season 2 (season 1 only has 4 episodes) - so you won‚Äôt get too many major spoilers, just setting up some stuff Carmilla wants to do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Listen I just really wanted an excuse to put up my Dracula portrait in the background (-: (BUT ITS BLURRED ANYWAY SO YOU CAN‚ÄôT EVEN SEE IT ARGH)\n\nALSO the video is so zoomed in; check out my instagram to see the whole dress!! IT IS A WHOLE LEWK: https://www.instagram.com/gibiofficial\n\nAnd I‚Äôm gonna post a bunch of tik toks of her too!! \n\nThis was sooo fun and indulgent for me to write and make, so I hope you enjoy it too!! I know there are some Castlevania fans lurking in my community! :) \n\nPS - Carmilla is literally so evil, like just a very very bad person (vampire) - I tried to show off her more manipulative side in this video hehehehe. But she does touch your face and stuff WITHOUT ASKING..!!!! !!  but that‚Äôs it; shouldn‚Äôt be anything else bad in this video! \n\nHmmm what else!?\n-IM MAD ABOUT MY WIG, IF YOU NOTICE IT, NO YOU DIDN‚ÄôT \n-Also my accent..... COULD'VE BEEN WORSE, RIGHT\n-I created a fake stained glass window for this hehehehehe do u like it\n-Also that is a gargoyle behind me that you cant see \n-I got my dress commissioned by a prom dress company HAHAH - shoulder pads made by me!\n-Fangs are from Etsy!

A decade after their unforgettable eight-season run, comedy's most fabulous foursome is back. Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally reprise their celebrated roles as Will, Grace, Jack and Karen. The 11th and final season of Will & Grace will feature 18 episodes. Behold once again, from the minds of Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, TV's wittiest ensemble ever. The legendary James Burrows, director of every original Will & Grace episode, has returned with a slew of razor-sharp jabs and dirty martinis. Will & Grace stands as NBC's most watched comedy in seven years. Originally debuting in 1998, Will & Grace has been nominated for 91 Emmy Awards, winning 18 of them, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The series has also earned seven SAG Awards and the show is one of the few in TV history where each member of the cast has won an Emmy.\n\nWill & Grace\nhttps://www.youtube.com/WillandGrace\n\nGoogle Play, Just Watch & iTunes links\nhttps://play.google.com/store/tv/show/Will_Grace?id=NhiqWDfkmbrmj1fLIJpicA&hl=en_US&gl=US\nhttps://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/will-and-grace\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/tv-season/will-grace-series-1-8/id1291098172","title":"The Legend: Beverly Leslie ü§ç  | Will & Grace","duration":486,"channel_id":"UCLem9J0NkphqGbIYX5_uZBw","author":"Will & Grace","date":"20221025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00nuImDfnjA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/00nuImDfnjA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":309082}}

{"description":"Speculation has been swirling since former Chinese President Hu Jintao was escorted out from the closing session of China‚Äôs twice a decade Communist Party‚Äôs Congress on Saturday (Oct 22), which saw Mr Hu's successor, Xi Jinping secure an unprecedented third term at the helm. \n\nCNA‚Äôs cameras captured the moments just prior to Mr Hu's departure, which took place soon after local and foreign media were allowed to enter the auditorium to cover proceedings around 11.15am. It came shortly after Chinese state media announced that delegates had elected a new Central Committee and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which media were not allowed into the hall to witness. \n\nCurrent chairman of China's legislature Li Zhanshu is seen taking papers out of Mr Hu's hand, before a man comes to speak to him and escorts him out. READ: https://cna.asia/3TwGKK7\n\nFollowing Mr Hu‚Äôs departure, proceedings continued with delegates voting on other items on the agenda including an amendment to the party‚Äôs constitution. Addressing the incident later that night, Chinese state media attributed the incident to health reasons. In a tweet written in English, Xinhua said that Mr Hu was ‚Äúnot feeling well‚Äù during the session and for his health, staff had accompanied to a room next to the meeting venue ‚Äúfor a rest‚Äù. Mr Hu's name was censored from Chinese social media.\n\nREAD MORE: https://cna.asia/3z7jDNS\n\nSubscribe to our channel here: https://cna.asia/youtubesub \n\nSubscribe to our news service on Telegram: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\nFollow us:\nCNA: https://cna.asia\nCNA Lifestyle: http://www.cnalifestyle.com \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@channelnewsasia","title":"Exclusive: What happened before former Chinese President Hu Jintao was escorted out of Congress?","duration":176,"channel_id":"UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg","author":"CNA","date":"20221024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBG2bD-TE9g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZBG2bD-TE9g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2011819}}

Check out our MERCH Store Here ‚Üí https://http://shopzeroedition.com/collections/screen-crush-merch\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has just dropped its first trailer! It includes our first look at Casie Lang in her superhero outfit, Bill Murray in the MCU, and Kang the conqueror. So we‚Äôre here to explain all of this, where they are, and what this means as we break down all easter eggs references and little things you might have missed in the first trailer for Ant Man and the Wasp Quantummania.\n\nGo here ‚Üí http://screencrush.com/\nTikTok ‚Üí https://www.tiktok.com/@screencrushnews\nLike us ‚Üí https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush\nFollow us ‚Üí https://twitter.com/screencrushnews\nGet our newsletter ‚Üí http://screencrush.com/newsletter/\n\nWritten by Ryan Arey, Srinidhi Rao, with invaluable help form Harriet Lengel-Enright and Randolf Nombrado\nHosted by Ryan Arey (http://twitter.com/ryanarey)\nEdited by Harriet Lengel-Enright, Randolf Nombrado, Brianna McLarty, Ethan Lavinsky, srinidhi Rao, and Ryan Arey\n\n#AntMan #Quantumania #eastereggs \nNow before we get into all their weird quantum stuff let‚Äôs go to ordinary san francisco where scott lang is having a dream life. Unlike most heroes getting powers isn;t hurting scott‚Äôs personal life it‚Äôs improved iit. He‚Äôs well known around his neighborhood and as we learn in ms marvel he has a very popular superhero podcast called Big Me Little Me: A Scott Lang Interview.\n\nThis podcast is how Kamala Khan learned all the behind the scenes details of the final battle in endgame0‚Äìand Scott is the person bringing these stories to the masses. So in a  lot of ways Scott is the most accessible avenger. He‚Äôs the everyman.\n\nAnd we see him being honored at his old baskin robbins. This is of course a callback to the first any-man film where this was his first job out [rison‚Äìand they fired him when they found out he had a record. [clip]. Now he's been given an award for employee of the century‚Äìand this guy is the boss who fired him in the first place.\n\nNotice that the nametag on the photo says jack, because he worked there under a pseudonym. [Baskin Robbins always finds out]. Ironic that now they're celebrating him, and he wasn‚Äôt even allowed to work there under his own name. \n\nNotice also that his suit is slightly different now with this circle on the chest. I can‚Äôt help but think that the quantum suits in the endgame might have had some effect on the design. Those suits were designed by Tony Stark but did not feature the circle in the middle . However the quantum suits would have given scott and hank pym cces to some stark tech‚Äìspecifically the way stark‚Äôs power systems always seem to be routed through an object on his chest. So the redesign could be based in stark tech or just a  tribute to the fallen hero tony stark.\n\nHe high fived a kid with an ant-man backpack. A big step up from when they didn;t know his name in the endgame. [clip selfie with me?]\n\nNow of course he‚Äôs not only an avenger he‚Äôs a guy who saved the universe. He and hope get invited to red carpets‚Äìlike this one, for the global service humanitarian awards sponsored by the anthropology society. ‚Äìwhere Scott is probably getting a trophy for, you know, saving reality [what if we could go back to before thanos].\n\nNow of course, he may be famous now, but scott is still just scott, and not everyone knows who he is [thanks spider-,an]. This is a callback to this joke [there‚Äôs an atman and a spider-man]. It may also show how public opinion about spider-man has shifted. Remember that psyterio did frame him for muder [clip]. And then right after revealed his secret identity, which was undone in no way home. But, here‚Äôs the thing. I wonder if the strange memory spell that made people forget about Peter Parker also undid people thinking he killed mysterio? Or at the very least, it‚Äôs nice to see there‚Äô some people out there who just support spicy and don;t believe Quentin Beck [nwh, mysterio was right].\n\nNotice the coffee shop has lots of San Francisco themed drinks. It's called the drive cafe, named after the golden gate bridge. And the drinks are named after San Fran locations or events. The Embarcadero, Summer of Love, The Haight, Presidio, Pier 39, Golden Gate, and The Candlestick, after Candlestick park.\n \nThe abstract art in the coffee shop also looks a lot like the design of the Quantum Realm, foreshadowing what is to come. \n\nBack to the Pym household, which we say has been moved back from its original location, after Hank placed it on the beach in ant-man and the wasp. And then we meet a recast Cassie Lang, now played by Kathryn Newton from Detective Pikachu and Big Little Lies.  Don‚Äôt think Marvel‚Äôs ever said why they recast older cassie form endgame‚Äìmight be because she tweeted a picture of herself announcing she had been cast. Or maybe they just wanted a different actor because cassie is going to become the superhero satture, like she is in the comics.","title":"ANT-MAN: QUANTUMANIA Trailer BREAKDOWN: Every Kang Easter Egg and Loki Connection","duration":1176,"channel_id":"UCgMJGv4cQl8-q71AyFeFmtg","author":"ScreenCrush","date":"20221024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ6sKzBARVo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hJ6sKzBARVo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":501377}}

{"description":"New Jersey is the only state in the U.S. that doesn‚Äôt allow customers to pump their own gas ‚Äî anywhere. There‚Äôs always an attendant on duty to pump gas for customers at these full-service stations.\n\nOregon is the only other state besides New Jersey with a full-service law. However, Oregon‚Äôs laws are far less strict and allow certain parts of the state to have self-service gas stations.\n\n‚ÄúIt goes back to the middle of the 20th century,‚Äù said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth Polling Institute. ‚ÄúThere were forces involved who wanted to protect their interests in terms of the smaller gas owners against mega gas stations that were starting to be built at the time that would require self-service to be profitable.‚Äù\n\nHistorically, gas stations with attendants were popular in the first half of the 1900s. But by the 1970s, most states had switched over to customers pumping their own gas. As these changes swept the U.S., a state ban on self-service in 1949, known as the Retail Gasoline Dispensing Safety Act, stopped the Garden State from following suit. Oregon passed its own similar law in 1951.\nIn the original bill, the New Jersey state legislature cited safety concerns and rising costs to consumers as reasons to not transition over to self-service. But every time there‚Äôs a spike in gas prices, bills opposing full service start to pop up. Seen as a ‚Äòpolitical third rail‚Äô by many politicians including Gov. Phil Murphy, it‚Äôs one of the few legislative debates that doesn‚Äôt follow party lines. Every bill has failed so far, but it hasn‚Äôt stopped self-serve advocacy groups and politicians from pushing for change.\n\nWatch the video above to find out more about New Jersey‚Äôs full-service gas stations, why self-service options don‚Äôt find a home in the Garden State, and what‚Äôs next for its gas station owners.\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC:¬†https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV:¬†https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
