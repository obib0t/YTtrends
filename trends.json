{"description":"SpaceX is targeting as soon as Monday, April 17 at 8:00 a.m. CT for the first flight test of a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy rocket from Starbase in Texas. \n\nStarship is a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, help humanity return to the Moon and travel to Mars and beyond. With a test such as this, success is measured by how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship. \n\nTo date, the SpaceX team has completed multiple sub-orbital flight tests of Starship‚Äôs upper stage from Starbase, successfully demonstrating an unprecedented approach to controlled flight. These flight tests helped validate the vehicle‚Äôs design, proving Starship can fly through the subsonic phase of entry before re-lighting its engines and flipping itself to a vertical configuration for landing.\n\nIn addition to the testing of Starship‚Äôs upper stage, the team has conducted numerous tests of the Super Heavy rocket, which include the increasingly complex static fires that led to a full-duration 31 Raptor engine test ‚Äì the largest number of simultaneous rocket engine ignitions in history. The team has also constructed the world‚Äôs tallest rocket launch and catch tower. At 146 meters, or nearly 500 feet tall, the launch and catch tower is designed to support vehicle integration, launch, and catch of the Super Heavy rocket booster. For the first flight test, the team will not attempt a vertical landing of Starship or a catch of the Super Heavy booster.\n\nA live webcast of the flight test will begin ~45 minutes before liftoff. As is the case with all developmental testing, this schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay tuned to our social media channels for updates.","title":"Starship Flight Test","duration":2755,"channel_id":"UCtI0Hodo5o5dUb67FeUjDeA","author":"SpaceX","date":"20230417","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5QXreqOrTA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L5QXreqOrTA/hqdefault.jpg?v=643c35de","content":{"View count":5781480}}

{"description":"An overview of the 2023 Ohio train derailment.\nWatch this video ad-free along with lots of exclusive content at https://go.nebula.tv/practical-engineering\n\nOn the evening of Friday, February 3, 2023, 38 of 149 cars of a Norfolk Southern Railway freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Five of the derailed cars were carrying vinyl chloride, a hazardous material that built up pressure in the resulting fires, eventually leading Norfolk Southern to vent and burn it in a bid to prevent an explosion. The ensuing fireball and cloud brought the normally unseen process of hazardous cargo transportation into a single chilling view, and the event became a lightning rod of controversy over rail industry regulations, federal involvement in chemical spills, and much more.\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

But then it's up to you to achieve success and take over New York City any way you like.\n\nSlowly build multiple small businesses, grow them into huge corporations, or carve your own unique path ‚Äì the possibilities are limitless in this vast business sandbox. You've never played anything like this!\n\nGo from a small apartment and public transport to luxury suites, fast cars and designer furniture. Put your money into investment funds and real estate. Succeed, fail, rebuild. But remember to take care of yourself, sleep and stay happy on your rise to the top.\n\nDo you have what it takes to build your own empire?\n\n\nGo from nothing to the most prominent tycoon in New York. Start a business, work smart, make it thrive and enjoy your life. How do you want to be successful? How far can you push it? How long can you make it last?\n\nStart your own gift shop, supermarket, coffee shop, law firm, clothing store, liquor store, florist, and more. You decide what success is - whether it‚Äôs a single shop, a chain of fast-food restaurants, a huge corporation, or making millions developing websites.\n\nTake out a loan, rent a building, design the logo, renovate the store, get stock, manage your money, hire staff, and build your infrastructure. Soon, you may have to start importing products from the harbour and distributing them through a network of warehouses.\n\nA bigger business means managers. Hire HR Managers, Logistics Managers, and Purchasing Agents. They all need desks and computers, so you‚Äôll need a fancy headquarters.\n\nNeed a delivery truck? Travel to a dealer and buy one. Need food? Go to a supermarket, but make sure you have a refrigerator at home. Big Ambitions is a life sim where your character has to physically interact with the world to survive and succeed.\n\nEnter any building in New York and buy it. Go from a small apartment to a dream penthouse in midtown, a luxurious townhouse in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, or a series of skyscrapers. Fill each with furniture that suits your style and standing. Invest your hard-earned cash in real estate to grow your empire. Take over the city piece by piece.\n\nSpend your wealth however you wish. Buy a big SUV, a speedy sports car, or the new luxurious Mersaidi S500. Maybe risk it all at the casinos or put your money into investment funds and reap the rewards.\n\nAs you progress, you always need to ensure you get enough sleep and stay healthy and happy. Enjoy the journey, for as you grow older, you‚Äôll discover that money can‚Äôt buy you time... or can it?\n\nBig Ambitions takes what you love about the viral sensation ‚ÄòStartup Company‚Äô to even greater heights.","title":"I Became a Multimillionaire and Turned an Entire City Into a Total Wasteland - Big Ambitions","duration":1827,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20230416","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77zyN0WUuE0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/77zyN0WUuE0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2266710}}

{"description":"Hello and welcome to another video!\n\nToday we‚Äôre going to be recreating a recipe that we saw going viral on tiktok last year: the mac & cheese milkshake! We thought that cheese foam on bubble tea was good when we tried it on this channel, and cheesecake is good too (hey - cheese is good in general, right?), so this recipe might not be all that bad, even if it was originally intended to be an April fool‚Äôs joke.\n\nSo bring on the dairy - we‚Äôre making a Mac & Cheese Milkshake! Let us know how you think we did, and if you might want to try this lactose heavy delicacy. \n\nAlso PS - we had a slight complication with our camera on set, so the wide shot is a little soft focused. We tried to fix it in post, but it is still a little noticeable.

Love y'all...Thank you.\n\nClick here to listen:\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/wiiltbam\n\nFollow DAX: @ thatsdax \nShot by: Logan Meis\nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#ToBeAMan #Dax #masculinity #manhood #manosphere #masculine #men #traditionalman \n\nLyrics:\n\nI can‚Äôt hide myself\nI don‚Äôt expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it‚Äôs like to be a man\nIt‚Äôs a lonely road, and they don‚Äôt care about what you know\nIt‚Äôs not about how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nYeah\nI know this life can really beat you down\nYou wanna scream but you won‚Äôt make a sound\nGot so much weight that you've been holding but won‚Äôt show any emotion\nAs a man it goes unspoken\nThat we can‚Äôt cry when life gets hard\nUnconditional love‚Äôs for women, children, and dogs\nWe know that we just have to play our parts\nAnd don‚Äôt nobody give a d*mn about our broken hearts, yeah\n \nAs a man we gotta pave our way\nOur only function is to work and slave\nThere‚Äôs no respect for you if you ain‚Äôt payed\nYou‚Äôre disregarded as a human and you can‚Äôt complain\n And if you ever make it up and actually reach that place\nAnd find a woman that you love and give her your last name\nYou‚Äôll feel the things that you provide is only why she stays\nAnd when you try to explain you‚Äôll say‚Ä¶\n \nI can‚Äôt hide myself\nI don‚Äôt expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it‚Äôs like to be a man\nIt‚Äôs a lonely road and they don‚Äôt care about what you know\nIt‚Äôs not bout how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nDon‚Äôt give up, keep fightin‚Äô\nAs a man our son(sun) is our horizon\nAnd our father‚Äôs actions play a role\nAnd we end up like ‚Äòem\nSo they can‚Äôt let us see them hurt\n‚ÄòCause we‚Äôll embody what they do\nAnd start a generational curse\n No wonder most men are so depressed\nAll the things that they can‚Äôt express\nThey go to war \nget thrown on the shelf\nThen go back to war with their mental health\nThen grab that bottle and ask for help\nTry to pull themselves out of h*ll\nThen fall back down and then realize that they gon‚Äô have to do it themselves\n \nIt‚Äôs the circle of life\nAs a man you provide\nThey don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre worth ‚Äòtil the day that you die\nAnd that‚Äôs when they start cryin‚Äô\nThen move on to a man to confide in\n \nThat‚Äôs why we feel\nWe can‚Äôt hide ourselves\nWe don‚Äôt expect you to understand\nWe just hope we can explain\nWhat it‚Äôs like to be a man\nIt‚Äôs a lonely road and you don‚Äôt care about what we know\nIt‚Äôs not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n \nThat home\nIt‚Äôs not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. TBH this is the most excited I've ever felt about a song.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread and create healthy conversation. I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout life. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world.

In this video, we finish our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support this potentially history-altering theory.\n\nMY SOCIALS:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/miniminuteman/\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@miniminuteman\nE-Mail (Business inquiries only.

The battle, which was fought between British and French forces versus German forces, kicked off on July 1, 1916, and ended on November 18 that same year.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\nMusic video was produced by Video Ink Ltd. https://www.videoink.co.uk\n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.","title":"SABATON - 1916 (Official Music Video)","duration":454,"channel_id":"UCjQhd1APsd5NQhiVZV7GYzg","author":"Sabaton","date":"20230414","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgGhhnQB1gw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HgGhhnQB1gw/hqdefault.webp?v=6433c014","content":{"View count":604326}}
{"description":"Gordon Murray's astonishing ¬£2.8m T.50 is a 963kg, 654bhp three-seater that aims to right the wrongs of the McLaren F1. Not that it was famed for many. But 969 days after we got our first proper look at it, Gordon has given the car his official stamp of approval to bring development to a close, meaning we could finally have a go in it. \n\nNow, we don‚Äôt normally do passenger rides at Top Gear, but when three-time Indy 500 winner Dario Franchitti gives you a ring to ask if you want a lift, you don‚Äôt say no. Especially when it involves some flat-out runs so we can hear that naturally aspirated V12 scream as he works the six-speed manual gearbox. And ‚Äì best of all ‚Äì as it's a three-seater, it meant both Top Gear Magazine‚Äôs Jack Rix and Ollie Marriage could both have a go.

In the late 1950s, Air Force planners were confident that the advent of powerful new radars and long-range air-to-air missiles had rendered close-range aerial combat a thing of the past. So fighter jets like venerable the Mcdonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom were not engineered to be light or agile like their predecessors. Instead, they were designed to be heavily-loaded with missiles and carry powerful radars. Their pilots were no longer trained to dogfight, as they would engage the enemy at great distances, well beyond visual range. \n\nBut in the Vietnam War, military planners learned the hard way that the age of dogfighting was far from over. American pilots were being downed at alarming rates. The Friend or Foe (IFF) systems designed to identify enemy targets proved unreliable, forcing Air Force pilots to get in close to visually identify targets. At close-range, up against more agile Soviet-built MiGs, the F-4s were at a disadvantage. They were less agile than the MiGs, lacked a gun for close-range combat, and their pilots weren‚Äôt properly trained. To make matters worse, 1967, the Soviet Union looked set to unveil what appeared to be a new super-fighter built for extreme maneuverability. \n\nThe devastating experience from Vietnam and concerns being outclassed in the skies pushed the United States to develop a new air-superiority fighter that could face off with any current or future Soviet-built fighter. The result would be a twin-engine, high-performance, all-weather air superiority fighter known for its incredible acceleration and agility. Engineered from the ground up for tactical dominance in any air space, the F-15 holds the distinction of over a hundred aerial victories without a single defeat. \n\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\n\nIntro Song:  ‚ÄòRequiem for Humanity Alternate‚Äô- https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/CEZ_CET_9065\n\nSong 1: ‚ÄòThe Final Warning‚Äô - https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/MYMA_JUST_0234\n\nSong 2: ‚ÄòWeapon of Choice‚Äô -  https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/JL2Rr4Yi1B/\n\nSong 3: ‚ÄòInfiltration And Investigation‚Äô - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/141553842-infiltration-and-investigationdark-suspense-infiltration-sce\n\nSong 4: ‚ÄòSomething Is Coming‚Äô - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/102107772-b-lynne-something-coming-no-legato-strings-orchestra-epic-su\n\nSong 5: ‚Äò80s Glam Rock‚Äô - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-glam-rock/32401699\n\nSong 6: ‚ÄòBaliachi‚Äô - https://www.apmmusic.com/albums/CEZ_CEZ_4256\n\nSong 7: ‚Äò80'S Dark Synthwave‚Äô - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/53759123-80s-dark-synthwave\n\nSong 8: ‚ÄòViking Tension‚Äô - https://audiojungle.net/item/viking-tension/40074535\n\nSong 9: ‚ÄòSynthwave Technology Industrial‚Äô - https://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave-technology-industrial/35272023\n\nThanks for watching!","title":"How Panic Created The Best Fighter Jet Ever: The F-15 Eagle","duration":861,"channel_id":"UC1ZBQ-F-yktYD4m5AzM6pww","author":"Mustard","date":"20230413","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmlWmDokzGg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RmlWmDokzGg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1525526}}
