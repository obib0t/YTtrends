{"description":"In Theaters December 22nd\n\nFrom director Andrew Haigh. One night in his near-empty tower block in contemporary London, Adam (Andrew Scott) has a chance encounter with a mysterious neighbor Harry (Paul Mescal), which punctures the rhythm of his everyday life.

{"description":"Pre-order UFC 5 Deluxe Edition: http://x.ea.com/77815\n\nWhat makes an MMA fight? It‚Äôs the stakes, technique, drama, and pure reality of the moment. UFC 5 captures that in more authentic detail than ever before, from next-generation graphics upgrades that give gameplay animations new life, damage systems that marry the brutality and strategy of the fight game, gameplay updates that make the action feel even more fluid and realistic, and much more.\n\nIntroducing Authentic Damage in UFC 5: Cuts, bruising, and swelling accumulate in accurate locations based on the damage you inflict and take in-game, including over 64,000 possible combinations of facial damage a fighter can sustain. All damage is now rendered in more detail than ever before, affecting character attributes in a truly genuine fashion. Authentic damage adds a whole new layer of strategic possibilities to the fight. \n\nAuthentic damage comes with authentic results. If the player sustains a significant injury ‚Äî like a broken nose or swollen eye ‚Äî the ref can now step in, pause the action, and get the ringside doctor to inspect the damage. \n\nIt‚Äôs a striking evolution. UFC 5 features all-new animations for ground and pound elbows, spinning attacks, and several other punches, kicks, knees, and elbows. Plus, new striking animations emulate heavy hitters, professional kickboxers, and more, giving you all new ways to stand and bang. In addition, new hit reaction animations and physics make sure you feel the impact of a clean connection.\n\n\nThe new Seamless Submissions functions as a revamped extension of the existing grappling systems with faster animations and the removal of mini-games. Beginners can use Grapple Assist for help on the canvas, while veterans will have new depths to uncover and enjoy. The new submissions offer a smoother, more authentic ground game that is sure to be a grappler‚Äôs delight.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more UFC 5 Trailers: bit.ly/easports_ufc\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsufc \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsufc \nTwitter: https://x.com/easportsufc \n\n\n#UFC5 #Gameplay","title":"UFC 5 Official Gameplay Trailer | Deep Dive ft.

{"description":"Florida was once the iconic swing state. What happened?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nIn 2022, before he began a campaign for the presidency, Ron DeSantis was reelected governor of Florida in a landslide. This was impressive and surprising because the 2022 elections were disappointing for Republicans almost everywhere else in the US. But DeSantis‚Äôs overwhelming victory was doubly impressive and surprising because when he had first been elected, just four years earlier, it was by just a tiny margin.\n\nFor a long time, in fact, tiny election margins were the norm in Florida elections. Florida was a ‚Äúswing state‚Äù ‚Äî it sometimes voted for Democrats, sometimes for Republicans, and was a major prize up for grabs in presidential elections. But by 2022, something had changed: Florida Republicans up and down the ballot won their races by margins similar to DeSantis‚Äôs, and no one was calling Florida a swing state anymore.\n\nFlorida seems to have undergone a political transformation. So what happened? In this video, we look at three possible explanations.\n\nChapters: \n0:00 What changed?\n1:49 Defining the question\n2:52 New Floridians\n4:10 Latino voters\n7:05 Florida Democrats\n8:26 The other reasons\n10:09 A request\n\nRead ‚ÄúThe United States of Florida,‚Äù a contributor-supported project from Vox: https://www.vox.com/culture/23864468/florida-man-invasive-species-republican-disney-publix-miami\n\nWe looked at ‚Ä¶. a lot of data for this video. Here are the main sources we used:\n\nCounty-by-county results in Florida elections from 2016-2022 came from the Florida Department of State‚Äôs Election Reporting System: https://results.elections.myflorida.com/\n\nThe screenshotted US Census page showing that Miami-Dade is mostly Latino can be found here, under the ‚Äúdata tables‚Äù tab: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html\n\nOur map showing the ‚Äúspecific origin‚Äù of various states‚Äô Latino populations was inspired by the University of Washington‚Äôs Great Migrations Project: https://depts.washington.edu/moving1/map_latinx_migration.shtml\n\nThe data we used for that map came from the US Census via this very helpful tool: https://data.census.gov/table?q=B03001:+HISPANIC+OR+LATINO+ORIGIN+BY+SPECIFIC+ORIGIN\n\nThe chart about Spanish-language ad spending in the 2022 Florida governor‚Äôs race came from a post-mortem of the 2022 election by the research firm Equis. You can find it on page 59: https://weareequis.us/api/docs/qV8T7OpIWxw54fYWr9F0M/d1ecc7309b286d6b7db60d7f140f3b4f/2022_Post-Mortem_June_14.pdf\n\nAnd now for the big red bars. The Florida state party expenditures came from Transparency USA, an organization that tracks state-level campaign finance data. That data for Florida Republicans is here: https://www.transparencyusa.org/fl/committee/republican-party-of-florida-4700-pty\nAnd Democratic state party expenditures are here: https://www.transparencyusa.org/fl/committee/florida-democratic-party-1539-pty\n\nThe data on the best-funded state parties is from OpenSecrets, another org that tracks campaign finance data: https://www.opensecrets.org/political-parties/top-committees?cycle=2022&party=A&type=R\n\nThe chart at the end, which compiles spending from the national Democratic Party, was also based on information from OpenSecrets: https://www.opensecrets.org/political-parties\n\nAnd the data on how much the state parties raised came from Florida Department of State‚Äôs campaign finance database: https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/campaign-finance/contributions/\n\nThe line chart that shows total voter registrations for each party is based on data that Florida‚Äôs Division of Elections makes public: https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-reports/voter-registration-by-party-affiliation/\n\nFinally, the data around voters who moved to a new state and new Florida registrations from 2020-2023 came from the data vendor L2: https://www.l2datamapping.com/\n\nVox is an explanatory newsroom on a mission to help everyone understand our weird, wonderful, complicated world, so that we can all help shape it.

{"description":"Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances ‚Äì either side if the interval ‚Äì and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.
