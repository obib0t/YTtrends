{"description":"Colleton County Sheriff's Detectives Laura Rutland, Daniel Greene and Jason Chapman were among the first on the scene the night of June 7, 2021, after Alex Murdaugh murdered his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul. \nWhile it was almost unthinkable in the first few hours after the killings, these detectives said they picked up right away on things that weren't adding up -- primarily focusing on Murdaugh's demeanor, emotions and body language. Plus, the detectives respond to rampant criticism of investigators throughout the trial, saying some of the complaints against them were far from fair or reasonable. \n\nJoin hosts Anne Emerson, Charlie Condon and Drew Tripp as they discuss the new details learned from this exclusive interview.\n\nWant to hear more from the Colleton County investigators?

{"description":"This woolly guy isn‚Äôt sheepish when it comes to bringing in more Cult of the Lamb followers. He can‚Äôt be: whenever The Lamb leaves camp, the goal is always to bring back at least one more Cult of the Lamb follower. It‚Äôs doubly important when your one true love can leave this world at a moment‚Äôs notice. Of course‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when you just quickly have yourself a Cult of the Lamb marriage. Look, when you‚Äôve got the power, you can pretty much do what you want.\n\nThe thing is that some supporters can turn nasty when they think your Cult of the Lamb is poop. They might just start calling it Cult of the Lamb Poop‚Ä¶ and then want to eat poop and‚Ä¶ it becomes a whole thing. Then you‚Äôve got yourself a Cult of the Lamb dissenter, and no one needs that; not I, not ewe.

{"description":"Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken - In Theaters This Summer\n\nSometimes the hero you are meant to be lies just beneath the surface. \n\nThis summer, DreamWorks Animation dives into the turbulent waters of high school with a hilarious, heartfelt action comedy about a shy teenager who discovers that she‚Äôs part of a legendary royal lineage of mythical sea krakens and that her destiny, in the depths of the oceans, is bigger than she ever dreamed. \n\nSweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I‚Äôve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. \n\nShe‚Äôs math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she‚Äôs prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar¬Æ nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. \n\nBut when she breaks her mom‚Äôs #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award¬Æ winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. \n\nThe Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There‚Äôs one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school‚Äôs beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt‚Äôs Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most. \n\nRuby Gillman, Teenage Kraken stars an extraordinary cast that includes Emmy winner Colman Domingo (Fear the Walking Dead) as Ruby‚Äôs supportive dad, Emmy nominee Sam Richardson (Veep) as Ruby‚Äôs enthusiastic uncle and Blue Chapman (Council of Dads) as Ruby‚Äôs cool little brother. \n\nDirected by Academy Award¬Æ nominated filmmaker Kirk DeMicco (Vivo, The Croods) and produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella (Trolls World Tour, Trolls), with Faryn Pearl (The Croods: A New Age, Trolls World Tour) serving as co-director, the film features a comedic powerhouse supporting cast, including Emmy nominee Will Forte (The Last Man on Earth), Emmy nominee Nicole Byer (Nailed It!), YouTube Diamond creator Liza Koshy (Liza on Demand), Ramona Young (Never Have I Ever), Eduardo Franco (Stranger Things) and Echo Kellum (Arrow). \n\nSocial Handles\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/teenagekrakenmovie  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/teenagekrakenmovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.teenagekrakenmovie.com \n#TeenageKrakenMovie","title":"RUBY GILLMAN, TEENAGE KRAKEN | Official Trailer","duration":144,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230316","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAMKwDsfUeU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iAMKwDsfUeU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1342536}}

{"description":"Nice to see Coruscant again.\nFelt the ep dragged on too long with Pershing\nMando and Bo Katan are fun, Bo has ulterior motives to control the Mythosaur and rule Mandalore. \n\nAt pershing‚Äôs day job he tires to salvage some files from the empire that come across his desk, but he‚Äôs told to not do that and discard it. He thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous as the information can really help the new republic, but they simply refuse to do so. He‚Äôs getting angry at the new republic and beginning to resent them for sure. He grabs an imperial biscuit and we jump to him being questioned again by the robot with the same mundane questions. At the question of whether or not is he feeling resentment towards the new republic or not, he pauses, looks down, and rubs his ear. The same ear he rubbed when talking to the people in the opera chambers that he didn‚Äôt mean to do anything bad when working at the empire. The robot repeats itself, and he says no. Heading to G68 he says let‚Äôs continue the cloning work, and asks for her help to get the lab equipment. Immediately the plagueis theme plays and this is probably the biggest part of the episode for me, because it implies the ominous tone of palpatine telling anakin about plagueis in the opera. Does this mean they‚Äôll bring plagueis back in star wars? Does this mean that it‚Äôs just a cool theme that‚Äôs supposed to make us think of betrayal and deceit? I guess we‚Äôll find out.\nthey head to the train station and get to the scrapyards where the imperial star destroyers are held. This takes about 7 minutes of hopping trams to avoid ticket droid guards. Arriving at the junkyard‚Ä¶That‚Äôs where she‚Äôs taking him, to collect supplies from the ship, they enter and she introduces herself as Elia, and he as Dr Penn Pershing. Pershing gets to the imperial lab, grabbing what he needs, they hear a noise and vacate, only to be stopped by new republic police, where she grabs the case he just took from the ship for their mission, and gets him arrested. She set him up, framed him, and next we see him with some Mon Calamaris as he screams to them it was a trap, harkening to of course, admiral ackbar‚Äôs infamous line in return of the jedi. They set Pershing up to a mind flayer machine and the mon cala operator says it‚Äôs low voltage and not like a mind flayer, infact it‚Äôs used to heal, he says. Elia waits until the crew leaves as they turn the mind flayer on, and she cranks it up high, which erases his mind and memory. \n\nFinally getting back to Mando, they head to the armorer and the children of the watch where they‚Äôre hiding. Din tells Bo Katan to keep her helmet on as things will go smoother this way, since the clans have different beliefs. As they land, we see Paz Vizsla, who wanted to rule mandalore as he fought mando for it in the book of boba fett, losing, seems to be teeming with anger as he sees him land and bo katan with him. The history between Bo Katan and Pre Vizsla can be summed up like this. Bo and Pre Vizsla worked together under Death Watch, who believed that New Mandalorians \n\nlost their way of violence and conquering which was the way of the older mandalorians, so they waged civil war, until Bo felt he was a bit too crazy and left his group, rebelling against him. Paz Vizsla probalby sees her as a traitor and hates her.\nThe are approached by all the mandos there and Paz leads, telling them to leave as Din is no longer worthy of the mandalorian creed. He informs Paz Vizsla that he‚Äôs bathed in the living waters beneath the mines, as no one believes him. Bo Katan speaks up and says she was witness. And who are you, nite owl, says paz. Nite owls are just a faction of mandalorians led by bo katan after she left pre vizsla for his extremist ideologies. She announces who she is and he tells her that she‚Äôs lost her way, and both need to leave as they are apostates. Mando shows proof, so they send him up to the armorer, their leader, as she examines the vial of water sampled from the mines, and confirms indeed he has bathed in the waters, he is once again a mandalorian.\nShe says she too has joined the children of the watch since she bathed in the waters and hasn‚Äôt removed her helmet. I find it intersting the armorer knew right away that it was Bo Katan, this is very telling‚Ä¶that maybe the armorer knows who Bo is personally. Maybe the armorer, with her spikes on her head, or rather horns, was a member of the mauldalorians when darth maul ruled mandalore. I think she might be Rook Kast, who was loyal to Maul after he defeated her former leader, pre vizsla and organized the mandalorians against Ahsoka during the siege of Mandalore. That‚Äôd be wild since Bo and Ahsoka are friends and allies, and Rook Kast and Bo Katan are not. We‚Äôll see who the armorer really is one day‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/realswtheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Episode 3 BREAKDOWN PLAGUEIS!

To land on the helipad, 27m in diameter, he completed over 650 practice landings before the attempt on top of the 56-story hotel. He needed just 20.76 meters to stop. To make the feat possible he and a team of CubCrafters engineers along with renowned American aviation engineer and aircraft builder Mike Patey made a number of modifications to the aircraft, reducing the total weight to only 425 kilograms, moving the main fuel tank to the rear of the plane to allow for more aggressive braking and adding nitrous to enhance power for Czepiela‚Äôs secondary challenge ‚Äì taking off from the helipad.\n\nTake flight with Luke and see even more from the landing here: https://www.redbull.com/bullseye-landing\n\n#RedBull #GivesYouWiiings #plane \n_________________________________________________\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before with the best action sports clips on the web, original series and livestreams.\n\nGet the FREE Red Bull TV apps for all your devices: http://win.gs/RedBullTVApps  \nSubscribe to Red Bull on Youtube: http://win.gs/SubToRedBull\nCheck out Red Bull on TikTok: https://win.gs/TikTok\nRed Bull on Facebook: http://win.gs/redbullfb\nRed Bull on Instagram: http://win.gs/RedBullInstagram\nRed Bull on Twitter: http://win.gs/redbulltwitter","title":"Landing A Plane On A Tiny Helipad (on top of a 7 Star hotel)","duration":133,"channel_id":"UCblfuW_4rakIf2h6aqANefA","author":"Red Bull","date":"20230314","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-brmk1ua1g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/B-brmk1ua1g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1051710}}

{"description":"Governments are rushing to reassure citizens that their money is safe, after the US saw its biggest banking collapse since the global financial crisis. Silicon Valley Bank's demise was closely followed by that of New York-based Signature Bank. The US insists a repeat of 2008 is not on the cards - but how contagious could the problems be?\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg released a joint statement Sunday that they will complete the resolution of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) whilst protecting depositors.\n\n\"Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThe reason authorities believe the taxpayer will incur no cost is that authorities administrating the bank will be able to use its remaining assets to cover the costs of reimbursing depositors.\n\nThe same will also apply to Signature Bank. On Sunday, the New York State Chartering Authority closed down the cryptocurrency-exposed lender that had lost around a third of its share price value in the second half of the week. \n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters on Sunday that he would speak at more length on the issue early on Monday.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#US #bankfailure #USregulators","title":"As another bank collapses, US regulators race to prevent spread of crisis I DW News","duration":475,"channel_id":"UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg","author":"DW News","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0Ilm230bf8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a0Ilm230bf8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":931514}}

First up though I wanna thank everyone for rocking with me the last 9 weeks and we're sort of like Joel and Ellie a bit because I'd doom the entire human race just to get a thumbs up from you.\n\nAnyway we start off the episode with a flashback and this features a major game cameo. Out in the woods we join a pregnant woman running and this is none other than Ashley Johnson. Ashley voiced Ellie in the game and here we catch her playing her mother. So far several big actors from the game have popped up including Tommy's voice actor as Perry, Troy Baker as James last week and Marlene's who shows up later on in this scene.\n\nEllies mother is called Anna and she was first mentioned in the last of us comic American Dreams.\n\nThis featured Ellie and Riley and in it we learned a little bit about Anna and what she did before the outbreak.\n\nAnna worked as a nurse before the outbreak and we know that she and her lifelong friend Marlene survived together when everything went down worse than this channels views next week.\n\nAll that we learned from the backstroy was that she died within a day of giving birth to Ellie but here we see it fleshed out with her running to a farmhouse being chased by an infected person. We can see a big symbol for the fireflies denoting that this is a safehouse and you can also catch what I'm guessing is the Boston QZ in the background. As we know this was controlled by Fedra and though we don't learn why Anna's out on her own like this it likely has something to do with the infected.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":3025,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2-Egs56y_I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2-Egs56y_I/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":376707}}
