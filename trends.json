{"description":"Croatia and Brazil faced off in the Quarterfinals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The first half was a slow one, as both teams seemed to be feeling each other out. Brazil got a couple of shots on goal but nothing went through. The second half was more of the same with multiple Brazilian shots on goal but nothing would go through. That would all change in extra time when Neymar would put the team on his back and scored in 105‚Äô + 1‚Äô. Croatia said not so fast and evened up the score Bruno Petkoviƒá scored in 117‚Äô. Croatia would go on to win in PKs and would advance.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Croatia #Brazil \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n‚ñ∫PBC ON FOX‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n‚ñ∫WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n‚ñ∫NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n‚ñ∫CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer‚Äôs YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

\nThis the game plan \nSit back and pay attention  \nThis is how the games ran \n\nI had to switch up the pace  \nI had to build up my name  \nYuh  \nI had to make up a way  \nNow they all ridin‚Äô my wave  \nHuh  \n\nHooked top of my class \nHidden gems among treasures \nAccumulated these plaques \nWe wrote a million letters  \n\nDon‚Äôt you worry about a thing  \nCome follow our lead now  \n\nWe got you, we got you \n\nMake a faulty move started losing out  \n\nTogether the more we get done  \nQuicker the outcome the sum  \nObstacles hang in the way of the prize together we all going to rise\nPeaking now  \nSo close to the top  \nI can almost see and reach the clouds  \nThis the beginning let ‚Äòem all find out\n\nHolding onto distant recollections \nI‚Äôve been waiting for this day to play this  \n\nBeen making some changes had to get it all aligned \nuh uh \nHad to sacrifice my nights to get up on ahead \nuh uh \n\nJust hold it in to the end  \nIt makes a difference when you started from the bottom and just barely hit the ceiling  \n\n321 \n\nHold it down  \nSit back and watch the team  \nHold it down  \nThis isn‚Äôt on the screens\nWorld in my palms feel the bass \nThis the contrary  \n\nWere weary  \nWe‚Äôre ready  \n\nI‚Äôm solo \nAin‚Äôt no secrets now \nBeen on my own  \nOn the brink of geeking out \nThis is the pinnacle  \nNo contradiction though  \nWe‚Äôre not ordinary  \n\nSo divine  \nI had to check if it was real \nOverdue in time \nCatching up with a future self  \n\nFull throttle, full throttle  \nGotta make this last forever  \nThe motto, this the motto  \nWork hard to make your future better \n\nMy heart is bleeding from the pain that I put my own self through  \nThere‚Äôs no need for introductions or greetings it‚Äôs old news  \n\nI‚Äôll admit it, I‚Äôll admit it, it was kind of scary  \nI had to bury all my demons like the mortuary  \n\nHolding onto distant recollections \nI‚Äôve been waiting for this day to play this  \n\nBeen making some changes had to get it all aligned \nuh uh \nHad to sacrifice my nights to get up on ahead \nuh uh \n\nJust hold it in to the end  \nIt makes a difference when you started from the bottom and just barely hit the ceiling \n\nHold it down  \nSit back and watch the team   \nHold it down  \nThis isn‚Äôt on the screens  \nWorld in my palms feel the bass \nThis the contrary  \n\nWere weary  \nWe‚Äôre ready  \n\nFrom the start of all time  \nWe all been gifted \nYou gotta count all of your blessings \nTo get in frame \nYou riding  \nI‚Äôm guiding  \nAnd we will maintain  \nLiving in a paradox we all must grip and hold on \n\nHold on  \nWhen it‚Äôs going down  \n\nWho‚Äôs gon have your back and hold it down when no one is around  \n\nLaunch pad  \nTaking off

The second half was even more of a defensive struggle, with both teams managing to hold each other in check. They would head to extra time at 0-0. While both teams had multiple chances on goal, no-one scored and we would go to PKs.

{"description":"A summary of the challenges with starting a grid back up from total collapse.\nü•ë For 18 FREE meals with HelloFresh plus free shipping, use code PRACTICAL18 at https://bit.ly/3UQECxk!\n\nThe grid is a little bit of a house of cards. It‚Äôs not necessarily flimsy, but if the whole thing gets knocked down, you have to rebuild it one card at a time and from the ground up. Restoring power after a major blackout is one of the most high stakes operations you can imagine. The consequences of messing it up are enormous, but there‚Äôs no way to practice a real-life scenario. It seems as simple as flipping a switch, but restoring power is more complicated than you might think.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Wanderer (Scaramouche) IS FINALLY HERE!!! This video covers a massive showcase, optimal Wanderer build guide & my thoughts about him!\n\n In this video I cover almost everything you need to know in this Wanderer Showcase video - I went through many, MANY different Wanderer weapons and artifacts, tested about 10 different Wanderer builds, checked how good is Wanderer DPS and ultimately - I want to present you this video as one stop solution to decide if Wanderer is worth it.\n\nIn addition to this, I've tested about 6 different best Wanderer teams, examined what Wanderer skills can do and even dug deep into how much investment Wanderer needs. You'll also see things like popular Wanderer + Faruzan team showcased, popular variation of Hyper Wanderer, Wanderer damage going really well using Dodoco Tales weapon catalyst and MORE.\n\n0:00 What you can expect from this video\n0:10 Damage Potential & Skills Showcase \n5:50 Wandere Showcase, Teams & Builds\n10:07 Overall Thoughts, Should You Pull Wanderer?\n\nWanderer also known as Scaramouche was released during 3.3 Genshin Impact update.\n\nGenshin Impact is an open-world gacha game that's available on PC, PS4, PS5 and mobile devices (iOS & Android).

{"description":"Explosions have reportedly hit a Russian airbase far from the Ukrainian border, damaging two long-range bombers. Unverified videos of the blasts have been posted on a variety of Telegram channels. \nThe blasts early Monday struck the airbase near the city of Engels, more than 600 kilometers inside Russian territory. The bombers damaged are said to be of the same type used to carry out airstrikes on Ukraine's infrastructure. Another explosion hit a military base near the Russian city of Ryazan. At least three people were reportedly killed after a fuel tank exploded. So far there has been no claim of responsibility for either of the blasts.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n#Russia #Ukraine #UkraineWar","title":"Explosions hit military bases deep within Russian territory | DW News","duration":285,"channel_id":"UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg","author":"DW News","date":"20221205","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFug2Wf3DcU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/UFug2Wf3DcU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2384733}}
