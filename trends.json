{"description":"Bobby Carter | August 8, 2023\nThere are times during Action Bronson's Tiny Desk when his vocals momentarily drift. We instruct our guests to face the directional microphones so that our recorders clearly pick up the voices. Action warned us of the improbability of that happening before we started filming and sure enough, the Flushing, Queens emcee strolled off mic a couple of times, did an about face here and there and even took a knee mid-show. By the time we got to \"Latin Grammys,\" he looked over to our engineer Josh Rogosin and said, \"I told you I couldn't stand still. How do you play music still?\" He's got a point.\n\nAction's band Human Growth Hormone reinterprets his records so funky, it's nearly impossible not to move, yet the small imperfections during the set tickled me. Bam Bam, primarily known as a rapper, has turned his passion for food, clothing, sneakers, wrestling, writing, fitness and painting into bonafide professions. Never veering too far away from the booth, he's consistently dropped projects since 2011. After working out in the green room, Mr. Baklava walked to the Desk, greeting nearly every person in the room with a handshake, and proceeded to perform highlights from Mr. Wonderful, Lamb Over Rice, White Bronco, and Only For Dolphins. Bronson was born to entertain us.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Dmtri\"\n\"Live from the Moon\"\n\"Latin Grammys\"\n\"Terry\"\n\"Baby Blue\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAction Bronson: vocals, effects\nMatt \"Yung Mehico\" Carrillo: keys, saxophone\nNicholas Coleman: bass\nWahkiba \"9Ether\" Julion: drums\nRed Walrus: percussion\nJulian Love: guitar\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #actionbronson","title":"Action Bronson: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1673,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230808","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUN8pdgA0m8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CUN8pdgA0m8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":596330}}

{"description":"Welcome to brotato the world's premier roguelike dungeon crawling adventure where you play as a potato that must survive endless waves of enemies and each round improve your potato with weapons, stats and abilities. Today my plan is simple to prove if brotato is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the ability to become god is exactly what the developers intended! Brotato is a top-down arena shooter roguelite where you play a potato wielding up to 6 weapons at a time to fight off hordes of aliens. Choose from a variety of traits and items to create unique builds and survive until help arrives.\n\nOur build is going to be exploiting trees and the luck statistics to generate more upgrades than the game realistically expects and the luck stat ensures they are likely unique or legendary upgrades. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nBROTATO CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 - Coming up...\n00:07 - Welcome to BROTATO\n01:01 - Waves 1  - 20\n15:44 - Waves 21 - 29\n23:52 - Waves 40 - 49\n26:23 - THE FINAL WAVE: WAVE 50\n27:53 - Thank you and goodbye!\n\nTitle: I Became A God in BROTATO - A perfectly balanced game with no exploits\n\n#game #brotato #god","title":"I Became A GOD in BROTATO - A Perfectly Balanced Game with no exploits","duration":1704,"channel_id":"UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ","author":"The Spiffing Brit","date":"20230807","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaw3jLuIQ28","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iaw3jLuIQ28/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":545602}}

{"description":"Thanks to everyone for joining us for this race: \n- Red Bull: @redbullracing \n- Rimac: https://www.instagram.com/rimac_automobili/\n- McMurtry: https://www.instagram.com/mcmurtryautomotive/\n\nGet ready for the most exciting drag race in carwow history! \n\nWe’ve got the World Championship-winning Red Bull RB8 going up against the 1,914hp Rimac Nevera and the Goodwood Hillclimb record-holding McMurtry Spéirling!\n\nSo let’s see how these marvellous machines compare. Starting with the Rimac, it’s equipped with four electric motors that can produce an eye-watering 1,914hp and 2,360Nm of torque. It’s packing a 120kWh battery pack, so as a result it’s pretty heavy, tipping the scales at around 2,300kg. And as you can imagine, all of that power doesn’t come cheap, with the Nevera costing around £2,000,000! \n\nAlongside it we have the McMurtry. This single-seater EV is a whole lot lighter than the Rimac, weighing in at just 1,000kg. It’s also equipped with two electric motors that produce around 1,000hp, while also packing an incredible fan system that helps to generate 2,000kg of downforce! As a result, it can shoot off from the line like nothing you’ve ever seen before! But there’s a catch - it’s limited to a top speed of only 150mph...\n\nThen finally we have the F1 car, driven by Red Bull’s reserve driver, Liam Lawson. He’s driving Sebastian Vettel’s Championship-winning RB8, which is equipped with a 2.4-litre V8 that can produce 800hp. It’s easily the lightest car here, at around 700kg, and all power is sent to the rear wheels only. \n\nSo it’s an absolutely incredible line-up, but will electric power triumph?! Or will the F1 car prove victorious? There’s only one way to find out for sure… LET’S RACE!\n\nMcMurtry Spéirling review & 1/4-mile: https://bit.ly/-McMurtry-Speirling-Review\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"F1 Car vs World's FASTEST Hypercars: DRAG RACE","duration":882,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230805","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCzCqqVGQYE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PCzCqqVGQYE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3786590}}

{"description":"The Real Reason Why Jimmy Uso Betrayed Jey Uso at WWE SummerSlam\n\nSummerSlam just came to a shocking end. Roman Reigns retained his WWE championship, but I don’t think anybody expected it happen like this. After a hard-fought battle, it looked like main event Jey Uso was going to win the world championship. It seemed like a perfect ending to The Bloodline story. After a big-time splash, Jey went for the pin. \n\nThe referee nearly counted three until a man with a hoodie pulled Jey Uso out of the ring. We come to find out that it’s his brother. Jimmy Uso returned and cost his brother the championship match. He then hit him with a superkick and sent him back in the ring to take one final spear that ended the match. \n\nRoman Reigns even looked shocked, so this wasn’t planned by him or Paul Heyman. Jimmy Uso came out to screw over his brother for a certain reason. What is that reason? Well, here’s the real reason why Jimmy Uso returned to betray his brother.\n\n#WWE #SummerSlam \n\nCan we REACH 5000 likes?\n\n►Help Me Reach 500K Subscribers - http://goo.gl/e0xMwh\n►My Twitter - https://twitter.com/valonpllana\n►My Instagram - https://instagram.com/valon.pllana\n\nFor copyright purposes, please email: business.pllana@gmail.com\n\n*Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Furnace insulation stops heat being lost from the walls of a furnace and so increases the heat within the furnace. Dry wood ash makes an excellent insulator for heat as the fine particles separated by small air gaps don't allow heat to conduct very well. To make the furnace a double layered wall of clay was made and the space between was filled with wood ash from different fires. The clay needed to be completely dry before doing so however as it was important the the ash not get wet, which would cause it to loose its insulating properties.The furnace was tested with an iron smelt and it produced 34g of iron from 10 charges of ore. It was going quickly to start with but then I had issues with the blower towards the end of the smelt (broken housing). The furnace design is promising though as this produced the third best smelt I've done in the wild with natural tools and materials (the best were 39g and 41g over a year ago). I'll try it again later when I've replaced the broken forge blower. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #woodfurnace #furnace","title":"Primitive Technology: Wood Ash Insulated Furnace","duration":919,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230803","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTzMqWaoqYw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XTzMqWaoqYw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1196611}}
