{"description":"Speculation has been swirling since former Chinese President Hu Jintao was escorted out from the closing session of China’s twice a decade Communist Party’s Congress on Saturday (Oct 22), which saw Mr Hu's successor, Xi Jinping secure an unprecedented third term at the helm. \n\nCNA’s cameras captured the moments just prior to Mr Hu's departure, which took place soon after local and foreign media were allowed to enter the auditorium to cover proceedings around 11.15am. It came shortly after Chinese state media announced that delegates had elected a new Central Committee and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which media were not allowed into the hall to witness. \n\nCurrent chairman of China's legislature Li Zhanshu is seen taking papers out of Mr Hu's hand, before a man comes to speak to him and escorts him out. READ: https://cna.asia/3TwGKK7\n\nFollowing Mr Hu’s departure, proceedings continued with delegates voting on other items on the agenda including an amendment to the party’s constitution. Addressing the incident later that night, Chinese state media attributed the incident to health reasons. In a tweet written in English, Xinhua said that Mr Hu was “not feeling well” during the session and for his health, staff had accompanied to a room next to the meeting venue “for a rest”. Mr Hu's name was censored from Chinese social media.\n\nREAD MORE: https://cna.asia/3z7jDNS\n\nSubscribe to our channel here: https://cna.asia/youtubesub \n\nSubscribe to our news service on Telegram: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\nFollow us:\nCNA: https://cna.asia\nCNA Lifestyle: http://www.cnalifestyle.com \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@channelnewsasia","title":"Exclusive: What happened before former Chinese President Hu Jintao was escorted out of Congress?","duration":176,"channel_id":"UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg","author":"CNA","date":"20221024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBG2bD-TE9g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZBG2bD-TE9g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1121989}}

{"description":"New Jersey is the only state in the U.S. that doesn’t allow customers to pump their own gas — anywhere. There’s always an attendant on duty to pump gas for customers at these full-service stations.\n\nOregon is the only other state besides New Jersey with a full-service law. However, Oregon’s laws are far less strict and allow certain parts of the state to have self-service gas stations.\n\n“It goes back to the middle of the 20th century,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth Polling Institute. “There were forces involved who wanted to protect their interests in terms of the smaller gas owners against mega gas stations that were starting to be built at the time that would require self-service to be profitable.”\n\nHistorically, gas stations with attendants were popular in the first half of the 1900s. But by the 1970s, most states had switched over to customers pumping their own gas. As these changes swept the U.S., a state ban on self-service in 1949, known as the Retail Gasoline Dispensing Safety Act, stopped the Garden State from following suit. Oregon passed its own similar law in 1951.\nIn the original bill, the New Jersey state legislature cited safety concerns and rising costs to consumers as reasons to not transition over to self-service. But every time there’s a spike in gas prices, bills opposing full service start to pop up. Seen as a ‘political third rail’ by many politicians including Gov. Phil Murphy, it’s one of the few legislative debates that doesn’t follow party lines. Every bill has failed so far, but it hasn’t stopped self-serve advocacy groups and politicians from pushing for change.\n\nWatch the video above to find out more about New Jersey’s full-service gas stations, why self-service options don’t find a home in the Garden State, and what’s next for its gas station owners.\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

{"description":"If you thought the \"Alphabet Lore\" story felt unfinished... you were right. When I started these as daily exercises, I planned 28 videos for the 28 days of February (with Y, n, Z,  + \"Epilogue\" being the final four). \n\nI knew this one would take a while, so I uploaded the A-Z(...) Compilation in the meantime, and planned to quietly replace it with a completed one before too many people had seen it, but it blew up beyond my wildest expectations.\n\nThanks to everyone who's shown so much support for \"Alphabet Lore\". I'm so proud to have finished this chapter, and I'm looking forward to showing you all what's next!
