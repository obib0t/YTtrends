{"description":"Richmond Till We Die. Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso\n\nIn this third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them as last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the ‚Äúwonder kid,‚Äù has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate‚Äôs contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.\n\nSong: ‚ÄúI Still Believe‚Äù by Frank Turner https://apple.co/IStillBelieve_FrankTurner \n\nAudio Description Version available: https://apple.co/TedLasso-\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Ted Lasso:\nhttps://twitter.com/TedLasso\n\nFollow AFC Richmond:\nhttps://twitter.com/AFCRichmond\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple TV+\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTVPlus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTVPlus\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

Volkanovski put forth a valiant effort and made the champion work for it in a decision that the Australian crowd wasn't too happy about.\n\nThe question of what Volkanovski would look like as a lightweight was answered pretty quickly. The featherweight champion showed his power in the opening minutes of the fight backing up Makhachev with heavy punches.\n\n#alexandervolkanovski #ufc284 #ufc #islammakhachev","title":"Alexander Volkanovski UFC 284 Tell All Interview and Talks Rematch with Islam Makhachev","duration":600,"channel_id":"UCsPqePbdUlmkyUYCaYg9qkw","author":"Alexander Volkanovski","date":"20230215","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91AcqzER4kw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/91AcqzER4kw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":383511}}

{"description":"On June 16, worlds collide. Watch the official trailer now for The Flash ‚Äì only in theaters. #TheFlashMovie \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù directed by Andy Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero‚Äôs first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in ‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian‚Ä¶ albeit not the one he‚Äôs looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry‚Äôs only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (‚ÄúBullet Train,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äù), Ron Livingston (‚ÄúLoudermilk,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù), Maribel Verd√∫ (‚ÄúElite,‚Äù ‚ÄúY tu mam√° tambi√©n‚Äù), Kiersey Clemons (‚ÄúZack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League,‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetheart‚Äù), Antje Traue (‚ÄúKing of Ravens,‚Äù ‚ÄúMan of Steel‚Äù) and Michael Keaton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù) and Michael Disco (‚ÄúRampage,‚Äù ‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (‚ÄúBirds of Prey,‚Äù ‚ÄúBumblebee‚Äù), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (‚ÄúDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming‚Äù) and Joby Harold (‚ÄúTransformers: Rise of the Beasts,‚Äù ‚ÄúArmy of the Dead‚Äù), based on characters from DC. The executive producers \nare Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Suicide Squad‚Äù), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (‚ÄúIT Chapter Two,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù), editors Jason Ballantine (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù) and Paul Machliss (‚ÄúThe Gentlemen,‚Äù ‚ÄúBaby Driver‚Äù), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (‚ÄúDoctor Strange,‚Äù ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äù); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch \n(‚ÄúThe Invisible Man,‚Äù the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films).\n\nWarner Bros.
