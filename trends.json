We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n#backpacking #travel #travelvlog #camping \n\n00:00 why we‚Äôre going to the woods\n00:30 this is not what you think it is\n02:53 how heavy our backpacks are\n04:05 first campsite\n05:40 we slept with MICE AND SPIDERS\n08:16 didn‚Äôt have to dig a hole to poop!\n09:52 why we love AG1\n11:07 what we‚Äôre eating for lunch everyday\n13:45 Nate‚Äôs life-altering decision :)\n14:58 extremely scary‚Ä¶\n16:35 setting up our tent for the first time!\n19:22 how we purify water\n20:20 climbing a sketchy tower for sunset\n22:27 day 3: early wake up call\n25:09 Nate did not drag me here\n29:37 PART 2 IS GOING TO BE WEIRD","title":"We Need a Break (going off the grid)","duration":1862,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20221008","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcAeXMhMW08","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/wcAeXMhMW08/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":614086}}

The benefit of using bricks to make a furnace is that it's quicker, easier, re-useable and portable relative to a furnace constructed in-situ from clay. This is because the old furnaces crack and need repairs where as the brick ones can be assembled and re-assembled with any broken bricks being swapped out as necessary. Also, the shape and height of the furnace is easily changed by adding/subtracting or re-arranging bricks.\n The first furnace used a square plan with the bricks laid on their sides with a inner cross section of 18 cm square. A 2.5 cm diameter tuyere was used and about 15 g of iron was made. The second furnace was the same but used a 5 cm diameter tuyere. It made about the same amount of iron. The 3rd furnace was a haexagonal plan furnace with a diameter of about 22 cm. The bricks were laid on their ends for this type. The smelt yielded the same as the square ones for the same input of ore, charcoal and effort.\nI'll probably stick to using the square design made from bricks in future. Things I may try later would be to increase the height of the furnace by adding more brick layers. I'd put in all the charcoal and ore for the smelt after preheating. Then I'd be able to operate the smelt without the interruption of needing to charge the furnace every 5 minutes with ore and charcoal.\nIn conclusion, bricks make a useful furnace in a shorter time and with less difficulty than in situ made furnaces, are re-useable and can be disassembled and rebuilt in various locations if needed while the bricks can be stored out of the way when not in use. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

{"description":"Today critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Rita Ora welcomes AD to London for a tour of her extraordinary Victorian-era home. Ora finished furnishing her new place with vintage finds from London‚Äôs famous Portobello Road Market - and most of the items she‚Äôd already owned and used in previous homes. Her sister and manager, Elena Ora, is responsible for arranging the furniture and interior designer Joanna Plant was brought in to add ‚Äúlittle bits and bobs‚Äù to tie everything together. As she works on her third album, Ora couldn‚Äôt be happier with the calm and grounding home base she‚Äôs created. ‚ÄúMy exterior self is super flamboyant, colorful, and I‚Äôm really proud of the decisions I make. Internally, my interior self is the opposite. I wanted my inner self reflected in my home.‚Äù\r\n\r\nRita Ora is an international critically acclaimed singer-songwriter with over 10 billion world-wide streams, four #1 UK singles, and holds the record for the most Top 10 singles for a British female artist in the UK in history with a total of 13. In addition to being one of most successful female artists in the UK, she also lends her voice to the series Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight on Netflix, and will star in the upcoming film Tin Soldier. As a multi-talented industry leader, Rita also launched the award-winning Pr√≥spero Tequila with Conecuh Brands and premier Master Distiller Stella Anguiano, where she serves as Chief Creative Partner.\r\n\r\nSee more of Rita's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/rita-ora-house-victorian-era-sanctuary-in-london\r\n\r\nShop Rita's home style!\r\n\r\n*Kitchen*\r\n(Similar) Set of Three Bread Boards: https://fave.co/3rtknsv\r\n(Similar) Ruffled Marble Bowl:¬†https://fave.co/3M8sOTu\r\nDelonghi Distinta Electric Kettle:¬†https://amzn.to/3EhmTK1\r\n\r\n*Bathroom*\r\nAesop Hand Soap:¬†https://fave.co/3SA4Bbt\r\nDiptyque Candle:¬†https://fave.co/3Cx8WX2\r\n(Similar) Hex Brushed Brass Towel Bar:¬†https://fave.co/3SROWV7\r\n(Similar) Huxton 2-Piece Iron Planter Set:¬†https://fave.co/3fwtGVQ\r\n\r\n*Bedroom*\r\n(Similar) Belle Nightstand: https://fave.co/3M5qr3Q\r\nCalypso Chandelier:¬†https://fave.co/3V0ItbA\r\n(Similar) Marilyn Monroe Vintage Print:¬†https://fave.co/3fJY8fd\r\n(Similar) Hand Tufted Tiger Face Rug:¬†https://fave.co/3CzOO6V\r\n(Similar) Feng Shui Red Resin Buddha Figurines:¬†https://amzn.to/3rrmHAt\r\n\r\n*Living Room*\r\n(Similar) Mid Century Modern Solid Teak and Brass Coffee Table: https://fave.co/3e0xJcU\r\nVersace Medusa Lumiere Ashtray:¬†https://fave.co/3UWXyLz\r\n(Similar) Margot 90\" Velvet Sofa:¬†https://fave.co/3RGuZ1L\r\n(Similar) Moritz Round Mirror, Brass 36\":¬†https://fave.co/3Ehkv6f\r\n(Similar) Still Carafe:¬†https://fave.co/3SCntGJ\r\nHermes Wool Cashmere Blanket:¬†https://fave.co/3RuY2Wc\r\n(Similar) 4 Piece Gold Fireplace Tool Set:¬†https://fave.co/3SDLVYi\r\n\r\n*Makeup Room*\r\nLego Brick Heads Spice Girls:¬†https://fave.co/3M5utcu\r\n\r\n*Dining Room*\r\nAnissa Kermiche Love Handles Light Gray Vase: https://fave.co/3EhbuK9\r\n(Similar) Recycled Glass Mason Jar Vase: https://fave.co/3Eh7nhq\r\n(Similar) Aurora Candlestick Holders:¬†https://fave.co/3fEVfwk\r\nDamien Hirst for Supreme Spots Skate Deck:¬†https://fave.co/3SU03fM\r\n(Similar) Ceramic Line Footed Planters White (set of 2):¬†https://fave.co/3e7laMQ\r\n(Similar) Aimee Dining Arm Chair:¬†https://fave.co/3Ei2Ew2\r\n\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

Her death was unexpected in that fans had no warning that she was ill, and she may not have been. We can‚Äôt help but zoom in on what would be her final message to fans, sent at 9AM on October 2nd. Take a look for yourself. Lynn‚Äôs last words were a Bible verse, John 3:20-21. ‚ÄúEveryone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.‚Äù If that hits, give a thumbs up. ‚ÄúEveryone who does evil hates the light ‚Ä¶ but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light.‚Äù \n\nIf you're new, Subscribe! ‚Üí http://bit.ly/subscribe-taste-of-country \r\n\r\nDownload the app ‚Üí http://tasteofcountry.com/app/ \r\nGo here ‚Üí http://tasteofcountry.com/\r\nLike us ‚Üí https://www.facebook.com/thetasteofcountry\r\nFollow us ‚Üí https://twitter.com/tasteofcountry\r\nGet our newsletter ‚Üí http://tasteofcountry.com/newsletter/\r\n\r\n#CountryMusic #Nashville","title":"Loretta Lynn‚Äôs Last Words Were the Stunning Truth","duration":176,"channel_id":"UCNl9LUgT_E1hxd4JMinnwkw","author":"Taste of Country","date":"20221004","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cp90cE97Fc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9cp90cE97Fc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":200831}}

{"description":"The 2023 Corvette C8 Z06 ($106,000 in the US, $128,000 starting in Canada) aspires to achieve a formidable goal: to slay supercar titans and crush its competition for a fraction of the cost. The mad scientists at Corvette say they designed it to have both the soul of a Ferrari 458 and the clinical speed of a Porsche GT2 RS. An extremely bold claim. \n\n670 horsepower. 8600 rpm redline. This is the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 in any production car ever. Will it be able to live up to its mighty expectations? Thomas and James aim to find out. We hope you enjoy the episode.
