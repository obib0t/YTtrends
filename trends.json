{"description":"In March 2022, Adam created a shiny solid sphere of aluminum using just a roll of standard foil wrap -- the so-called tin foil ball challenge (https://youtu.be/q_YZX1SgZ5Y).

In just one year since releasing his viral sensation ‚ÄúNever Comin‚Äô Home,‚Äù the first song he‚Äôd ever written or performed, the rising singer/songwriter has already earned more than 100 million global streams to date and charted his latest release, ‚ÄúFall In Love,‚Äù on the Billboard Hot 100. Born and raised in the small town of Louisville, IL, he grew up listening to hour after hour of country radio on long hauls across state lines with his father, who owned a trucking business. Back at home his mom instilled in him a life-long appreciation for the power chords and edgy vocals of 80‚Äôs hair rock. From long hours on the gas pipeline, to late nights of backbreaking roadwork, Zimmerman embodies the old school American values of hard work and dependability and applies the same steadfast mentality to his music. Through his plainspoken charm, contagious enthusiasm and genuine portrayal of life on the back roads, the up-and-comer has already attracted a loyal and passionate fan base. With more new music on the horizon, featuring the grit and gravel of his unmistakably Southern drawl, Zimmerman will continue to showcase the straightforward authenticity for which he is known and loved.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #FallInLove #RockAndAHardPlace","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Rock and A Hard Place (Official Music Video)","duration":227,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20220624","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyapQFCHUlg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyapQFCHUlg/hqdefault.jpg?v=62aa3836","content":{"View count":128592}}

He also asked if people were out looking for him.\n\nShe told him to wait for a call from his son, who was going to go out and find him, but Brown didn‚Äôt answer the phone after that, and nobody has been able to find him, even though hundreds of people out there helping with the search.\n\nBrown is 76 years old, about 5-foot-10, with white hair and blue eyes. He's also missing the tip of his index finger. \n\nHis car is a dark blue, 2014 Nissan Sentra with Oregon plates. \n\nThere had been a few sightings reported, but none were substantiated, said Daryle Brown, Ralph Brown‚Äôs son.\n\nDaryle said his parents were in their home on May 16 when Brown stood up and said he was going to his ‚Äúother house.‚Äù \n\nRalph has early-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs symptoms, which leads to confusion. He no longer has a driver‚Äôs license and has not driven a car in more than a year, Daryle said.\n\nHe drove away from the home in the 600 block of South 12th Avenue in Cornelius, Oregon. \n\nThere had been no location pings on his phone after 10:25pm that evening, and no communication from Brown in the time since he‚Äôs been missing. \n\nThis video/documentary shares with you the final search for Ralph and what it took to bring him home. \n\n‚ù§Ô∏è..

{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, ‚ÄúI am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth‚Äù\n‚Äî Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853‚Äì1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One¬Æ is the Presenting Sponsor of this year‚Äôs Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank‚Äôs three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center‚Äôs producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018. This year‚Äôs ceremony marks the 23rd year that the Kennedy Center‚Äôs marquee comedy award will be broadcast nationally.\n\nThe event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception in 1998.\n\n#TwainPrizePBS #JonStewart #DaveChappelle\n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Dave Chappelle on Jon Stewart | 2022 Mark Twain Prize","duration":514,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20220622","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmHX_gQuc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6pxmHX_gQuc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2011955}}

So in this video I built the Krusty Krab in real life and served Krabby Patties to random strangers that we could find on the street. This build turned out amazing and is definitely one of my favorite builds that we have ever done. This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way.

{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, ‚ÄúI am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth‚Äù\n‚Äî Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853‚Äì1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One¬Æ is the Presenting Sponsor of this year‚Äôs Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank‚Äôs three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center‚Äôs producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018. This year‚Äôs ceremony marks the 23rd year that the Kennedy Center‚Äôs marquee comedy award will be broadcast nationally.\n\nThe event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception in 1998.\n\n#TwainPrizePBS #JonStewart #SteveCarell\n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Steve Carell on Jon Stewart | 2022 Mark Twain Prize","duration":342,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20220622","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leN3PbNvi3c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/leN3PbNvi3c/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1108532}}

{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, ‚ÄúI am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth‚Äù\n‚Äî Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853‚Äì1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One¬Æ is the Presenting Sponsor of this year‚Äôs Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank‚Äôs three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center‚Äôs producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018.
