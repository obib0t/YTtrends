{"description":"Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n\n_________FAQs__________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone.

He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #3860 #HeatTucked #OfficialMusicVideo","title":"Quando Rondo - Heat Tucked [Official Music Video]","duration":167,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20230111","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab8g35-T81g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ab8g35-T81g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":465283}}

In this video we talk about Kang's connection to Shang-Chi, Ms. Marvel, and how this all feeds into Avengers: Secret Wars.\n\nThanks for supporting our channel!

I’ll explain why a little later, and also this trailer seems to confirm some theories weve had about how Kang connects to shang chi, the eternal, and ms marvel. It is all connected. So let's break this thing down.\n \n[trailer opening]. Right off the bat, this is a much darker trailer than what we’re used to seeing in ant man movies. We have the foreboding music, the shot at sunset, as if to say that the sun is setting on score’s time as ant man.  Reminds me a lot of the first trailer for Age of Ultron [clip]. \n\nThe shot is of San Francisco, of course where Ant Man 1 and 2 took place, but also the setting of Shang Chi's opening. That movie was directed by destin daniel cretton, who is now going to helm Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. This is a lot like the Russo brothers, who directed two Captain America films that shaped the final two Avengers films, INfinity war and Secret wars. So Ithink Cretton was chosen because Shang Chi did a lot of the groundwork to set up the Kang Dynasty. Maybe the people of Ta Lo are from alternate timelines, or the quantum realm.\n\nThen we have the mystery of the rings origin and the beacon they send out at the end of the movie, which this trailer gives us a major hint about.\n\nDoug: What is it?\n\nJust be patient, I’m getting there. So we see shots of Scott's life going well for him. In the last trailer we saw that he was given a plaque at the baskin robbins where he was fired [they always find out]. And they even retired his uniform, incorrect name tag and all. Ms marvel mentioned his successful podcast [clip]. And even wakanda forever had a bit on the news ticker about his best selling book, big me little me,\n\nSo Scott is very much taking advantage of his fame, but he still pines for his rosebud, the time he missed in the quantum realm. \n\nKang narrates [you’re an avenger]. And the D23 footage included a line that has not been in a  trailer, where Kang adds “have I killed you before?” which means that kang has killed many versions of the avengers across many realities.\n\nBut he likely has not encountered a scott lang before. And maybe this is why he realizes that Scott is the key to getting what he needs. And to emphasize this, the first shots of Scott as any man show him being really adept at using his powers–he breaks his fall by becoming a giant man. He’s the best he’s ever been at being a hero, and a far cry from this [anyone have any orange slices].\n\nThen we see that, despite his fame and success, Scott really just wants back the time with his daughter. The image of Cassie on his phone is still her as a little girl. And now,in the present day, she’s getting arrested. She has always taken after her dad. And since her dad was locked up in jail, it makes sense that she would follow suit. Except she was probably arrested at a protest of something, judging by her shirt which is anti-global warming.\n\nThe shot of Cassie in prison is intercut with Scott walking toward the camera with the pyms. Cleev framing, because cassie was all alone, while scott was off doing superhero stuff. And this ias kag narrates [but you’ve lost a lot of time]\n\nDoug: yeah what does kang mean by that, lost time?\n\nWell, first let me explain who Kang is in the comics, because that will help you to understand who he is in this movie.","title":"ANT-MAN: QUANTUMANIA Trailer BREAKDOWN: Every Easter Egg + Secret Wars EXPLAINED","duration":1524,"channel_id":"UCgMJGv4cQl8-q71AyFeFmtg","author":"ScreenCrush","date":"20230110","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKjXEzV10UY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKjXEzV10UY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":448792}}

{"description":"(AP) — The 6-year-old Virginia student who shot and wounded his teacher pulled the handgun from a backpack and shot her while she was teaching his first-grade class, a police chief said.\n\nNewport News Police Chief Steve Drew on Monday offered the first description of how the shooting happened. He had previously said that the shooting was not accidental and declined to elaborate.\n\nHe said the student pulled the gun out, pointed at the teacher and fired at her. He said there was no physical struggle over the gun preceding the gunshot. No students were injured.\n\nDrew said that the gun had been legally purchased by the child’s mother in York County. It was in the child’s residence, he put it in his back pack and brought it to school, the chief said.\n\nThe teacher who was wounded Friday in the shooting, Abby Zwerner, was in stable condition Monday at an area hospital. Describing her as a hero, Drew said he had spoken to her and one of her biggest concerns was for her students.\n\nDrew said after the shooting, the boy was physically restrained by a school employee and that he struck the employee. The boy was taken away in a police car.\n\nA candlelight vigil in honor of Zwerner was planned for Monday at 6:30 p.m.\n\nPrincipal Briana Foster Newton said in an update on the school’s website that the school will be closed for the week.\n\nPolice have declined to describe what led to the altercation or any other details about what happened in the classroom, citing the ongoing investigation. They have also declined to say how the boy got access to the gun or who owns the weapon.\n\nVirginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty. Authorities have not specified where the boy was being held.\n\nOn Monday morning, several parents, grandparents and community members gathered with a local pastor in an open patch of grass outside the school.\n\nAmong them was parent Eric Billet, who said each of his three children in the Newport News school system, two of whom go to Richneck, has reacted differently to the shooting.\n\nBillet’s son who is in middle school has raised concerns about school security, telling his dad that he felt safer at theme parks, which the boy argued had better security than his school.

{"description":"Episode 127 of Mike Finnegan's Garage is all about crossing another one off of my bucket list and don't worry, the Cadillac is not taking a back seat to this one. In fact, a week from now I should have the engine for the Caddy, which means more work, more progress, and more videos. In the meantime, I managed to drag this 1963 Chevrolet Split Window Corvette out of my neighbor's basement, where it's been sitting for years. \nAfter the Caddy is running, then it's full steam ahead on turning the Vette into a 6 second street car, using the 711ci Sonny Leonard Hemi as the powerplant.

{"description":"Lake Mead, which is located in Black Canyon approximately 30 miles east of Las Vegas U.S. is facing an unprecedented drought. As the drought rages on, the river and its reservoirs are facing a crisis. But, the water supply is drying up, which is having a profound effect on the region's economies.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing happening, as falling water levels reveal things previously hidden or lost, some with great implications for our well-being. What is happening to Lake Mead, and why is it drying up? And what sinister things and shocking discoveries lie beneath the water? Let's find out.\n\nLake Mead's profile and history.\nOn the Colorado river in the South-West of the U.S. lies the sprawling Lake Mead which straddles the states of Arizona and Nevada and is 24 miles east of Sin City, Las Vegas. An artificial reservoir formed by the iconic Hoover Dam, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States by volume when at its total capacity of 1.1 trillion cubic feet of water and is the second largest by surface area in the U.S. at 247 square miles, eclipsed only by Lake Powell, another reservoir upstream of Lake Mead on the Colorado river with a surface area of 254 square miles. \n\nWith such a large capacity, the Lake can hold the total annual flow of the Colorado river for two years. Lake Mead stretches 65 miles at full pool from the Hoover dam to Pearce Ferry; however, the Lake is relatively thin, with a maximum width of 9.3 miles. At full pool, Lake Mead has an elevation of about 1229 feet above sea level and a maximum depth of 532 ft. While not a particularly wide lake, it boasts a shoreline of 759 miles.\n\nterrifying discovery, nature discoveries, euphrates river, new discoveries 2022, euphrates river drying up, euphrates river drying up 2022, end of times, mississippi river drying up 2022, biblical, rapture, rapture dreams, rapture 2022, eden garden, garden of eden, mississippi river, biblical archaeology, revelations, end of times, the prophecy, bible prophecy, lake mead, lake mead water level 2022, lake mead update, drying up, drought, climate change, supply chain, hoover dam, lake powell,","title":"What JUST HAPPENED With Lake Mead SHOCKED Scientists!","duration":777,"channel_id":"UCpIhGdHkOJ2sHkqM3YNIKsA","author":"Nature Discoveries","date":"20230108","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl97t2PcC8w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cl97t2PcC8w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":619340}}

{"description":"What is up, I'm Chad Wild Clay. My dream is to go from Minecraft NOOB to PRO after 100 days in Minecraft. I'm stuck in my house recovering from spine surgery and I've missed hanging out with you Spy Ninjas so I figured a Minecraft challenge is the best way to have fun with you all. \n\nToday is my first day of learning how to play Minecraft and the goal is survival of my first night. I need to learn how to build a Minecraft house. Maybe I need to watch a YouTube minecraft house tutorial. Then I'll need to figure out how to put a bed in the house and sleep my first night. Hopefully, I can survive without running into any creepers, hackers, or zombies. \n\nIf I become a true Minecraft Pro, maybe I can play with one of my favorite Minecraft YouTubers. Here are some of fun Minecraft gameplay:\n\nPrestonPlayz - Minecraft Myths You Shouldn't Watch at Night...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2KhmZ3A0Ho\n\nCash - Cash Has A GOLD TOUCH In Minecraft!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL9nTBnZ3Ho\n\nAphmau - Playing Minecraft as an UNHELPFUL Hamster!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL-QzqGmIVE\n\nNico - Nico vs Cash MILLIONAIRE House Battle in Minecraft!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i99NV1sVzIY\n\nGEVidsTV - NOOB vs HACKER: I Cheated In a BOXY BOO Build Challenge!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP7-4gh_cWo\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.
