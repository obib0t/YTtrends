{"description":"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nNikki Birch | June 9, 2023\nI was working late when Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds first arrived at the office to rehearse for his Tiny Desk concert. Within moments, it was clear it would be an exceptional performance. The next day, my colleagues waited patiently to see the legendary singer, songwriter and producer. Because when it comes to matters of the heart, Babyface has turned our angst, our triumphs, our devastation, into timeless love songs that have scored the romances of more than one generation.\n\nJoined by top-tier talent ‚Äî Tank, Chant√© Moore and Avery Wilson ‚Äî Babyface came out swinging. From the songs that put him on the map, to those he wrote or produced for other icons, around the room hit after hit was met with swoons, sighs and not a few tears. (Ok, maybe that was just me.)\n\nBabyface is a titan of the music industry: with numerous top 10 hits, 12 Grammys (50 nominations) and a jaw-dropping roster of collaborations. In 2022, he assembled a stellar ensemble of women for one of my favorite albums of the year, Girls Night Out. To watch this master of pen and sound behind the Tiny Desk was truly epic and nothing short of a dream come true.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Two Occasions\"\n\"Whip Appeal\"\n\"Superwoman\"\n\"Take A Bow\"\n\"Not Gon' Cry\"\n\"Can We Talk\"\n\"Change the World\"\n\"Thnks fr th Mmrs\"\n\"I'll Make Love To You\"\n\"End Of The Road\"\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds: vocals, keys, guitar \nErskine Hawkins III: keys, music director\nAntoine Porter: guitar \nWalt Barnes Jr.: bass\nReggie Regg: drums \nTank: vocals \nChant√© Moore: vocals \nAvery Wilson: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter \nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna \nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #babyface","title":"Babyface: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1782,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230609","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eHc0Xz_Hio","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3eHc0Xz_Hio/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":469324}}

{"description":"Disney World really is a kingdom.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nHave you ever wondered why Disney World is located where it is? Or how it came to be such a massive, self-contained universe? It‚Äôs a story that involves secret land deals, special districts, and, now, a corporation and a government locked in a feud.\n\nThe story of why Disney World is in Florida marries business and governmental concerns about the creation of the massive property. The engineering ranges from unique physical construction (like the creation of a lake) to unique legal construction (like the creation of a self-running government that could even build its own sewer system).\n\nFurther Reading:\nBuying Disney‚Äôs World (https://www.amazon.com/Buying-Disneys-World-Florida-Swampland/dp/1733642056) by Aaron H. Goldberg is an authoritative work about the purchase of Disney. Drawing from corporate records, internal histories, and more, it‚Äôs a comprehensive narrative about Disney World‚Äôs creation and early years.\n\nThere are a lot of great Disney fan websites out there that are obsessive in their Disney coverage. I found Jim Hill‚Äôs history of Reedy Creek to be a good intro to the topic. (https://jimhillmedia.com/history-reedy-creek-improvement-district-part-1/)\n\nDisney news is also vibrant on YouTube. Mickey Views provides good perspective on the current battles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MickeyViews/videos\n\nFor the latest news and updates about the DeSantis-Disney conflict: bit.ly/3oOHz75\n\nVox is an explanatory newsroom on a mission to help everyone understand our weird, wonderful, complicated world, so that we can all help shape it.

It has a bit more ‚Äòsparkle‚Äô and refinement, but this will ONLY be appreciated if the final speakers are given a signal from a high-quality output source like a dedicated DAC.\n\nIf you want to print the baffles, the recommended magnet size is 10mm diameter round neodymium magnets, with 5mm depth maximum.\n\n\nFixtures and fittings:\n\n\n40pcs M3 threaded inserts (for the speaker drivers)\n40pcs 3mm x 8mm countersunk m3 black screws (for the speaker drivers)\n200pcs Self-tapping 2mm diameter screws, 10mm length max (build platform screws)\n24pcs 3mm diameter self-tapping screws (amplifier screws, DSP chamber, midtone chamber base)\n2x step-down voltage regulators, 5v output (for powering the DSP and fan)\n2x 1000uf capacitor (add across the output of the regulator to reduce interference)\n2x Power Adapters (100w ideally, each. A low cost option is old laptop power adapters)\n1x roll of 16awg wire\n\nRecommended glue is CT1 - it sticks to PLA well enough and doesn't set too quickly allowing the whole speaker to be screwed together before it begins to dry. This allows any spill over to be wiped away (use an old brush to get inside the air guide etc). Sets with some amout of flexibility. Readily availabe in the UK but not sure about equivalents for other territories. Visit the Forum or Discord server to see what the community recommends for each region.\n\nSAFETY NOTES ON PLASTER OF PARIS: If you're stupid with it, it can be dangerous. NEVER put your hands/feet/whatever into plaster of paris EVER. It can suddenly set without warning, creating a lot of heat in the center, so you'll get burned or worse. Because of this never leave a batch of wet plaster of paris in reach of children or pets. Wearing a mask is recommended to not breathe in any dust, and goggles to stop it splashing into your eyes.
