{"description":"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts ‚Äî both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nBobby Carter | June 30, 2022\n\"We celebrate Black Music Month. This has been Black magic.\" Truer words may have never been spoken behind the Tiny Desk as R&B goliath Usher caps off our month-long celebration of Black music, highlighting a catalog chock-full of hits spanning 25 years. It's been over two years since NPR headquarters was abuzz with chatter of a legend in the building. After an early morning rehearsal for his set at the Something in the Water Festival in Washington, D.C., he made his way over to deliver an unforgettable performance.\n\nUsher and his band, all dipped in black, set it off with an introduction over a funky horn-laced instrumental reminiscent of a Blaxploitation flick. They keep that groove going right into a reworked version of his 1997 breakout single, \"You Make Me Wanna...\" Twenty-five years later, Usher sits arguably as the king of R&B. Between 2000 and 2010, there was no debate whatsoever, with his string of records that included the biggest R&B album of the 21st century, Confessions.\n\nWhat he's done in the vocal booth is only half of his claim to fame. The stage is where he's continued to shine as he prepares for the second leg of his Las Vegas residency. This loose and playful set touches on his many career phases; the crooning, the deeply personal, the club bangers and even the Tik Tok challenges indicate that he could just be reaching his prime. Recently, we've heard plenty of hot takes, wild battles and social media fodder about who sits at the mountaintop in the world of R&B. Usher Raymond has entered the chat.\n\nSET LIST\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\"\n\"Superstar\"\n\"U Don't Have to Call\"\n\"Nice & Slow\"\n\"Confessions Part II\"\n\"My Way\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nUsher: vocals\nEric Bellinger: vocals\nVedo: vocals\nDmitry Gorodetsky: bass\nLemar Guillary: trombone\nBrandyn Phillips: trumpet\nJay Flat: saxophone\nDarek Cobbs: keys\nErick Walls: guitar\nRyan Carr: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Kara Frame\nEditor: Michael Zamora\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, Alant√© Serene\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #usher #BMM","title":"Usher: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1487,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220630","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8ODGFWgFg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/up8ODGFWgFg/hqdefault.jpg?v=62bcc32c","content":{"View count":2556712}}

The focus is on freedom, driving, exploration and immersion. It has minimal car maintenance and survival elements.\n\nInfinite Desert, Freedom and Driving:\nThere are no invisible walls or unable to jump over small fences, or blinking red \"wrong direction\" signs on the hud. The car won't need 10-20 liter fuel over just only a few hundred meters, with a full tank, you could go approximately 500 kilometers. If you see a distant big mountain, you can go there and if you are capable, you can climb it. If you don't like where the mirrors are facing you can adjust them however you want or throw them away while driving at full speed. If you want to lean out of the car, or closer to the radio or near anything, you can.","title":"I Turned a Fun Road Trip Into a Nightmare Voyage - The Long Drive","duration":1129,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220701","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88RAHxrQ33M","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/88RAHxrQ33M/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1351317}}

It‚Äôs common for YouTubers to have a bike sponsor now. Many creators are only able to go full time with the help of one or more sponsors, as was my case back in 2017. At that time, my arrangement with Diamondback wasn‚Äôt so common in the YouTube world, as I wasn‚Äôt a professional or competing in any capacity. This seemed pretty unthinkable at the time, but it turned out to be not so crazy. \n\nWe had some great years, Diamondback! Thanks for all your support, and your dedication to the mountain biking community. \n\nBerm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts\nhttps://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nCheck out our second channel for \"express\" videos https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpP5PqrzODWpFU961acUbg\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nMusic in this video is from \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg\nand https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20\n\nSupport Berm Park!

The ore was a species of bacteria that lives by oxidizing iron dissolved in ground water. It appears as an orange/yellow cloudy precipitate in creeks and ponds. It's a very common natural occurrence and can be found on all continents. I collected the diluted ore and poured it into a large, porous ceramic pot I made. The water leaked out, leaving behind the concentrated iron bacteria \"mud\" like substance. I dried it out until it resembled rusty earth. It took a month to collect the ore for one 2 hour smelt, from a stretch of creek about 20 meters long. \n\nCharcoal was then made simply by burning a pile of wood in a small pit and then extinguishing it with just enough water once it had visibly carbonized. It was quicker to make than the charcoal I normally make in a mound (1hr vs 2.5hrs) and took less preparation time making than the mound from mud. A small furnace was made and the multiblade blower (made in the last episode) was attached to it for air supply. \n\nThe furnace was preheated for an hour with wood and filled with charcoal at the end, using the blower periodically but not full blast. Then over the next hour, 3 double handfuls of charcoal (about 500g) and 2 single handfuls or ore (about 200g) were added every 5 minutes while blowing air into the furnace to burn it at this rate. Then there was a 30 min burn down still using the blower till the charcoal reached the level of the air entry. The total operation took 2 hrs. A lump of slag was taken from the furnace and broken up. Iron prills up to about 1 cm in diameter were retrieved. For the sake of experiment I weighed the iron produced on modern scales= 40g iron from an estimated 1.2 kg of ore. Even though this is a low yield by modern standards it is a marked improvement over my previous smelts that produced much smaller and fewer prills over all. I did another smelt that almost exactly reproduced this result (80g of iron stored). The increase in efficiency is due to the much better blower design (8 blades vs the original 4). \n\nNext I cast the iron in a mold. The melting point of pure metalic iron is 1538 C. However, the iron prills I produced are cast iron, an alloy of iron and carbon where carbon is about 2-4% by weight. Cast iron has a relatively tepid melting point of 1150 C. Such a temperature is easily attainable in an open hearth with charcoal and a forced air supply. So, I put the prills into a triangular clay mold and put it into a simple pit forge that took very little time to make. Importantly, I made a special flat air pipe that spread the incoming air into a sheet that blew over the width of the mold to heat all of it evenly, a round one would only heat the middle of the mold and not melt it completely. Charcoal was then put on top of the mold about 12.5 cm deep and the air blast started. The fire became white hot, exceeding the 1150 C needed to melt the iron. The iron melted filling the mold and the iron triangle was taken from it. \n\nInitially, I was going to make it into an axe head, but decided it was too brittle (cast iron is actually harder than pure iron but brittle) so I sharpened it into a knife. It took many hours of sharpening to bring the end to a point. It's not a sharp blade it works well for drilling holes in timber (like for making fire drill sockets). This represents the first iron tool I've made completely from scratch in the wild. Future experiments will focus on obtaining greater yields of iron, exploiting richer sources of ore and ultimately making better iron tools.","title":"Primitive Technology: Iron knife made from bacteria","duration":695,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20220630","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhW4XFGQB4o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dhW4XFGQB4o/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1460284}}

{"description":"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts ‚Äî both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nAshley Pointer | June 29, 2022\nAfter taking a sip of his tea towards the end of his six-song set, Denzel Curry turns to his band and exclaims: ‚ÄúWe lowkey breezed through this b****! That‚Äôs great for two rehearsals!‚Äù \n\nFrom the moment Curry and his people stepped foot into NPR headquarters to record their Tiny Desk concert, the vibes were right. With a 10-piece configuration ‚Äî consisting of drums, bass, keys, guitar, horns and percussion ‚Äî the rapper put on a flawless and inspired live performance of songs off his latest LP as well as some of his biggest hits, all freshly arranged for the Tiny Desk.  \n\nOver the course of a decade, Curry has released a number of albums and EPs, becoming one of the most versatile emcees in hip-hop today. His sixth studio album, Melt My Eyez See Your Future, marked a new artistic beginning for him: infusing neo-soul, jazz and traditional hip-hop influences into the album, with less ‚Äúrah‚Äù and more mature introspection. Throughout this concert, you get a little bit of both. \n\nCurry and the Cold-Blooded Soul Band open their set with ‚ÄúMelt Session #1,‚Äù a feel-good neo-soul groove where Curry‚Äôs introspective lyrics flow beautifully, taking center stage. Then kicking it up a notch, Curry performs ‚ÄúWalkin‚Äù and ‚ÄúTroubles‚Äù with an assist from DJ POSHtronaut, employing some serious bounce complimented by catchy horn lines. In the second half of his set, Curry takes us back with ‚ÄúDIET_.‚Äù Evoking instant head-bops as bass and drums smoothly lock in, Curry charms our audience with his improvised rhymes and exuberant personality.  \n\nAs Curry and the band closed out the concert going absolutely bonkers with ‚ÄúRICKY,‚Äù  I could feel how light the room had gotten as everyone in the audience fed off Curry‚Äôs infectious energy fueled by distorted guitar and bass and punchy horns. ‚ÄúYou know I killed that s***. You know I murked that s***!‚Äù Yes, Denzel Curry. Yes you did. \n\nSET LIST\n‚ÄúMelt Session #1‚Äù\n‚ÄúWalkin‚Äù\n‚ÄúTroubles‚Äù\n‚ÄúDIET_‚Äù\n‚ÄúCLOUT COBAIN | CLOUT CO13A1N‚Äù\n‚ÄúRICKY‚Äù\n\nMUSICIANS\nDenzel Curry: vocals\nDJ POSHtronaut: vocals\nMarcus Paul: trumpet \nBrandyn Phillips: trumpet\nTim McKay: saxophone/flute\nAlex Csillag: trombone\nBrian Gazo: percussion\nBrian Patterson: drums\nJay Winfield: keys\nJack Siegel: guitar\nDavid McKinzie: bass\n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nEditor: Kara Frame\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, Alant√© Serene\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #BMM #denzelcurry","title":"Denzel Curry: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1184,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220629","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glHqWvkpRqo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/glHqWvkpRqo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":537418}}

{"description":"Because of the potential size of the future, the most important thing about our actions today might be their impact on future generations. This simple-sounding idea has some surprising moral implications: https://80000hours.org/kurzgesagt-last-human\n\nSources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sources-last-human/\n\nThis video was created in partnership with the Open Philanthropy Project\n\nKurzgesagt in 8 languages: https://linktr.ee/kgs_international\n\nThe future of humanity seems insecure. Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism and so many people think our end is in sight. But humans always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they‚Äôre important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on. \nThis is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants. What makes this worse is that we actually may live at an extremely critical moment in human history.

Umpire Angel Hernandez is probably the most infamous at the moment, but do you know Pat Hoberg? John Libka? Alan Porter? They're gonna be umpiring the strike zone for a lot longer than Angel Hernandez, Laz Diaz, or CB Bucknor.\n\nIn this episode of Baseball Bits, a Foolish Baseball production, there will be plenty of time to look at some MLB worst calls and MLB best calls, especially with regards to the MLB strike zone. But we'll also dig deeper on the subject of Robo-umps, the Automated Ball Strike System that may soon replace human strike zone callers. \n\nUmpScoreCards is a fairly new, public-facing way to grade umpires, and we'll be leaning on their work heavily to find the truth. Does MLB have an umpire problem? Kyle Schwarber seems to think so. But maybe it's the K-Zone that has us fooled. \n_______________________________________\nUmpScoreCards: https://www.umpscorecards.com/\nUmpScores: https://www.umpscores.com/\nHardball Times on QuesTec: https://tht.fangraphs.com/tht-live/does_questec_affect_the_strike_zone/\nBarry Bonds on QuestTec: https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-06-11-0306120051-story.html\n\nSoundtrack from Maxo: \nhttps://soundcloud.com/maxoelectronic\nhttps://maxoisnuts.bandcamp.com/","title":"What Bad Umpiring Looks Like | Baseball Bits","duration":1035,"channel_id":"UCbW12JIVAdi5NugdakbU33A","author":"Foolish Baseball","date":"20220627","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nX_ZphDNQM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_nX_ZphDNQM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":422621}}

{"description":"Hello friends & welcome to another video!! This week, I traveled to a Lost Luggage store with HopeScope to buy and try some lost luggage items...\n\nOver the past few years, we have tried a number of interesting ~secondhand purchasing experiences~, like buying an abandoned storage unit, buying a box of Amazon customer returns, and visiting an Amazon returns store - and something that I have been very interested in trying for quite a while now, is buying lost airline luggage. Because apparently if you lose a piece of luggage while traveling, and never come back for it, the airline will eventually sell it. And if you're in the US, chances are that they will sell it to the Unclaimed Baggage store in Scottsboro, AL - who sorts through and resells the items from that lost luggage. So we flew down there with our friend HopeScope to check out the store and buy a lost luggage haul of our own: a head-to-toe outfit each!! What did you guys think of our lost looks? Would you shop at this store?\n\nPS - Unclaimed Baggage does sell some of their inventory online here!\nhttps://www.unclaimedbaggage.com/\n\nCheck out HopeScope's channel & video here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAM2fyCjEdROyELretVTiiw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5aHcu19wio\n\nCheck out Unclaimed Baggage here! \nhttps://www.instagram.com/unclaimedbag/\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/‚Äã\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nLona Smith\nBryce Jennings\nDave Szamet\nNez Covington\nJarvis Rooker\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza","title":"I Went To A Lost Luggage Store","duration":1677,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20220626","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h31p4OLbqSc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/h31p4OLbqSc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3135250}}

Romain Dumas' time of 39.9 seconds was smashed earlier in the day in practice, and a further 0.1 seconds in the Timed Shootout.\n\nIs this the best Goodwood run you've ever seen?\n\nThe Future of Motorsport Power presented by DHL\n\n#FOS #Goodwoodrecord #McMurtry\n\n#gw_dhl\n\nOfficial Website üëâ http://www.goodwood.com/grr/\nFacebook üëâ http://www.facebook.com/goodwoodrrc\nInstagram üëâ http://www.instagram.com/goodwoodrrc/ \nTwitter üëâ http://www.twitter.com/goodwoodrrc\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more racing cars, supercars, new car reviews, historic motorsport and Goodwood event coverage  üëâ http://bit.ly/GoodwoodTV\n\nBuy your Goodwood Event tickets üëâ http://bit.ly/GWBuyTickets","title":"39.08!
