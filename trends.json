{"description":"The drama surrounding the Boston Celtics and especially their head coach Ime Udoka has been the main topic these past few days. And it culminated with the team suspending Udoka for a full season. This came as a shock to some, and it sure looks like a very steep penalty. \nSo let me explain what‚Äôs the real reason behind the suspension. What up everybody, my name is Stefan and this is Heat Check. Let‚Äôs get into it.\nShams Charania has new info on this topic that gives us a different perspective of the whole story.\nIn his latest article on the Athletic, Charania writes that Some members of the Celtics organization first became aware of the relationship in July. At that time, team leadership was led to believe by both parties that the relationship was consensual. But the woman recently accused Udoka of making unwanted comments toward her ‚Äî leading the team to launch a set of internal interviews. After which, the final decision was made.\nNow this is a new moment in this whole situation and a big one at that. This is the exact reason for why the code of conduct even exists.\nRemember the Dallas Mavericks debacle? There was a huge investigation done on Mavs office members that revealed sexual harassments, domestic violence, and all kinds of other detrimental behaviour. It ended ugly, and it even involved the owner Marc Cuban as a person who knew some of these issues but tried to come to settlements and confidentiality agreements.\nWell this is the exact scenario that the Celtics want to avoid. A case by case falloff and corrosion of the team‚Äôs culture.\nEven with having this code of conduct and these workplace guidelines, you see with this new info that they were still hesitant to implement when they found out about the affair.\nBut once there was even the slightest change of tone by the woman, accusing Udoka of making certain comments, the team saw how this could be a slippery slope and how the issue might snowball into a much bigger thing.\nThe woman could decide to sue, or go public with accusations, and her side of the story, all kinds of scenarios might develop from this. And you can see how it can become very ugly very soon. \nWith this suspension however, I feel like Boston set the bar high. The standards to which the team members will be held, and the expectations for how they should conduct themselves are nothing short of professional.\nThis is not some end of the bench guy, or an unknown team member, but rather the head coach we‚Äôre talking about. Possibly the greatest piece for their incredible turnaround and the road to the finals last year.\nIt would be very tempting for a team to forgive and forget when it comes to a prominent piece of their success. But with this move, their action is loud and clear. The franchise, and the organization comes before any single member of it.\nIt‚Äôs just unfortunate that it might be a step backwards for this team when it comes to actual basketball. This sudden coaching change for this season, along with the latest news that Robert Williams will have surgery and miss 4-6 weeks, it‚Äôs a huge blow. And suddenly the odds of them reaching the finals again have just plummeted.\nLet me know in the comments if you think that the Celtics can survive all of this. That‚Äôs it for now, subscribe and talk to you in the next one. Peace out.","title":"EXPOSED: The Real Reason For The Ime Udoka Suspension","duration":211,"channel_id":"UCmwxBk7Af9OnnloGZzp6JnQ","author":"Heat Check","date":"20220923","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgrRmuKMi30","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrRmuKMi30/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":121050}}

With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nDonut County description (from Steam):\n\nDonut County is a story-based physics puzzle game where you play as an ever-growing hole in the ground. Meet cute characters, steal their trash, and throw them in a hole.\n\nWhere Trash is Treasure\nRaccoons have taken over Donut County with remote-controlled trash-stealing holes. You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes.\n\nWhen BK falls into one of his own holes, he‚Äôs confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground‚Ä¶ and they demand answers!\n\nThe Hole Keeps Growing\n‚Ä¢ EXPLORE every character‚Äôs home, each with their own unique environment.\n‚Ä¢ MOVE the hole to swallow up their stuff, growing bigger each time.\n‚Ä¢ COMBINE objects inside for crazy effects: cook soup, breed bunnies, launch fireworks, and more.\n‚Ä¢ CATAPULT things back out of the hole. You can use it to solve puzzles...or just destroy stuff.\n‚Ä¢ DEVOUR everything. The hole won‚Äôt stop until the whole county is all gone.\n\n#EazySpeezy #DonutCounty #Speedrun","title":"Donut County speedruns are incredibly satisfying","duration":1779,"channel_id":"UCQSEAbOs6vsJfy7WN7iYaGQ","author":"EazySpeezy","date":"20220922","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63L0yiN3Ix0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/63L0yiN3Ix0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":537203}}

I was soooo pumped to have great friends and twin who decided to throw me the best bachelorette weekend ever! \n\nIf you see Bailey doing most of the vlogging, it is because I just wanted to enjoy the weekend and still vlog for y‚Äôall!\n\nWe booked a cool cabin airbnb in Texas on a lake, and had the best time. I invited a handful of friends, old college roommates, sister-in-laws, and siblings! We had everything from matching pjs, to cute sweatshirts, to gift baskets I made for everyone. Of course we had classic bachelorette activities, starting with a girl‚Äôs night out! We also played games, swam, and hung out until early in the morning catching up with each other (though losing a lot of sleep haha!).

{"description":"-An overview of the drama unfolding over the ship channel in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n-Preorder my new book before the holiday rush: https://practical.engineering/book\n\nErrata:\nAt 3:08, the old Harbor Bridge actually does have narrow pedestrian walkways, but they lack connectivity with pedestrian infrastructure on either side of the bridge.\nAt 3:21, a clarification: The ships can't enter the port empty (because they would have too much air draft). That means they can't be fully loaded in the inner harbor because they are already carrying some weight when they enter.\nAt 12:40, I meant to say \"20% above their capacity\"\n\nIn July of 2022, the Texas Department of Transportation issued an emergency suspension of work on the half-finished Harbor Bridge project in Corpus Christi, citing serious design flaws that could cause the main span to collapse if construction continues. Since then, they have continued a very public feud with the contractor that is far from resolved. This video explores some of the alleged design flaws and discusses potential next steps on the bridge project.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Nope, the spelling isn‚Äôt wrong, Ariel is merely using the word differently, a contraction of ‚ÄòHigh Performance Carbon Reduction‚Äô. So 'Hipercar'. Carbon emissions rather than carbon fibre. There‚Äôs a lot of the latter about, although underneath the chassis is aluminium and most of the body sections are weighty 3D-printed test panels. It‚Äôs 1,759kg as it sits here, but Ariel is confident of dropping that below 1,500kg with full carbon panels and carbon wheels. The jet turbine is a range extender ‚Äì it exists to charge the 56kWh battery, not drive the wheels. Available as either 2WD or 4WD, with or without the jet turbine, full house versions are likely to be knocking on the door of seven figures. That‚Äôs a complete sea change for Ariel, for a car without classic hypercar elegance. But this is new tech, new age, new customer base. It‚Äôs something totally different, something wild and outrageous, the essence of Ariel in electric form.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n0:35 Ariel HQ\n1:04 The Hipercar\n2:15 Q+A with Simon Saunders\n12:39 Drive\n14:20 Launch\n15:11 Outro\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nMORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:\nWant to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?

{"description":"Sponsor: Fractal Pop Air RGB Case on Amazon https://geni.us/TMxbP\nNVIDIA just announced the new GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080 16GB, and RTX 4080 12GB. The new cards use the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture and are priced at $900 for the 4080 12GB, $1200 for the RTX 4080 16GB, and $1600 for the RTX 4090 24GB cards. In this video, we also talk about the specs -- like CUDA core count, RT (ray tracing) performance expectations, power utilization and consumption targets, and memory bandwidth. NVIDIA additionally announced DLSS 3, which is a major step revision over DLSS 2 and could have wider-reaching implications outside of just the GPU space (and could impact CPU bottlenecked scenarios as well). We also briefly talk about some of the architectural changes, but we‚Äôll leave most of those until after NVIDIA‚Äôs architectural briefing with the press.\n\nGrab the BRAND NEW GN ‚ÄòAmp‚Äô Medium Modmat on the store and support our independent reviews, testing, and journalism: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/medium-modmat-v2\n\nEVGA DROPPED NVIDIA.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.
