We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•","title":"33 Hours in the World's Best First Class","duration":1536,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20230121","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6hpzfYV2fU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6hpzfYV2fU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":674626}}

{"description":"It's not you ‚Äî the dialogue in TV and movies has gotten harder to hear.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nHave you ever been watching a show or movie, and then a character delivers a line so unintelligible you have to scramble to find the remote and rewind? For me, this moment came during the climax of the Pete Davidson film ‚ÄúThe King of Staten Island,‚Äù where his most important line was impossible to understand. \n\nI had to rewind three times ‚Äî and eventually put subtitles on ‚Äî to finally pick up what he was saying.\n\nThis experience isn‚Äôt unique ‚Äî gather enough people together and you can generally separate them into two categories: People who use subtitles, and people who don‚Äôt. And according to a not-so-scientific YouTube poll we ran on our Community tab, the latter category is an endangered species ‚Äî 57% of you said you always use subtitles, while just 12% of you said you generally don‚Äôt.\n \nBut why do so many of us feel that we need subtitles to understand the dialogue in the things we watch?\n\nThe answer to that question is complex ‚Äì and we get straight to the bottom of it in this explainer, with the help of dialogue editor Austin Olivia Kendrick.\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Use my code PAOLO15 at https://partner.bokksu.com/paolo15  to get $15 off your first Bokksu Japanese snack box!\n\nThis is a Japan behind the counter food tour of a local Japanese bento shop. For more than 40 years, Bento Kawano has been making delicious Japanese handmade bento lunches at the affordable price of 600yen. At this value and quality it‚Äôs no surprise everyday that the customer lunch lines wrap around the entire block.  One important things about this Japanese bento shop is that they must be extra careful about food safety.  Since Bentos are designed to be able to sit on the shelf for several hours without refrigeration, the food must always be fully cooked. Run by Japanese food craftsman, Inoue san, he changes the menu everyday so his customers have something to look forward to.  He particularly enjoys analyzing the performance of his previous bentos and creating new ones to see how popular it will be, but ultimately he says that whatever bento he serves, he creates each one as if he‚Äôll be sharing it with his loved ones. Interestingly, this Tokyo bento shop runs 4 rice cookers simultaneously throughout the entire day to keep up with the demand using a special hitomebore rice from Miyagi prefecture known for its exquisite taste especially when its cooled down.  Even the rice at the shop was specifically selected by Inoue san.  I hope you enjoy this Tokyo Hidden gem bento shop.   \n\nBento Kawano\n- https://goo.gl/maps/LUWZtAGDey1msVFw6\n- https://www.genkigohan.com/\n\nWatch more Japan Behind the Counter videos here\n- https://tokyozebra.com/btc\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n___ Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ___\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?

This statement was inspired by the observation that so many aspects of the physical world seem to be describable and predictable by mathematical equations to incredible precision especially as quantum phenomena. But quantum phenomena have no subjective qualities and have questionable physicality. They seem to be completely describable by only numbers, and their behavior precisely defined by equations.

With no exploits and plenty of luck, this is one strategy you don't want to miss out on!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage.

{"description":"Nicholaus Joseph Williams, better known by his stage name Trinidad James is a Trinidadian-American rapper. In 2012, he signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. The label dropped him in 2014 when he failed to release an album, although he continues to release music as an independent artist and is signed to Artist Publishing Group for songwriting.  \n\nIn this interview Marco starts off by asking who does Trinidad want to be? The interview starts very awkwardly as Trinidad has a bear mask on. Trinidad challenges Marco and says Marco brought him on the show to exploit him. The tables are turned as Trinidad seems to be trolling Marco and has him on his toes. Marco asks Trinidad to remove his mask and Trinidad asks Marco to tie his tie and in exchange Trinidad takes the tie and puts it on. Trinidad takes off his mask to reveal his face with one eyed made up. Marco gets into the interview asking why Trinidad hasn‚Äôt made any new music. Trinidad reveals that he wanted to know what the business of entertainment was about. Trinidad talks about his relationships with record labels. Trinidad goes deeper into relationships. Trinidad then goes into his various products and the meaning behind them. Trinidad asks Marco what he thinks about him. Trinidad and Marco go back and forth about the word ugly. The conversation speeds up and the two go back and forth. Marco‚Äôs phone goes off and Marco blames it on Matt the Producer. Matt the Producer enters and Trinidad and Matt get into a discussion that gets a little tense. Trinidad and Marco continue the interview. Marco asks Trinidad about his hair. Matt the Producer tells Trinidad to get out of Marco‚Äôs creative space. A lady enters from the backstage and Trinidad yells at the lady and Marco invites her on stage. She awkwardly exits and Marco attempts to end the interview as Marco exits while talking to Matt the Producer and the mics are hot. Trinidad throws his chair and goes under the ladder and Matt the Producer holds exception.\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n \nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @mattablespromotions\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @Breakbeatmedia @FunnyMarco\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube page, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Trinidad James Talks Kanye, TIG, Def Jam, Painted Nails, Stage Fight","duration":1454,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20230118","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNfPcgFtVc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NRNfPcgFtVc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":647324}}

To further bolster growth the government borrowed huge amounts of money at high interest rates.

Deploy your Falcon Scout and control where it flies, ping or place markers, and caw to create a radius in which all opponents will be marked for your squad. You can also use your Falcon Scout to open containers and pick up loot. Carry the loot to yourself or a teammate and then scout for more!\n\nTo help you easily control your Falcon Scout, your view will shift to behind it. This may leave you defenseless if you‚Äôre not fighting in a team, so be sure to find a hiding spot if you‚Äôre battling solo. Also, be careful where you‚Äôre flying, as the Falcon Scout is vulnerable to enemy attack. (See its remaining Health in its Health bar.) Because the Falcon Scout is controlled remotely, there‚Äôs a max distance it can fly from you, trackable in its distance bar.\n\nFalcon Scouts are findable from the ground, regular Chests, Oathbound Chests, and Supply Drops. There‚Äôs no limit as to how many times you can use the same Falcon Scout in a match.\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode.

Get Surfshark VPN at¬†https://surfshark.deals/undecided - Enter promo code UNDECIDED for 83% off and 3 extra months for FREE!  Permanent magnets are a critical resource for renewables, because the generators in some wind turbines and motors in electric vehicles rely on them to run. A Floridian high school student has just shown us how to make a better electric motor without rare earth magnets. Another company is using cloud computing to try to improve electric motor performance ‚Äî also without rare earths. There‚Äôs some exciting advances being made when it comes to electric motors, but how much of a difference can they make?\n\nCORRECTIONS: \n09:40: Text should read 750 RPM. \nI've trimmed a couple of short sections from the video that were creating confusion.  I didn't mean to imply that AC motors use magnets, but the wording during some moments made it sound like I was.

We took on everything the strip had to throw at us - heat, celebrity restaurant pasta dishes, serenading gondoliers - until we finally made it to the end. We came, we saw, we stayed - here are the final 14! What do you guys think?

This is the video I threatened to film at some point last year - and finally, it's here!! We‚Äôre big fans of Las Vegas and, in a moment of delirium, decided to stay in every hotel on the strip and provide the internet with a full report of our thoughts - just in case you need it. So, we booked a hotel room at every single one of the 33 casino mega resorts on the Strip - to review the rooms, vibes, and activities at each one. What happens in Vegas, gets uploaded to youtube, as the saying goes. What did you guys think? Which hotels were your favorite?\n\nA quick note - it looks like the Strat price title is missing, we paid $80 there on a Sunday!\n\nAlso, when we say \"Operated Independently\" - we mostly mean, not operated by MGM or Caesars!\n\nAlso also - we did receive some comped experiences at Treasure Island, Resorts World, and Circus Circus - but that did not influence our review and we did not promise them positive coverage. \n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/‚Äã\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nCarrie Roper\nMelissa Douglas\nClare Gelber\nJack Scott\nPhil Kinney\nElizabeth Pinotti\nMike Pearson III\nSteven Yonce\nGerman Torres\nCorey Glynn\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nRESEARCH by\nRachel Faulkner White \nSabrina Ford\n\n0:00 Intro\n2:56 Vegas Game Plan\n4:48 The Four Seasons\n8:04 The Delano\n10:01 Mandalay Bay\n12:57 The Luxor\n17:14 The Excalibur\n20:57 New York New York\n23:42 Park MGM\n25:23 The NoMad\n28:13 The Waldorf Astoria\n30:12 The Aria\n32:18 Bonus Hotel: Vdara\n32:47 The Cosmopolitan\n36:18 The Bellagio\n39:35 Caesars Palace\n41:06 The Nobu Hotel\n44:01 The Mirage\n46:27 Treasure Island\n48:58 Resorts World\n52:53 Circus Circus\n56:13 The Stratosphere\n\n#vegas #hotel #travel","title":"We Stayed At Every Hotel On The Vegas Strip","duration":3600,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e8woEkKmG8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0e8woEkKmG8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2611552}}

{"description":"THE MANDALORIAN SEASON 3 TRAILER BREAKDOWN!\nMan this was a great trailer. Let me first say, the show needs Cara Dune / Gina Carano back in it. Other than that, the trailer looked really good. I think this will be the best Mandalorian season yet. \nI can't wait to see more of Grogu's experience with Order 66 and how all the Mandalorians unite to fight against the remnants of the Empire. I wonder what happens to Moff Gideon and the dark saber, as it seems Mando Din Djarin doesn't have it on his belt anymore.\n\nThank you for watching today's video.
