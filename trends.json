{"description":"Let's find out if Pennzoil's motor oil (Pennzoil Synthetic Blend, Pennzoil Full Synthetic, Pennzoil Platinum and Pennzoil Ultra Platinum) are basically the oil.  All four oils tested sent to an independent oil lab for oil analysis. I tested oils for evaporative loss, lubricity or film strength, cold oil flow both new oil and after exposure to heat.  Additionally, in a final test, Pennzoil Ultra Platinum is exposed to 10% gasoline and another sample is exposed to antifreeze to see the impact it has on lubricity or oil performance.

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat.

{"description":"This is a journey that spanned multiple days as a total of 150,496 unique players controlled a single game of Pokémon Crystal. So huge thanks to @DougDoug allowed me to recreate my favorite historical event: Twitch Plays Pokémon.\n\nEven though this adventure originally started as a race between the Twitch Chat communities of other great trainers (@PointCrow, @CONEY, @Grand POOBear, @Linkus7, @Stanz, @Failboat, and DougDoug himself), it became something so much larger.

One day, I hope to venture off to create Twitch Plays Pokémon once again... as we continue onwards through the Kanto region... eventually...\n\nAlso, a massive shoutout to @Jaiden Animations, @Birdee’s , and even @PointCrow for stopping by during the stream that refused to end. :)\n\n➤ MERCH: http://pleasebuymymerch.com\n➤ TWITTER: https://twitter.com/alpharad\n➤ INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/alpharad\n#alpharad #pokemon #twitch\n\nVIDEO EDITOR:\n➤ me :)\n\nTHUMBNAIL ART:\n➤ Bobber: https://twitter.com/BobberWCC\n\nTHUMBNAIL DESIGN: \n➤ Crystel: http://twitter.com/crystei","title":"Recreating Twitch Plays Pokémon","duration":2026,"channel_id":"UCBODyKF0JMbUd6D9Bklyzbw","author":"Alpharad","date":"20220617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGrcJC3gR4I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SGrcJC3gR4I/hqdefault.webp?v=62a8dc17","content":{"View count":847914}}

{"description":"The rule is simple, when Steph Curry is in transition, you keep an eye on him at all times, even when he gives the ball up, because as we stop it right here, you already know that he’s going to curl and relocate out at the three point line, get the ball back, fire away and swish it.\nAnd this is just a death sentence, as Curry is lurking from behind, and all 3 Celtics are pointing but nobody picks up the deadliest shooter that this league has ever seen, so he raises up from the finals logo and literally announces to the entire arena that he’s going to get his 4th ring.\nSteph was unstoppable once again, but for this close out win, Golden State did something special, something that Boston could not find an answer for.\nLet me break down exactly how they won the championship. What up everybody, my name is Stefan and this is Heat Check. Let’s get into it.\nNo other player in the league has this much power and you know the fear is immeasurable just by looking at these fly bys as soon as he even blinks with his eyes, the overreaction to it is crazy, yet it totally makes sense.\nSo as a side effect of having to be that close to Steph, he uses it to penetrate inside and look at how easy this looks. \nJust saying that he had another spectacular game with 34 points 7 rebounds 7 assists on 57% from the field doesn’t do him justice, he could not be stopped. This looks like a walk in the park for him.\nBut just as impressive in this game was the fight that he showed on the defensive end.\nEarly on Boston tried to go at him and post him up in the paint, but he held his ground and as you can see, some of those possessions did not end well for the Celtics.\nESPN had a stat comparing his production on both ends of the floor. And it looks impressive as you can see. On defense he gave up 10 points as the primary guy and the Celtics shot 3 for 12 on those possessions, a miserable 25% along with 6 turnovers.\nThen we got Draymond Green. Check out how he baited the defense here by asking for the screen for Steph, and this should be a hand off but as Klay cuts inside, watch the laser pass in traffic right on the money and Thompson lays it in. Amazing.\nThen, these are the little things, the championship level plays, of sticking with it and tapping it out, subsequently leading to a three pointer. These are extra points.\nAnd he did it again as you can see this is a similar situation, and as he grabs the offensive rebound, finds Poole once again for another three.\nDraymond was even more imposing on defense. Look at the effort right here to stay in front of Jayson Tatum, and as soon as Looney comes out to help right here, Green will rotate over to switch it, doing it so quickly that he snatches this pass, and takes off on a fast break.\nAnd his blocks were even crazier.\nDraymond played by far his best game of the finals series, almost getting a triple double with 12 points, 12 rebounds, 8 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks. He was literally all over the floor and this was one of his vintage performances when the team needed it the most.\nAnd as you can see most of these plays are based on energy and effort.\nThat was the case as well with Andrew Wiggins who had another monster 2 way game, contributing on offense while pretty much shutting down Jayson Tatum on the other end of the floor. Wiggins has completely flipped the narrative about himself in a positive way of course, and I’m really happy for him.\nAnd what I said about energy and effort for both Green and Wiggins, this was the case for the entire Golden State team, and actually this was the one special thing that Boston couldn’t find an answer for. Which is staggering to me.\nEven tho they were bigger, the Celtics got outrebounded and gave away 15 offensive boards, which you can see how that contributed to extra possessions and points for the Warriors.\nNot only that, but Golden State’s activity and aggressiveness on defense forced 22 turnovers from Boston.\nIme Udoka’s squad did come out strong to start the game but as soon as the Warriors withstood that initial run, they went on a 21-0 blitz, built a big lead and they pretty much didn’t look back all the way to the final buzzer and the championship.\nSpeaking of that, this is an incredible storyline. Steph finally gets that finals MVP trophy that he deserved in 2015, and to shut all the haters who were saying that this is 1 thing that he’s missing in his career. And to say that for a guy that literally changed the game is ridiculous. But nevertheless he got it. And still puts the team first.\nThen Klay- after missing 2 and a half years to the most difficult injuries that a basketball player can have, and literally crying on the bench after games, to becoming a champion, that's a true dream of a comeback.\nAnd on the Boston side of things, first of all, this was a massive success beyond anyone’s expectations. With a new coach, and those early struggles, the talks about breaking up their star duo, to game 6 of the finals is nothing short of amazing.","title":"THIS Is EXACTLY How Boston Lost The Championship","duration":490,"channel_id":"UCmwxBk7Af9OnnloGZzp6JnQ","author":"Heat Check","date":"20220617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5KQ6J7UYT8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a5KQ6J7UYT8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":690924}}

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #travel #travelvlog #sailing\n00:00 Answering YOUR questions from Instagram!\n00:26 What has lost us the most subscribers?\n01:59 What are we most excited about right now?\n02:25 Are we having kids?\n03:40 What kind of phone plan do we use while traveling?\n05:00 How do I deal with my period while traveling?\n06:00 What would our future self tell us to start?\n06:53 Where would we choose to live forever?\n07:42 This is really bad\n08:55 Our biggest pet peeves about each other?\n10:54 Are we vegan?\n12:29 Will Riley and Elayna ever live on land?\n13:00 Van life vs. boat life?\n15:09 What happened to our 50 states goal?\n15:42 Do we feel secure with our future as Youtubers?\n16:28 Who's the better sailor?\n16:59 How do they raise kids on a boat?\n17:31 Is Elayna nice?\n18:02 I used too much fuel...\n18:33 Do we actually like other content creators?\n19:08 What are we like in real life?\n20:08 How to be intimate on a boat with 2 kids?....","title":"Are we having kids?

Black Adam was created by Bill Parker and C.C. Beck.  The film’s producers were Beau Flynn, Dwayne Johnson, Hiram Garcia and Dany Garcia, with Richard Brener, Walter Hamada, Dave Neustadter, Chris Pan, Eric McLeod, Geoff Johns and Scott Sheldon\n\n“Black Adam” smashes into theaters and IMAX internationally beginning 19 October 2022 and in North America on October 21, 2022.
