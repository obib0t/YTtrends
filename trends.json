{"description":"Lake Mead, which is located in Black Canyon approximately 30 miles east of Las Vegas U.S. is facing an unprecedented drought. As the drought rages on, the river and its reservoirs are facing a crisis. But, the water supply is drying up, which is having a profound effect on the region's economies.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing happening, as falling water levels reveal things previously hidden or lost, some with great implications for our well-being. What is happening to Lake Mead, and why is it drying up? And what sinister things and shocking discoveries lie beneath the water? Let's find out.\n\nLake Mead's profile and history.\nOn the Colorado river in the South-West of the U.S. lies the sprawling Lake Mead which straddles the states of Arizona and Nevada and is 24 miles east of Sin City, Las Vegas. An artificial reservoir formed by the iconic Hoover Dam, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States by volume when at its total capacity of 1.1 trillion cubic feet of water and is the second largest by surface area in the U.S. at 247 square miles, eclipsed only by Lake Powell, another reservoir upstream of Lake Mead on the Colorado river with a surface area of 254 square miles. \n\nWith such a large capacity, the Lake can hold the total annual flow of the Colorado river for two years. Lake Mead stretches 65 miles at full pool from the Hoover dam to Pearce Ferry; however, the Lake is relatively thin, with a maximum width of 9.3 miles. At full pool, Lake Mead has an elevation of about 1229 feet above sea level and a maximum depth of 532 ft. While not a particularly wide lake, it boasts a shoreline of 759 miles.\n\nterrifying discovery, nature discoveries, euphrates river, new discoveries 2022, euphrates river drying up, euphrates river drying up 2022, end of times, mississippi river drying up 2022, biblical, rapture, rapture dreams, rapture 2022, eden garden, garden of eden, mississippi river, biblical archaeology, revelations, end of times, the prophecy, bible prophecy, lake mead, lake mead water level 2022, lake mead update, drying up, drought, climate change, supply chain, hoover dam, lake powell,","title":"What JUST HAPPENED With Lake Mead SHOCKED Scientists!","duration":777,"channel_id":"UCpIhGdHkOJ2sHkqM3YNIKsA","author":"Nature Discoveries","date":"20230108","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl97t2PcC8w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cl97t2PcC8w/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":616375}}

I need to learn how to build a Minecraft house. Maybe I need to watch a YouTube minecraft house tutorial. Then I'll need to figure out how to put a bed in the house and sleep my first night. Hopefully, I can survive without running into any creepers, hackers, or zombies. \n\nIf I become a true Minecraft Pro, maybe I can play with one of my favorite Minecraft YouTubers.

{"description":"A Day in the Life of a Japanese Game Designer also know in Japan as a Game Planner for a Japanese Development Company.  This is life working in Tokyo in the Japan Game Industry developing games for mobile devices.  It includes the average work day and typical working hours of a Japanese office.  If  you want to learn what it is like working in the Japan game industry then this video should help provide insight on the type of work life and work culture in Japan.  Shuta works as a Lead Game Designer aka Game Planner at Colopl. One of the largest mobile game developers in Japan popular for making casual mobile games like Shironkeo Project, Meow Meow and Star Acres. With about 800 employees in their Tokyo office, their creative teams produce a wide variety of mobile games.  As a Japanese game planner, it‚Äôs important to have strong management and communication skills.  It‚Äôs not enough to be creative and come up with ideas, but a planner must also be able to organize these ideas, create proposals and specification documents in order to effectively communicate their ideas to their teams.  Apparently, it took a total of 7 years of development to complete the game Neko Golf. In fact, the development itself froze after 4 years, but then was later restarted and the team restructured when Shuta joined the team 3 years ago.  For many playing the game, they‚Äôll probably never truly understand how much time went into creating it, but for the team I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a great sense of completing the game. \n\n\"NEKO GOLF -Anime GOLF-\"\nDownload the app here!\n ‚ñΩEnglish\nhttps://colopl.page.link/jpRZ\n‚ñΩÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥(Korean)\nhttps://colopl.page.link/BWEk\n‚ñΩÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá(Chinese)\nhttps://colopl.page.link/gR7A\n\n„Ç∑„É•„Éü„É¨„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„Ç¥„É´„ÉïÊíÆÂΩ±ÂçîÂäõ\nBAGUS ÂÖ≠Êú¨Êú®Â∫ó\n\nWatch more of my Japan Day in the Life videos:\n- https://tokyozebra.com/ditl\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?
