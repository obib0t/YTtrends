{"description":"QUEEN rediscovered track featuring Freddie Mercury ‘FACE IT ALONE’ arrives as digital single release Thursday October 13\nPrecedes arrival of Queen ‘The Miracle Collector’s Edition’ coming November 18 \n\nPre-order The Miracle-Collector's Edition: https://Queen.lnk.to/TheMiracle\nDownload/Stream Face It Alone: https://Queen.lnk.to/FaceItAlone\n\nHaving generated a media firestorm back in the summer when band members Brian May and Roger Taylor first leaked news of a rediscovered Queen song featuring Freddie Mercury being considered for possible release, the highly anticipated ‘lost’ track, ‘Face It Alone’, drops as a simultaneous worldwide single release Thursday 13 October, 11.15am BST.\n\nThe track’s existence was first revealed by May and Taylor in a BBC radio interview at their appearance at this year’s Royal Jubilee concert at which they performed the opening with their regular singer Adam Lambert, with Roger Taylor describing it as “a little gem from Freddie that we’d kind of forgotten about”, with Brian May saying “it’s beautiful, it’s touching.”\n\nThe track’s arrival as a single leads in a November 18 release of a new revisiting of the band’s 13th album, The Miracle, the band’s penultimate to be released in Freddie Mercury’s lifetime, which now becomes available in a lavish 8-disc Queen The Miracle Collector’s Edition box set format.\n\nAmong its contents, the expanded set includes The Miracle Sessions: an hour-plus disc of further previously unreleased recordings, including six unpublished songs. Just as tantalising for fans, the audio includes the band’s candid spoken exchanges on the studio floor in London and Montreux, giving the most revealing window yet into the four members’ creative process and the joy, in-jokes and banter on their return to working together.\n\n‘Face It Alone’ was originally recorded during the band’s historic 1988 sessions for that album, a prolific period which saw the band lay down around 30 tracks, many of which were never released, but remained among those that didn’t make the final album cut. It was rediscovered when the band’s production and archive team returned to those sessions to work on The Miracle box set reissue.\n\n“We’d kind of forgotten about this track,” admits Roger Taylor, “but there it was, this little gem. It’s wonderful, a real discovery. It’s a very passionate piece”.\n\nThe single will be the first new song featuring Freddie Mercury released in over 8 years. On 2014’s Queen Forever album the band included three previously unheard tracks with Mercury, including ‘Let Me in Your Heart Again,’ ‘Love Kills’ and ‘There Must Be More to Life Than This.’\n\nSpeaking of the rediscovered track, Brian May says: “I’m happy that our team were able to find this track.  After all these years, it’s great to hear all four of us … yes, Deacy is there too … working in the studio on a great song idea which never quite got completed … until now!”\n\nSubscribe to the official Queen channel Here https://Queen.lnk.to/Subscribe\nWatch more: https://Queen.lnk.to/OfficialMusicVideos\n\nAbout Queen:\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.

{"description":"The video you have all been waiting for is here! Our wedding vlog! We had so many people who filmed and helped make this video happen. Dakota and I were so excited to spend the weekend in California, and to be able to see all of our family and friends! We flew out on Wednesday, and spent the day prepping and hanging out before the chaos of everything. On Thursday it was time for our rehearsal and rehearsal dinner! We wanted to have things a little more casual than normal so we did a small get together with family and friends roasting s'mores and eating snacks! Then of course Friday came along (wedding day) and we spent the day getting ready and then getting MARRIED! \n\nWe have so much footage so we are making a WHOLE OTHER VIDEO for the ceremony AND the rehearsal speeches, but everything else we vlogged is in this video! Hopefully y’all enjoy watching the day as much as we enjoyed living it! \n\n❤️'s - Brooklyn\n\nYou can check out our skincare products HERE: https://www.walmart.com/browse/beauty/itk-skincare/1085666_3316357_5625401\n\n\nDon't forget to follow us on other platforms where we post daily!\n   📸  Instagram | http://instagram.com/brooklynandbailey\n   ⏰  Tik Tok | @BrooklynAndBailey\n   🐥  Twitter | http://twitter.com/brookandbailey\n   👤  Facebook | http://facebook.com/brooklynandbailey\n   👻  SnapChat | http://snapchat.com/add/BrookAndBailey\n   🎶  Spotify | https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Y8tcJEqYuIDSNAZEqu9Nd\n   ☁️  SoundCloud | http://soundcloud.com/brooklynandbailey\n\nFTC Disclaimer: This is not a sponsored video.\n\n\n💥HELP US OUT💥: You can help us translate our uploads, and get credit below each video!

{"description":"meet M3GAN. your new best friend.\n\nM3GAN - official trailer\nonly in theaters january 13\n\nFrom the most prolific minds in horror—James Wan, the filmmaker behind the Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring franchises, and Blumhouse, the producer of the Halloween films, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man—comes a fresh new face in terror. \nM3GAN is a marvel of artificial intelligence, a life-like doll programmed to be a child’s greatest companion and a parent’s greatest ally. Designed by brilliant toy-company roboticist Gemma (Get Out’s Allison Williams), M3GAN can listen and watch and learn as she becomes friend and teacher, playmate and protector, for the child she is bonded to. \n\nWhen Gemma suddenly becomes the caretaker of her orphaned 8-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw, The Haunting of Hill House), Gemma’s unsure and unprepared to be a parent. Under intense pressure at work, Gemma decides to pair her M3GAN prototype with Cady in an attempt to resolve both problems—a decision that will have unimaginable consequences. \n\nProduced by Jason Blum and James Wan, M3GAN is directed by award-winning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone (Housebound), from a screenplay by Akela Cooper (Malignant, The Nun 2) based on a story by Akela Cooper and James Wan. \n\nThe film also stars Ronny Chieng (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings), Brian Jordan Alvarez (Will & Grace), Jen Van Epps (Cowboy Bebop), Lori Dungey (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, extended edition) and Stephane Garneau-Monten (Straight Forward).\n\nUniversal Pictures and Blumhouse present an Atomic Monster production in association with Divide/Conquer. The film’s executive producers are Allison Williams, Mark Katchur, Ryan Turek, Michael Clear, Judson Scott, Adam Hendricks and Greg Gilreath.","title":"M3GAN - official trailer","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20221011","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRb4U99OU80","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/BRb4U99OU80/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":7481436}}

{"description":"LEE CHAE YEON (이채연) - HUSH RUSH MV\n\nLEE CHAE YEON(이채연) 1st Mini Album \"HUSH RUSH\" has been released.\n\n이채연의 첫 미니 앨범 'HUSH RUSH'는 고성에 갇힌 뱀파이어가 잠에서 깨어나 세상에 첫 발을 내디딜 때 느낄 짜릿한 전율을 발칙한 상상력으로 그려낸 앨범이다. \n기존의 틀에 얽매이지 않은 MZ 세대의 당당함을 이채연만의 독보적 표현력으로 풀어냈다.\n\n특유의 키치하면서도 감성적인 무드가 엿보이는 이번 앨범을 통해 독보적 올라운드 솔로 아티스트로 거듭난 이채연의 성장을 보여줘 글로벌 음악팬들의 관심이 집중되고 있다.\n\n동명의 타이틀곡 'HUSH RUSH'는 이채연만의 섬세한 보컬이 귀를 사로잡는 팝 넘버다. \n달빛 아래에서 눈을 뜬 뱀파이어가 자유롭게 춤을 추듯, 무대 위에 오를 때 가장 나다운 자유로움을 느끼고 그런 내 모습을 사랑하게 되는 ‘나’에 대한 메시지를 담았다. \n더욱이 그동안 시선을 사로잡는 압도적인 퍼포먼스 실력으로 남다른 존재감을 발산해온 만큼, 이채연만의 차별화된 독보적 무대를 완성해낼 것으로 기대를 모은다.  \n\n더불어 오랜 시간 함께 해온 팬들과의 관계를 ‘롱디 커플’에 비유한 80년대 신스팝 장르의 ‘Danny’, \n그루브 있는 베이스와 한층 더 성숙해진 이채연의 보컬이 돋보이는 팝 장르 곡 ‘Aquamarine’, \n파트마다 변하는 악기 구성과 다양한 보컬 베리에이션이 매력적인 댄스곡 ‘Same But Different’까지 총 4개의 트랙이 수록되어 있다.\n\n지금까지와는 또 다른 색깔로 다시 태어난 이채연, \n새로움으로 가득 채운 첫 솔로 앨범 ‘HUSH RUSH’를 통해 앞으로의 무한한 가능성을 당당히 증명해낼 준비를 마쳤다. \n\n\n1. HUSH RUSH\nComposed by Dwayne “Dem Jointz” Abernathy Jr., 라이언전, Cristina Gallo\nKorean Lyrics by 조윤경\nArranged by Dem Jointz for U Made Us What We Are LLC, 라이언전\n\n이채연만의 섬세한 보컬이 돋보이는 ‘HUSH RUSH’는 중독성 있는 베이스로 귀를 사로잡는 팝 넘버다. 귀에 꽂히는 캐치한 훅에 조화로운 코러스와 애드립으로 풍성함을 더해 완성도를 높였다. 달빛 아래에서 춤을 추며 자유로움을 느끼고, 그런 내 모습을 사랑하게 되는 ‘나’의 이야기를 담았다. ‘무대에서 바라본 눈 부신 빛’은 이채연을 기다려준 모든 ‘너’의 눈빛이었고, 언제까지나 그 빛 속에서 춤을 추고 싶다는 이채연의 메시지가 인상적이다.\n\n\n2. Danny\nComposed by 라이언전, Celine Svanbäck, Jeppe London Bilsby, Daniel Schulz, Daniel Salcedo Mirza\nKorean Lyrics by 빨간머리앤, 전율이 (앤이야기)\nArranged by 라이언전, Jeppe London Bilsby\n\n독특하고 중독되는 신시사이저 사운드의 빌드업으로 빈틈없이 꽉 찬 음악을 들려주는 ‘Danny’는 80년대의 레트로한 감성을 고스란히 담은 신스팝 곡이다. 오랜 시간 함께 해온 팬들과의 관계를, 멀리 떨어져 있지만 항상 서로를 응원하며 다정한 안부를 묻는 ‘롱디 커플’로 표현했다. 다채로운 변주와 리드미컬한 훅이 힘차고 밝은 에너지를 선사한다.\n\n\n3. Aquamarine\nComposed by 라이언전, Gustav Nyström, Isabelle Z.\nKorean Lyrics by 빨간머리앤 (앤이야기)\nArranged by 라이언전, Gustav Nyström\n\n‘Aquamarine’은 그루브 있는 베이스로부터 시작해 감미로운 보컬로 채워지는 팝 장르의 곡이다. 바닷속 푸른빛을 따라 자유롭게 헤엄치는 꿈을 통해 느끼는 다채로운 감정을 노래했다. 초반의 집중도부터 후반부의 풍성함까지 완벽한 밸런스로 다채롭게 표현한 이채연 특유의 섬세하면서도 힘 있는 보이스가 성숙한 감성을 더하고, 완성도를 높였다.\n\n\n4. Same But Different\nComposed by 라이언전, Anton Rundberg, Julia Karlsson, Kristin Carpenter\nKorean Lyrics by 서지음\nArranged by 라이언전, Anton Rundberg\n\n‘Same But Different’는 파트마다 변하는 악기 구성과 다양한 보컬 베리에이션이 매력적인 디스코와 신스팝 기반의 댄스곡이다. 뜨거운 여름이 지나고 계절과 계절의 사이, 그 서늘한 공기를 어딘가 달라진 두 사람의 관계에 비유한 가사가 듣는 재미를 더한다.\n\n\n#이채연 #LEECHAEYEON #HUSHRUSH","title":"LEE CHAE YEON (이채연) - HUSH RUSH MV","duration":221,"channel_id":"UC_pwIXKXNm5KGhdEVzmY60A","author":"Stone Music Entertainment","date":"20221012","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MKcY5wTcpY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6MKcY5wTcpY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2324502}}

While often associated with nuclear weapons and fallout, radiation is much more than the scary disasters we read about in the news. Simply put, radiation is just the transmission of energy through particles or waves through space or material mediums, meaning all the warmth, light, and colors you experience in this beautiful world are a direct result of radiation!\n\nI hope you enjoy this surface level dive into the topic of radiation, but please, if this topic interests you feel free to peruse a handful of the sources I used below: \n\nhttps://www.aocopm.org/assets/documents/10-31-11_Basic_Course_III_Orlando/ionizing%20an%20non.pdf\n\nhttps://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/UVB\n\nhttps://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/science-101/what-is-a-geiger-counter.html\n\nhttp://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/17793/1/DP70461.pdf\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight\n\nhttps://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-electromagnetic-radiation-and-vs-nuclear-radiation/\n\nhttps://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/intro_9_5.html\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/training/products/RN/page4976.html\n\nhttps://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l3_p4.html\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome\n\nhttps://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html\n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-basics\n\nhttps://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Furman_University/CHM101%3A_Chemistry_and_Global_Awareness_(Gordon)/05%3A_Basics_of_Nuclear_Science/5.04%3A_Ionizing_Radiation_and_Non-ionizing_Radiation\n\nhttps://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Sacramento_City_College/SCC%3A_CHEM_330_-_Adventures_in_Chemistry_(Alviar-Agnew)/11%3A_Nuclear_Chemistry/11.06%3A_Penetrating_Power_of_Radiation\n\nhttps://www.mirion.com/learning-center/radiation-safety-basics/types-of-ionizing-radiation","title":"Radiation in a Nutshell","duration":882,"channel_id":"UCvQ4C0f9_OWRf1uyobwqOwA","author":"BlueJay","date":"20221011","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMuYohlRlfY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zMuYohlRlfY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":374519}}

{"description":"So recently I got hurt in my last 3v3 basketball game and got another concussion. Due to my history of concussions and the symptoms I have currently, I've decided to withdraw myself from the 3v3 league and to officially quit playing basketball competitively anywhere for GOOD. This decision wasn't easy to accept but after talking with doctors, my family and friends this is the best choice for me and my mental health.  I lost my collegiate scholarship for this same injury so I've been through this kind of heartbreak before. Although this is the end for me playing basketball, I still plan to utilize my talents and expertise with basketball in my future content. I'm a firm believer in if one thing you do fails, you will soon have an opportunity to try to succeed at something else. Thank you for all the love and support.

{"description":"Alex Iwobi gave Everton a dream start but the Blues’ unbeaten run came to an end after a narrow 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Goodison Park.\n\nBuoyed by two straight Premier League victories and without tasting defeat in seven matches in all competitions, Frank Lampard’s men looked to be on their way to more success when Iwobi stroked home a sweet 25-yard finish past David de Gea with just five minutes on the clock.\n\nThat proved to be the peak moment, however, with Everton the makers of their own downfall as mistakes in possession enabled Anthony to level on 14 minutes before substitute Cristiano Ronaldo netted his 700th club goal just before the break.\n\nThe Toffees were much improved in the second half – with the welcome return of Dominic Calvert-Lewin off the bench – but they could not find a leveller despite a spirited response.\n\nSubscribe to Everton Football Club's official YouTube Channel: http://bit.ly/2wtCEbB\n\nFollow us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/everton\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/everton\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/everton\n\nWelcome to the Official Everton Football Club YouTube channel.
