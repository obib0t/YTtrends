{"description":"Portugal and Uruguay faced off in their second matches of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In the first half both teams struggled to score. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo was itching to get the ball in the net. In the 54th minute in the second half, a goal was credited to him at first. Later in the match, the credit was given to Bruno Fernandes. Uruguay tried relentlessly to equalize the score but failed. Bruno Fernandes would add another goal, via penalty kick, in stoppage time.

{"description":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) 5th Mini Album [HARMONY : SET IN]\n'Back Down' MV\n\n조화를 이루기 위한 방법은 다양하다. 진정한 조화의 시작은 서로 갈등을 겪어도, 더 완벽한 세상을 위해 모두 함께 한 단계 위로 나아가는 것. P1Harmony(피원하모니)는 다섯 번째 미니 앨범 ‘HARMONY : SET IN’을 통해 각자 다른 가치관 속에서 온전히 하나가 되기 위한 진정한 조화의 발걸음을 내디딘다.\n\n미니 5집 타이틀곡 ‘Back Down’은 언제 어디서든 겁내어 물러서지 말고 함께 헤쳐 나가자는 단합과 전진의 메시지를 담고 있다. ‘이겨 낼 수 있어 Together / Back Down, 절대 Don’t worry’ 등 완전한 조화의 모습을 향해 노력하고자 하는 피원하모니의 의지를 보여준다.\n\n타이틀곡 ‘Back Down’ 외에도 P1Harmony의 에너지와 포부를 보여주는 수록곡들이 담겼다. 친한 친구들과 함께 신나게 즐기자는 팝 댄스곡 ‘BFF (Best Friends Forever)’, 세상을 놀래고자 하는 멤버들의 자신감이 돋보이는 ‘Secret Sauce’, 나만의 색을 보여주자는 다짐이 담긴 힙합곡 ‘One And Only’, 우리는 결국 목표를 이루어 낼 것이라는 가사가 인상적인 ‘태양을 삼킨 아이 (Look At Me Now)’, 멤버 지웅이 작사·작곡에 참여한 미디엄 팝 발라드곡 ‘배낭여행 (Better Together)’까지 총 여섯 곡이 수록됐다. 특히 멤버 인탁, 종섭은 새 앨범 전곡 작사에 참여하며 P1Harmony의 이야기를 직접 꾸려냈다.  \n\n서로를 향한 믿음과 우정으로 단합한 피원하모니. 그들이 꿈꾸는 더 나은 세상은 결국 눈 앞에 펼쳐질지, 완벽한 하모니를 향한 출발점인 ‘HARMONY PROTOCOL’만이 그 답을 알고 있다.\n\nThere are various ways to achieve harmony. The beginning of true harmony is to move altogether to a next level for a more perfect world, even if there are conflicts. Through the 5th Mini Album ‘HARMONY : SET IN’, P1Harmony takes a step of true harmony to become completely one in different values.\n\nThe title song of the 5th Mini Album, ‘Back Down’, contains a message of unity and moving forward to get through together without backing down from the fear at anytime and anywhere. It shows P1Harmony’s will to strive toward complete harmony through ‘We can get through Together / Back Down, Never Don’t worry’.\n\nIn addition to the title song ‘Back Down’, the album contains B-side songs that show P1Harmony's energy and ambition. Total of 6 songs are included in this album: the pop dance song ‘BFF (Best Friends Forever)’ to enjoy with the best friends, ‘Secret Sauce’ showing the members’ confidence to surprise the world, ‘One And Only’, a hip-hop song with a determination to show one’s own color, ‘태양을 삼킨 아이 (Look At Me Now)’, with impressive lyrics that says we will eventually achieve our goal, and ‘배낭여행 (Better Together)’ a medium pop ballad song in which member JIUNG participated in penning the lyrics and composing the song. In particular, members INTAK and JONGSEOB participated in penning the lyrics of all songs in this new album and created the story of P1Harmony themselves.\n\nP1Harmony, united by faith and friendship toward each other. Only ‘HARMONY PROTOCOL’, the starting point for perfect harmony, knows the answer to whether the better world they dream of will eventually unfold in front of them.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony \n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony \n▷OFFICIAL TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_official \n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_members \n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official \n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony \n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #5th_Mini_Album #HARMONY #SETIN #Back_Down","title":"P1Harmony (피원하모니) - 'Back Down' MV","duration":226,"channel_id":"UCZECMCJJJE47ei170XCXgdA","author":"FNCEnt","date":"20221129","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE_I_HunRWQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hE_I_HunRWQ/hqdefault.webp?v=63844b7e","content":{"View count":350235}}

{"description":"When Jennifer Lopez wrote ‘This is Me...Then’ she had just met the love of her life: Ben Affleck. After much public scrutiny and an engagement ring, the two famously called off their wedding. Now, 20 years later, Jennifer Lopez is married to Ben and sitting down with Zane Lowe to discuss her upcoming ninth studio album ‘This is Me…Now’. \n\nJ Lo reflects on the conversation behind the title of the album 'This Is Me...Then', which spawned the hit \"Jenny from the Block\" and captured the chapter of her life where she met her soulmate. In a wide-ranging conversation, she discusses the uncanny experience of writing the future of her love story with Ben, feeling most musically inspired when she is in love, facing heartbreak publicly, and reuniting with the love of her life.\n\n‘This is Me…Now’ is Jennifer coming from a healed perspective and wants to let people know how in love she truly is.\n\nListen to Jennifer Lopez on Apple Music: https://apple.co/JLoYT\n\n00:00 - “This Is Me… Then”\n10:10 - Relationship with Ben Affleck\n17:45 - Break Up and Self Love\n29:27 - Recording New Music\n38:39 - Representing Latino Culture\n45:22 -  “This Is Me… Now”\n\nSubscribe to Apple Music: https://apple.co/AppleMusicYT\n\nFollow Apple Music:\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@applemusic\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/applemusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/applemusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/applemusic\n\nWatch more Apple Music: \nWhat’s New: https://apple.co/2VFatTU\nApple Music Up Next: https://apple.co/2MLktXE\nInterviews: https://apple.co/32WnrPV\nWhat’s Trending: https://apple.co/2Meq89t\n\nApple Music lets you listen to millions of songs, online or off, totally ad-free.

After Ammar took Seekers on adventures this year and also sponsored Nelly Attar to climb K2, I would like to also say thank you to those who support us through Seek Discomfort this holiday by taking a small group of 3 of you who purchase from Seek this Holiday on an adventure somewhere next year. We will contact the 3 adventurers by January 31st. If you have already purchased this holiday, you're already good to go :) if you'd like a chance to join me, you know where to go! ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ \n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort\n\nWhen it comes to what happened at the end.. It really shook me, we felt with the local team that we'd really prepared the best we could but sometimes unexpected problems like this one can happen. We've checked several times and everyone there is fine, they were really just looking for me. Nothing like this had really happened before even though I have experience traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and I understand that there are things you can and cannot do.

This upsets me as much as it does you, and as frustrating as it might be to hear, I really do think it’s right. There’s just too much evidence surrounding Baby being the one working from the shadows to run Fazbear Entertainment to ignore. I believe she’s doing her best to follow through on the promise she made back in FNAF 6, “I will make you proud, Daddy.” So lower your pitchforks, put out those torches… and hear me out with this one.\n\nCredit to @Jaze Cinema  for the animation ►  https://youtu.be/0LscZnLfNEc\n\nMake Sure You Grab My New Wearable ARG Jacket From TheoryWear Before It’s Gone! ► https://bit.ly/3tUevKi \n\nGet Your TheoryWear! ►  https://theorywear.com/\nCheck out the Reddit! ► https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/   \nSUBSCRIBE to Catch all the Theories! ► https://goo.gl/kQWHkJ    \n\nNeed Royalty Free Music for your Content?

{"description":"Only the second time that an undefeated Michigan and an undefeated Ohio State have faced off in the final game of the regular season led to one of the most highly anticipated college football game in years. No. 3 Michigan traveled to Columbus, Ohio to take on No. 2 Ohio State in ‘The Shoe’. The Buckeyes came out on fire, until a few long touchdowns from the Wolverines calmed the nerves. Marvin Harrison Jr. caught a TD just before halftime to give Ohio State the 20-17 edge going into the break. In the second half, everything changed. J.J. McCarthy looked outstanding. He finished the game with 263 pass yards and three touchdowns. Donovan Edwards stepped up huge, including the final two dagger touchdown runs to finish the game with 216 rush yards. No. 3 Michigan defeated No. 2 Ohio State in Columbus for the first time since 2000.
