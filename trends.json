His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.

{"description":"yEAAHHH. So, after wasting 20 bucks on Clawee and other virtual claw machine apps, basically I went nuts and bought an ACTUAL claw machine. It's currently hanging out in my art room and I'm hoping to eventually fill it with cool prizes like squishies, plushies and other cute items that are fun to customize. However, there is oneeeee little problem. This claw machine is NOT my style at all. SOOO. I am going to spend a couple weeks customizing the claw machine itself first.

{"description":"Welcome Back ladies and gents to the worst skyrim build ever created! It is perfectly balanced because today we have done todd howard proud by playing skyrim the true way Bethesda intended!  Say hello to the worst underpowered and overpowered character build the world has ever seen. Gone are the days of OP stealth archer Skyrim characters. Say hello to the new negative Armor rating heavy builds that can deal infinite damage upon taking damage but usually can only take 1 hit before they are defeated by a level 1 wolf. We have built perfectly balanced skyrim forks that 1 hit dragons and gods. Whilst building skyrim necromancy characters that can raise an army of the dead. But today we build a noodle that whilst having infinite health will still receive infinite damage. A Perfect Counter. So let us break skyrim together! And provided this video does well I think its time the spiffing brit takes on skyrim multiplayer! \n\nso it's time for me to flex my exploit skills and break the game with infinite armor. My power is unstoppable and I will defeat this impossible challenge with all of my skyrim illegal experience to discover if this game is broken or can you beat perfectly balanced gameplay! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced game series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.
