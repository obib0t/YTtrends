We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

{"description":"This September the legend begins. #TheRingsOfPower\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien‚Äôs pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N√∫menor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.\n\nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

{"description":"Go inside Madden NFL 23 with a deep dive into Franchise mode updates. Pre-order now: http://x.ea.com/73774\n\nWith new player Motivations and Tags in Free Agency, streamlined Scouting features, and enhanced transaction logic, Madden NFL 23 Franchise offers more authenticity and immersion. \n\nNew in Madden 23 Franchise:\nMotivations: Whether it is a team's chances of making the Super Bowl, its location, or its roster makeup, new player Motivations help determine why a player decides to sign with a particular team. Examples of new Motivations include: Close to Home, Franchise QB, Super Bowl Contender, and Big Market.\n\nTags: From winning the MVP award to incentives for signing veteran players as mentors, new Player Tags directly impact Free Agent logic, trade logic, draft logic, and player progression. Tags like Award Winner, Mentor, and Day 1 Starter give players more personality, drive up market interest value, and can provide XP bonuses during training.\n\nContracts: Come to terms with new contract offer presets that help streamline the negotiation process. Player Friendly, Team Friendly, Neutral, and Very Player Friendly offer presets that each come with their own risk and reward. New Rollover Cap allows you to carry over unused cap space to the next year. \n\nFree Agent Hub: The new Free Agency Hub is where you place offers, compete with other teams, manage Free Agent signings, view player Motivations and Tags, and more. You can also see players‚Äô interest levels in signing with your Franchise. Now you can place an offer without advancing the week, which offers more opportunities to negotiate with Free Agent targets each week.\n\nScouting: With the ability to scout multiple positions at each stage as well as extra scouts to evaluate any position, you can gain important insight about more prospects faster. New Weighted Attribute Reveals uncover essential ratings first, for the position you‚Äôre scouting ‚Äì like Throw Power for a QB instead of Break Tackle. \n\nDraft Classes: A complete overhaul of Draft Classes includes the addition of more than 30 new player generators, and tuning of existing ones. Now you can find unique and fun players in every round. Discover rare generational prospects who have a high overall rating and will be guaranteed an X-Factor ‚Äì a valuable addition as you develop your Franchise for long-term success.\n\nMadden NFL 23 is available worldwide August 19, 2022\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 ‚Äì 00:25 ‚Äì Intro \n00:26 ‚Äì 00:37 - Free Agency Goals\n00:38 ‚Äì 02:15 ‚Äì Player Motivations\n02:16 ‚Äì 03:11 ‚Äì Player Tags \n03:12 ‚Äì 04:46 ‚Äì Free Agency Hub\n04:47 ‚Äì 05:07 ‚Äì Contracts \n05:08 ‚Äì 06:01 ‚Äì Scouting \n06:02 ‚Äì 06:32 ‚Äì Draft Class Tuning\n06:33 ‚Äì 07:16 ‚Äì Trade & Draft Logic\n07:17 ‚Äì End ‚Äì UI Improvements","title":"Madden 23 Franchise Deep Dive","duration":482,"channel_id":"UCPpddbTbOr_uWWQT9Pw1rbA","author":"EA SPORTS MADDEN NFL","date":"20220715","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SWvkVBOAA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/44SWvkVBOAA/hqdefault.webp?v=62d01fee","content":{"View count":99699}}

{"description":"Discover how NASA engineers built and launched the most ambitious telescope of all time.\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.pbs.org/nova/ | #NOVAPBS\n\nHow did NASA engineers build and launch the most ambitious telescope of all time? Follow the dramatic story of the James Webb Space Telescope‚Äîthe most complex machine ever launched into space. If it works, scientists believe that this new eye on the universe will peer deeper back in time and space than ever before to the birth of galaxies, and may even be able to ‚Äúsniff‚Äù the atmospheres of exoplanets as we search for signs of life beyond Earth. But getting it to work is no easy task. The telescope is far bigger than its predecessor, the famous Hubble Space Telescope, and it needs to make its observations a million miles away from Earth‚Äîso there will be no chance to go out and fix it. That means there‚Äôs no room for error; the most ambitious telescope ever built needs to work perfectly. Meet the engineers making it happen and join them on their high stakes journey to uncover new secrets of the universe.\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

{"description":"Sponsor: be quiet!'s Silent Base 802 https://geni.us/DaGYu\nIntel's new Arc GPUs are starting to roll-out. We're looking at the Intel Arc A750 briefly, but mostly talking with Intel Graphics Engineer Tom Petersen (formerly NVIDIA) about how Arc clock control works, some of the architecture, PCIe x8 decisions, driver challenges, and more. The discussion spans from high-level basic information (like naming schemes and nomenclature for the Arc GPUs) to mid-depth technical information (like block diagrams for graphics slices and Xe cores, vectors, and SIMD topics). Because Intel is relatively new to the desktop graphics space, we needed some more architectural information and foundational knowledge to better understand the products as we review them.

{"description":"Funny Marco welcomes Orlando Brown, an American actor, rapper and singer. He is best known for his roles as Cadet Kevin 'Tiger' Dunne in Major Payne, 3J Winslow in ‚ÄúFamily Matters,‚Äù Max in ‚ÄúTwo of a Kind,‚Äù Damey Wayne \"Waynehead\" in Waynehead, Sticky Webb in ‚ÄúThe Proud Family,‚Äù Cornelius Fillmore in ‚ÄúFillmore!,‚Äù Eddie Thomas in ‚ÄúThat's So Raven,‚Äù and Frankie in ‚ÄúEddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off.‚Äù \n \nIn this episode the antics and tension are felt immediately as the crew is late setting up and Orlando blows in the mic seeming to frustrate Marco who in turns starts interrogating Orlando about his experience working with Will Smith, which Orlando denies. Not one to take one word answers, Marco goes deep and asks Orlando about his past and if he has fumbled the bag. Orlando responds by saying he is all about love. As the interview continues Marco asks Orlando about his drip. The random questions from Marco seem to baffle and frustrate Orlando. Marco then asks the question on how Orlando feels about going from Disney to TMZ. Orlando responds that is part of the lifestyle of growing up under the spotlight. Orlando also says Marco owns the Shade Room and the Shade Room plays him. An argument starts with the crew as Orlando speaks in the camera to speak directly to The Shade Room. Marco then asks Orlando about Raven-Symone. Orlando calls Marco Raven and starts to sing the theme song to ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs So Raven.‚Äù Marco then gets into Orlando‚Äôs rap career playing one of Orlando‚Äôs songs. Marco asks about his lyrics and Orlando talks about how Debbie Allen inspired him. Marco then shows Orlando a publicity shot of Orlando at Disney next to a mugshot. Orlando points out on his mugshot that he has a tattoo of Raven on his neck. Marco then asks Orlando about Mariah Carey for which Orlando says that her real name is Danielle and he would never sleep with his buddy Nick Cannon‚Äôs girl. The antics continue as Marco asks about Orlando‚Äôs high speed chase. Orlando gives a message to 50 Cent about being down. The producer comments that Orlando has a lifetime contract with Disney. Orlando vehemently denies the claim. Orlando claims Bill Cosby owns Disney and says R Kelly is guilty and he saw the tapes. As usual chaos ensues as Orlando seems patient but confused as he eats a snack. Orlando talks about the Straight Outta Compton feature that he was cut out of. Marco asks a question about Lil Bow Wow and Orlando makes the claim that Lil Bow Wow has ‚Äúbomb ass pussy.‚Äù  \nThe crew is shocked at the comment but Marco stays professional. The crew is having problems as the sound man gets fired. Orlando starts to petition Lil Wayne‚Äôs manager Cortez Bryant, a guest in the crowd, for representation, making for an awkward moment. The random questions continue as Marco seems to be fed up.  \n \nExecutive Producers: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries IG @TheRealDaveMays @IGoByBrettJ\n \nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @MattAblesPromotions\n \nDirector of Photography: Rashid ‚ÄúCruz‚Äù Terry\n \nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco\n \nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Orlando Brown talks TMZ, Disney, Raven Simone, 50 Cent plea, DMs Mariah Carey, Lil Bow Wow + More","duration":1532,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20220712","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH2yzHSliu0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YH2yzHSliu0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":566158}}
