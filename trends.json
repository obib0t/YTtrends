{"description":"Starfield reviewed on PC and Xbox Series X by Dan Stapleton.\nIt’s never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours, but that’s very much the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it. There are a lot of forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management, and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive. I’m glad that I powered through the early hours, because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got rolling, combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I’d finished the main story after around 60 hours. Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there’s still an immense amount of quality roleplaying quests and interesting NPCs out there, waiting to be stumbled across, and the pull to seek it out is strong.","title":"Starfield Review","duration":742,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMMNkfSQuiU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/nMMNkfSQuiU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1289032}}

Well, Mat’s got hands-on with the car to take a closer look. \n\nIn terms of the design, there are a few notable changes. Up top, there are a pair of slimmer, sleeker headlights, and there’s also a big central vent as part of the bumper. This helps give it a more aggressive look compared to the previous model. The side profile remains pretty similar to before, apart from a set of new alloy wheel designs. Around the back, the Model 3 comes with updated taillights and a new bumper. The car is also available in a couple of new, exclusive paint colours! \n\nOn the inside, the look and feel are still pretty similar to before, but there are a couple of notable differences. While the large landscape infotainment screen remains, the dash around it has been updated, with new LED lights added to it. There a better quality materials to be found throughout the cabin compared to before, and the infotainment system has been updated and is much quicker and more responsive than before. The indicator buttons have now also been integrated into the steering wheel. \n\nWhen it comes to performance, the Model 3 still comes with a single-motor RWD edition and a dual-motor long-range edition. However, aerodynamic improvements and overall performance updates mean the car can now travel further, with the single-motor RWD having a range of 346 miles, while the dual-motor can travel for up to 423 miles! \n\nThe new Model 3 won’t be released in the UK until next year, but thankfully, the price is set to stay pretty similar to before - so you can expect entry-level models to cost around £42,000. But will it be worth the wait? You’ll need to stick with Mat and see for yourself!\n\nConfigure a Tesla Model 3 with carwow: https://bit.ly/Configure-A-Model-3\n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n00:27 Design\n01:50 Interior\n02:45 Noise\n03:45 Suspension\n04:21 Infotainment\n05:36 Back Seats\n06:15 Efficiency\n06:47 Range\n07:02 Price & Release\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW","title":"New Tesla Model 3 - what's changed?","duration":481,"channel_id":"UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA","author":"carwow","date":"20230901","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ6zIHHMlSs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gQ6zIHHMlSs/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1350056}}

It was developed in America in the 1970's by George Wright and gets it's name from the Phoenix workshops. It is classified as a downdraft kiln because the flames go up into the ware chamber and then down to the exit flue of the ware chambers before going up a chimney. I built one from mud to learn about how it works and to see how hot it gets. \nThe mud I used for the kiln is white clay from a flood area and it less than ideal for making pottery. \nI tested it and it worked ok but I knocked out the exit flue wall to make it behave more like a cross draft kiln before firing the pots. The kiln worked well in firing pottery despite the poor quality clay which cracked easily. If run for longer it probably would have reached higher temperatures. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #downdraftkiln #kiln","title":"Primitive Technology: Downdraft Kiln","duration":614,"channel_id":"UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA","author":"Primitive Technology","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbc443KVWfI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wbc443KVWfI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":694665}}

{"description":"Tropical Storm Idalia descended on the Carolinas on its way out to the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday, leaving a trail of flooding and destruction throughout the Southeast that stretched back to its landfall as a hurricane in Florida.\n\nRescue and repair efforts continued in the areas the storm passed Wednesday and there was no immediate word on the toll from the ferocious winds and inundating waters, but authorities counted at least one death.\n\nThe storm left as many as a half-million customers without power in Florida and other states at one point as it ripped down power poles and lines. Still, it was far less destructive than feared, providing only glancing blows to Tampa Bay and other more populated areas as it came ashore with 125 mph (201 kph) winds in rural Florida.\n\nThe weakening storm still packed winds of up to 60 mph (96 kph) as it blasted through Georgia and South Carolina on Wednesday evening. It was expected to reach the North Carolina coast Thursday and roll off into the ocean through the weekend.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who declared a statewide emergency earlier this week as Idalia approached, had warned residents in coastal and eastern inland counties to prepare for heavy rainfall and localized flooding and urged them to stay off roads covered by water.\n\nIn South Carolina, the storm coupled with king tides to send seawater flowing over sand dunes and spilling onto beachfront streets. In Charleston, a surge from Idalia topped the seawall that protects the downtown, sending ankle-deep ocean water into the streets and neighborhoods where horse-drawn carriages pass million-dollar homes and the famous open-air market.\n\nPreliminary data showed the Wednesday evening high tide reached just over 9.2 feet (2.8 meters), more than 3 feet (0.9 meters) above normal and the fifth-highest reading in Charleston Harbor since records were first kept in 1899.\n\nBands from Idalia also brought short-lived tornadoes. One flipped a car in suburban Goose Creek, South Carolina, causing minor injuries, authorities said. No major damage was reported.\n\nAfter traveling across the Gulf of Mexico, Idalia came ashore Wednesday morning near Keaton Beach, pummeling Florida’s remote and lightly populated Big Bend region with powerful winds.\n\nThe area, where the Florida Panhandle curves into the peninsula, saw streets turned into rivers that submerged cars and homes, while the howling winds tore off roofs, snapped tall trees, sent sheet metal flying and shredded homes.\n\n“All hell broke loose,” said Belond Thomas of Perry, a mill town located just inland from the Big Bend region. Thomas fled with her family and some friends to a motel, thinking it would be safer than riding out the storm at home but the roof was torn away and debris showered onto her pregnant daughter, who fortunately wasn’t injured, Thomas said.\n\nNo hurricane-related deaths were officially confirmed in Florida, but the state's highway patrol reported two people killed in separate weather-related crashes just hours before Idalia made landfall.\n\nEven so, Idalia appeared to be far less destructive than first feared. It avoided large urban regions, striking only glancing blows to Tampa Bay and other more populated areas while focusing its fury on the rural Big Bend section.\n\nHowever, damage there was likely to be extensive.\n\nAt Horseshoe Beach in central Big Bend, Jewell Baggett picked through the wreckage and debris of her mother’s destroyed home, finding a few pictures and her mother’s pots and pans.\n\nHer grandfather built the home decades ago and it had survived four previous storms, she said.\n\n“And now it’s gone,” she said. “Nothing left. A few little trinkets here and there.”\n\nBaggett, whose mother had left before the storm hit, said at least five or six other homes also were destroyed.\n\nIn Tallahassee, the power went out well before the center of the storm arrived, but the city avoided a direct hit. A giant oak tree next to the governor’s mansion split in half, covering the yard with debris.\n\nState officials, 5,500 National Guardsman and rescue crews went into search-and-recovery mode, inspecting bridges, clearing toppled trees and looking for anyone in distress. More than 30,000 utility workers gathered to repair downed power lines and poles.\n\nREAD MORE: https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/tropical-storm-idalia-north-carolina/507-6ab5b730-ea2a-4c37-93e0-48fc677b55ff","title":"Hurricane Idalia devastation seen across social media","duration":149,"channel_id":"UCcT6w3xUyVshyR2_2vrMp1w","author":"WUSA9","date":"20230831","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4NclqJ87QQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4NclqJ87QQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":600073}}

{"description":"OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH is based (very) loosely on the true adventures of 18th century would-be pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby). After trading the seemingly charmed life of a gentleman for one of a swashbuckling buccaneer, Stede became captain of the pirate ship Revenge. Struggling to earn the respect of his potentially mutinous crew, Stede’s fortunes changed after a fateful run-in with the infamous Captain Blackbeard (Taika Waititi). To their surprise, the wildly different Stede and Blackbeard found more than friendship on the high seas…they found love. Now, they have to survive it.\n\nSeason 2 of OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH premieres October 5, only on Max.\n\nAbout Max:\nMax is the culture-defining entertainment service for every mood.

Today I let the intrusive thoughts win and melted together every bar of soap sold at Whole Foods…yes, that’s right - not even Whole Foods is safe from some ~mad franken-science~.\n\nSo we bought 109 bars from 23 different brands - and shredded them all down to tiny little cheese shreds, and then used a \"rebatching\" technique to create one singular & striped franken-bar. The process was long and grueling, but it was definitely worth it in the end since our final franken-bars ended up so cute!! What do you guys think of our final product? And since we've tackled both Lush and Whole Foods soaps now, whose soaps do you want to see us demolish next??? \n\nBig thank you to both Katie at Royalty Soaps & Anne-Marie at Bramble Berry for their expert opinions on our franken-soap!!

But as they unpack the riddle of their mutual past and compare their lives to the dreams they once shared, they begin to wonder if their reunion is mere coincidence, or something more enchanted.\n--\nOfficial Bleecker Street Site: https://bleeckerstreetmedia.com/\nFOLLOW us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bleeckerstfilms/\nLIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BleeckerStFilms\nFOLLOW us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/bleeckerstfilms","title":"WHAT HAPPENS LATER | Official Trailer | Bleecker Street","duration":156,"channel_id":"UCafnP6JPjVq8AahYaThUelg","author":"Bleecker Street","date":"20230830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zceSigCGWSQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zceSigCGWSQ/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":878307}}

Throughout this video we're gonna be going through it all but if you enjoy the video make sure you hit the thumbs up button and subscribe you will for videos like this every day.\n\nWith that out the way, thanks for clicking this, now let's get into Ahsoka.\n\n-\n\nSo last week saw a Super Star Destroyer Hypedrive been brought to the eye of Sion in order to give Morgan Elsbeth a pathway to Thrawn. Based on the Jedi hyperdrive rings this would allow the nightsister to finally bring him back after he was taken away in the rebels finales.\n\nThough last week we thought Sion might be a reference to Darth Sion it's true meaning is probbaly more inline with the literary meaning which defines a mystical utopia. The word also shares similarities to the word Scion which means heir. Thraw was known as the heir to the empire showing that it's all connected.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"AHSOKA Episode 3 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Rebels Easter Eggs, Theories & Review","duration":1403,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdtH_F9InJw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdtH_F9InJw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":262292}}

Streetwise but down-on-his-luck, Clarence (LaKeith Stanfield) is struggling to find a better life for his family, while fighting to free himself of debt. Captivated by the power and glory of the rising Messiah and His apostles, he risks everything to carve his own path to a divine life, and ultimately discovers that the redemptive power of belief may be his only way out.

I'm now about 60 hours in Starfield on PC, and after completing the main questline and several factions, I've realized there is still a massive amount of content to tackle.  Starfield hits differently for me than Skyrim - not better or worse...just different.  It takes time to settle in and grow on you.  Quests, writing and game performance all stand out as well done.

You will join Constellation – the last group of space explorers seeking rare artifacts throughout the galaxy – and navigate the vast expanse of space in Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest and most ambitious game.\nTell Your story\nIn Starfield the most important story is the one you tell with your character. Start your journey by customizing your appearance and deciding your Background and Traits. Will you be an experienced explorer, a charming diplomat, a stealthy cyber runner, or something else entirely? The choice is yours. Decide who you will be and what you will become.\nExplore Outer Space\nVenture through the stars and explore more than 1000 planets. Navigate bustling cities, explore dangerous bases, and traverse wild landscapes. Meet and recruit a memorable cast of characters, join in the adventures of various factions, and embark on quests across the Settled Systems. A new story or experience is always waiting to be discovered.\nCaptain the Ship Of Your Dreams\nPilot and command the ship of your dreams. Personalize the look of your ship, modify critical systems including weapons and shields, and assign crew members to provide unique bonuses. In deep space you will engage in high-stakes dogfights, encounter random missions, dock at star stations, and even board and commandeer enemy ships to add to your collection.\nDiscover, Collect, Build\nExplore planets and discover the fauna, flora, and resources needed to craft everything from medicine and food to equipment and weapons. Build outposts and hire a crew to passively extract materials and establish cargo links to transfer resources between them.

We made a music video and uploaded it on my music channel, but I recorded other footage, and wanted to make a video that represents just the Minecraft side of things, and that was extra meaningful to my fans in particular.\n\nThis video is meant to represent what Techno & I were doing when we were invited by Mr Beast to duel for $100,000, and then a recreation of the duel itself. This was one of the most notable moments of my life. This is meant to help us remember Technoblade,  keep his legacy living on, while also contributing to charity.\n\nTechnodad helped make sure the duel captured the sportsmanship the original duel did. The rest was thought up and organized by me and friends, on our own budget to raise money for charity.\n\nI debated putting this on a different channel, but it felt at home here.
