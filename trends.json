Struggling to earn the respect of his potentially mutinous crew, Stede’s fortunes changed after a fateful run-in with the infamous Captain Blackbeard (Taika Waititi). To their surprise, the wildly different Stede and Blackbeard found more than friendship on the high seas…they found love. Now, they have to survive it.\n\nSeason 2 of OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH premieres October 5, only on Max.\n\nAbout Max:\nMax is the culture-defining entertainment service for every mood.

Throughout this video we're gonna be going through it all but if you enjoy the video make sure you hit the thumbs up button and subscribe you will for videos like this every day.\n\nWith that out the way, thanks for clicking this, now let's get into Ahsoka.\n\n-\n\nSo last week saw a Super Star Destroyer Hypedrive been brought to the eye of Sion in order to give Morgan Elsbeth a pathway to Thrawn. Based on the Jedi hyperdrive rings this would allow the nightsister to finally bring him back after he was taken away in the rebels finales.\n\nThough last week we thought Sion might be a reference to Darth Sion it's true meaning is probbaly more inline with the literary meaning which defines a mystical utopia. The word also shares similarities to the word Scion which means heir. Thraw was known as the heir to the empire showing that it's all connected.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"AHSOKA Episode 3 Breakdown | Ending Explained, Star Wars Rebels Easter Eggs, Theories & Review","duration":1403,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230830","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdtH_F9InJw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdtH_F9InJw/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":235695}}

{"description":"The Duel...\n\nAll money from this video goes to charity.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO TECHNOBLADE.\n\nEret: @TheEret \nSquidkid: @imasquidkid \nMrBeast: @MrBeast \n\nFor a song I made that was inspired by technoblade. We made a music video and uploaded it on my music channel, but I recorded other footage, and wanted to make a video that represents just the Minecraft side of things, and that was extra meaningful to my fans in particular.\n\nThis video is meant to represent what Techno & I were doing when we were invited by Mr Beast to duel for $100,000, and then a recreation of the duel itself. This was one of the most notable moments of my life. This is meant to help us remember Technoblade,  keep his legacy living on, while also contributing to charity.\n\nTechnodad helped make sure the duel captured the sportsmanship the original duel did. The rest was thought up and organized by me and friends, on our own budget to raise money for charity.\n\nI debated putting this on a different channel, but it felt at home here.
