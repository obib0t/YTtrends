{"description":"Undefeated three-division champion Terence ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Crawford emphatically stamped his place in the history books with a ninth-round TKO over the previously unbeaten Errol ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù Spence Jr. to become the first undisputed welterweight champion of the four-belt era in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions.\n \n‚ÄúIt means everything because of who I took the belts from,‚Äù said Crawford. ‚ÄúThey talked bad about me. They said I wasn‚Äôt good enough and I couldn‚Äôt beat these welterweights. I just kept my head to the sky and kept praying to God that I would get the opportunity to show the world how great Terence Crawford is. Tonight, I believe I showed how great I am.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúHe was just better tonight,‚Äù said Spence. ‚ÄúHe was using the jab. My timing was a little bit off. He was just the better man tonight.‚Äù\n \nIn addition to adding the WBC, WBA and IBF titles to his WBO belt, Crawford became the first male fighter to become an undisputed champion in two weight classes, having previously won all four belts at 140-pounds. In a fight where Spence had already been down three times, Crawford‚Äôs ninth round onslaught of hooks forced referee Harvey Dock to wave off the action 2:32 in the frame.\n \nAfter years of build-up, Spence came out aggressively in the opening round, jabbing and attacking Crawford‚Äôs body. Crawford, who is known for fighting from both the southpaw and orthodox stances, fought primarily as a southpaw and scored his first knockdown in round two with a powerful right cross that caught Spence off balance and sent him down for the first time in his career.\n \n‚ÄúWe practice that,‚Äù said Crawford. ‚ÄúNormally in camp we do a flick and jab. But we knew that wasn‚Äôt going to work with Errol Spence because he‚Äôs durable, he‚Äôs strong. So we had to practice a strong firm jab. The jab hit him and stopped him in his tracks.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúHe was just throwing the hard jab,‚Äù said Spence. ‚ÄúHe was timing with his jab. His timing was just on point. I wasn‚Äôt surprised by his speed or his accuracy. It was everything I thought.‚Äù\n \nSpence came out in round three determined to turn the tide after the knockdown, throwing big shots, including a left hook that landed cleanly early. However, Crawford was able to withstand the attack and showed his precision by landing a clean counter right that again staggered Spence.\n \n‚ÄúErrol Spence is a tremendous talent and he‚Äôs got a great jab,‚Äù said Crawford. ‚ÄúWe were worried about the jab coming in because that‚Äôs how he sets up all of his shots.  Our main focus was the jab. You take away his best attribute. The rest is history.‚Äù\n \nIn round seven, Crawford dropped Spence twice, once with a clean right uppercut early on and again late in the round with a right hook. Crawford led 79-70 on all three cards at the time of the stoppage and dominated the CompuBox stats with an 185 to 96 advantage in punches landed and an astounding 50% connect rate.\n \nPost-fight, Crawford showed his respect for Spence stepping up to the plate and making the super fight happen and spoke to the historic nature of the matchup, while Spence expressed his interest in a rematch later this year.\n \n‚ÄúWe gotta do it again,‚Äù said Spence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a lot better. It‚Äôll be a lot closer. It‚Äôll probably be in December and the end of the year. I say we gotta do it again.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúLike I said before, I only dreamed of being a world champion,‚Äù said Crawford. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an overachiever. Nobody believed in me when I was coming up, but I made everybody a believer. I want to thank Spence and his team because without him none of this would have been possible.‚Äù\n\n#TerenceCrawford #ErrolSpenceJr #SpenceCrawford\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","title":"Spence vs Crawford HIGHLIGHTS: JULY 29, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV","duration":100,"channel_id":"UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw","author":"Premier Boxing Champions","date":"20230730","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zPaYp8XN9Y","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_zPaYp8XN9Y/hqdefault.webp?v=64c5fc03","content":{"View count":3326078}}

teteros\nPorque en este g√©nero tengo m√°s hijos que el lechero\nCuando se meten con el mero mero\nSaco el bombardero y acelero\nY su nivel rebaja sin que tomen coca cola cero\nHago un agujero y entro cuando quiero\nPor debajo del portero\nEste caballero pateando como delantero\nLes parte el trasero \nSoy el lobo que revuelca el gallinero\nNi con balas de plata muero siempre nuevo\ncomo el primero de enero.\nLo m√≠o nunca caduca\nYa yo no tiro punchlines\nYo disparo con bazooka\nMis barras botas mas humo que un sal√≥n de hookas\nCon media yuca les parto la nuca\nY como a Farruko se les vuela la peluca\nDesde mi ni√±ez tengo lucidez\nNo creo en el 2, no creo en el 3\nCreo en el 1 y el 0, es\npor eso soy el 10.\nYo los muerdo,\nno pueden conmigo estos cerdos\nNi peleando solo con el ojo izquierdo\nNi aunque Drake apueste a favor m√≠o pierdo.\nMe com√≠ todos los entremeses\nEn esta pecera ya no veo peses \nSin que me interese\nComo cuando hablo y me como las eses\nMe dicen Cesar Millan a veces\nPorque cuando el Residente habla\nEstos perros obedecen\nSoy imparable ni aunque recen \nMil veces todos los meses\nSoy como Messi clav√°ndose a los franceses\nPorque desde Calle 13\nEl rap y yo vivimos juntos como los siameses\nMi letra es precisa cuando va de prisa\nSoy como una brisa que los descuartiza\nCon el filo de mi tiza\nComo las navajas de suiza\nNi aunque me tiren encima las playas de Ibiza\nEste volc√°n se paraliza\nLos hago cenizas\nChito Vera d√°ndole una paliza\nPero les juro que me cansa darles duro\nLo se, soy un inmaduro\nPa divertirme los torturo\nLes desfigur√≥ los d√≠as del sol\nPara que su futuro sea oscuro\nYa no quiero hacer m√°s tiraeras\nQuiero pasear mi perrito por la acera\nTener sexo grupal hasta que muera\nHacer manualidades pa vender en la primavera\nRegar las plantas del jard√≠n con la manguera\nAbogar por la paz mundial en la tierra\nCada vez que haya guerra\nSiempre por el centro nunca a la extrema\nSin asumir posturas de ning√∫n tema\nPorque no quiero problemas.\nCaerle bien a to el mundo como un pastel de crema\nQuiero ser humanista\nQuiero dejar de acribillar artistas\nY que las cabezas ya no rueden por la pista\nPronunciar las ‚Äúeses‚Äù en todas las entrevistas\nDesde hoy, quiero ser baladista.\n\nSoy el amor que te ama, AM√ÅNDOTE.\nQuiero querer, quererte, QUERI√âNDOTE.\nY si yo estoy aqu√≠ y tu est√°s all√°,\nquiero

chiquito admito que cuando me agito y recito\npor el beat hasta el infinito ya no veo letras en mi manuscrito,\nahora solo veo numeritos.\nSoy calculador como asesino en serie\ncuando decapito cada cabeza de cada raperito\nla cuantifico.\nEstoy enfermo porque mientras m√°s les doy me excito.\nHasta el planeta Tierra me pide a los gritos: ‚Äú¬°NOOOO\nMEJOR QUE CAIGA UN METEORITO!‚Äù\nDicen que estoy maldito porque sin varita m√°gica y sin sombrerito\nyo los convierto en pajaritos.\nSolo recito mis escritos y vuelan pal carajo\ncomo los celulares que tira Benito.\nViven menos que un mosquito,\nsus pel√≠culas no duran porque yo se las edito.\nMe dicen Almodovar sin tener un gui√≥n escrito\nporque yo no vivo para el Rap, el Rap vive en la piel que habito.\nPerdonan que presuma pero saben que el Residente\nes peligroso con la pluma, cinta negra con la tinta\ncolor puma, como Snoop Dog se los fuma.\n¬°Ni pidiendo por la paz mundial, los salva Maluma!\nEstoy entre la bruma jangueando con Moctezuma,\nno me llegan aunque sean contables no les da la suma.\nEstoy tirando tanta peste, que ni con un ba√±o de espuma\nesta pista se perfuma.\nVoy de cacer√≠a con mi artiller√≠a\nmontada en las caballer√≠as de letras en coreograf√≠a\ncon una maestr√≠a en poes√≠a con ingenier√≠a.\nMe ven las arp√≠as pasar con mi palabrer√≠a y\n‚ÄúShhhh..se quedan en silencio como
