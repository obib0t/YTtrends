After over two years of lockdowns and quarantines, people eagerly restarted their lives, but there were certainly growing pains. Weddings and travel skyrocketed, but so did lost luggage and global inflation rates. Taylor Swift broke Ticketmaster. Cryptocurrency was headed toward a great year until it really, really wasn‚Äôt. 2022 tested the world population as we tested out life in a new phase of the pandemic.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine, and aid relief flooded into the war-torn country. Refugees were welcomed into surrounding countries, and those who stayed behind inspired people around the world. Global protests cried out for justice in Iran. Football teams stood up for migrant workers and the LGBTQ+ community at the World Cup. Cuba legalized same-sex marriage. The world froze for a moment when England‚Äôs longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, died. And we all watched a lot of TikTok. \n\nAs we head into 2023, take a moment to look back at the events that defined this year.\n\nFor more on 2022 from Vox.com:\n\nAlissa Wilkinson‚Äôs The 25 best movies of 2022: https://www.vox.com/culture/23484805/best-movies-2022-streaming-theaters\n\nConstance Grady‚Äôs Vox‚Äôs 16 best books of 2022: https://www.vox.com/culture/23500142/best-books-2022-if-i-survive-you-vladimir-furrows-lessons-either-or-ducks-joan-is-okay-shy-hotbed\n\nMarin Cogan‚Äôs Antisemitism isn‚Äôt new.

{"description":"The 2022 Ford GT (US $660,845 when purchased) is so much more than a pretty face designed in a wind tunnel. It has a twin turbo V6 with 660 horsepower, lots of weight saving carbon fibre, and a rapidly-deploying suspension drop system along with an active rear wing that is as functional as it is dramatic. But how does it stack up against a 2023 Corvette C8 Z06 ($164,505 as specced in the US, $189,027 in Canada) which is but a fraction of the cost and has a high-revving naturally aspirated V8? Thomas and James put these two marvels of American engineering to the test. We hope you enjoy the episode! Thanks for watching.

Every $1 counts so thank you for clicking the donate button on this screen to help Make-A-Wish Foundation grant the wishes of these kids.\n\nI just had one of the eight spinal tumors removed from my back, so I can't do a whole lot while I recover from surgery. But, with the help of my wife, Vy Qwaint, I think we can build a pretty awesome indoor family entertainment center for everybody to enjoy. Inside the adventure park we plan on having a trampoline park, video game arcade, zip line, ropes course, ninja warrior training courses, escape rooms, axe throwing, free roam Virtual Reality VR, retro barcade, climbing walls, restaurant, birthday party rooms, and a ton more fun stuff to do here in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nWe're gonna need a lot more help to get this FEC built by my birthday on March 10th so we need to hire some help. Vy interviews Burt and attempts to interview a guy name James but it doesn't go so well. The last candidate, Anne, we brought over to interview from bed.

You can tell he worked on the video because the animation was good lol. I'm working on building a team to be able to make more videos and Matt has been a huge help in that effort. I'm still learning how to build a team at all so there may be some growing pains but it's exciting that it's happening.\n\nAnyway this video is about an experience I had last summer. My friend invited me to go farm sit and that was a great and rare opportunity just plopped on my lap so I decided I really wanted to go. And so I did! There was a lot of new experiences gained from the trip, and in this video was the most notable ones. Italy is a beautiful place with really tasty food. I am certainly going back some day. Either as a farmer or a tourist who knows.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this video.

{"description":"I‚Äôve just disembarked what may be the shortest and weirdest cruise in history on a ship that was planned to be scrapped in 2020. She was saved from the scrapyard by a new British cruise line and I booked a 3 night mini break onboard the ship. \n \nOur cruise was cancelled 4 hours after we boarded and in total we were onboard this ship for about 8 hours, and during that time we had more problems than we would usually on a full two week cruise. The way that everything was handled was so bizarre I honestly think I‚Äôm still in shock. \n \nWe boarded the ship in London Tilbury and were planning on heading to Bruges to the Christmas markets. Embarkation was pretty easy and despite the bad weather we were really excited to get onboard. \n \nI picked up my cruise card which is the thing you use to get into your room, to buy drinks, pretty much everything onboard it‚Äôs very important. But my friends Justin and Tristan were told that they‚Äôd have to get theirs onboard as they weren‚Äôt ready yet, no big deal we thought, that isn‚Äôt uncommon on a cruise for things to be a bit delayed. The problem was much bigger than that but at this point we didn‚Äôt realise how widespread the problem was. \n \nAs soon as we embarked the ship we were in the middle of this beautiful Atrum, the ship was decorated for Christmas and looked amazing. Despite the ship being from 1991 everything here looked very new and I hoped that the rest of the ship would be as nice as this area. I didn‚Äôt have particularly high expectations after reading review after review online about broken toilets, broken air conditioning but this area definitely surpassed what I had expected. \n\nCruise Buoys Vlog: https://youtu.be/k8gPqPTbFgw\nSail Away With Dan and Jay Tour: https://youtu.be/XBCVVW75SGk\n \nOne of my favourite things about cruising is that feeling when you first get onboard a cruise ship and you run around exploring as fast as you can. Looking back I‚Äôm so glad that I did because I wouldn‚Äôt have a chance to later. We found a big pub area called The Purple Turtle which I‚Äôve since found out used to be a casino. In the UK we don‚Äôt gamble as much as other places so if a British cruise line buys an American or Australian ship, they normally replace the big casino with one thats much smaller. \n \nThe ship was originally launched in 1991 for Princess cruises as Regal Princess and spent most of her life as Pacific Dawn for P&O Australia. As I was wandering around the main public areas I thought wow Ambassador have done a great job renovating these spaces, I‚Äôve since had a look at P&O Dawn ship reviews and I think I should be giving a lot of the credit to P&O instead of Ambassador because most of the inside spaces haven‚Äôt changed, even the picture frames are the same in the big lounges. Not that that‚Äôs a bad thing, they didn‚Äôt need to be changed, P&O did a great job with these areas when they refit the ship back in 2017. \n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to exclusive perks like a weekly podcast and early ad free access to videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu4C8c3h9SKdkxnOwIAiHeA/join\n\n‚ñ∂ Weekly Updates: http://EmmaCruises.com/News\n‚ñ∂ Book a Cruise: https://EmmaCruises.com/Book-a-Cruise/\n\nLet‚Äôs Connect! \n‚ñ∂ https://EmmaCruises.com/SocialLinks\n\n*** \n‚ñ∂  Background World Map: https://emmacruises.com/map (Affiliate link)\n\nemma@emmacruises.com","title":"Our Cruise Was CANCELLED After 4 Hours Onboard","duration":779,"channel_id":"UCu4C8c3h9SKdkxnOwIAiHeA","author":"Emma Cruises","date":"20221220","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jppzHpO_8xU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jppzHpO_8xU/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1177663}}

{"description":"Sponsor: Fractal Pop Air RGB Case on Amazon https://geni.us/TMxbP\nThe NVIDIA RTX 4080 has a problem: No one is buying it -- or at least, not enough people that board partners are feeling relief from their investment. They're on the hook for millions upon millions of dollars in inventory, and it's because NVIDIA's pricing structure is so egregiously bad that sales have finally slowed. NVIDIA got comfortable with a market where literally anything would sell, no exaggeration, and just existing would guarantee a sale. But that market is over, and now NVIDIA has an RTX 4080 problem.
