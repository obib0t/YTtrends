After the game Tatum said he was only a quote, “shell of myself.” Jimmy Butler earned Eastern Conference Finals MVP award and Heat now matchup with the Denver Nuggets in the NBA Finals.

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to the final installment of our Nordic/Scandinavian trip - the Glass Igloos in Finland! So far on our trip, we have taken a communal hot bath at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland, nearly cryogenically frozen ourselves at the ICEHOTEL in Sweden, and now we're on to Arctic Finland to stay in a glass igloo under the northern lights!\n\nFor years, I've been seeing the glass igloos in Finland on my instagram, tiktok - **and YouTube shorts** feeds - and I've always wanted to try them out. I've never seen the northern lights before, and I've also never stayed in a human-sized terrarium before, but I've always been intrigued by those see-through bubble tents - so we decided to go and try one out and see if we freeze our butts off! And while at Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort, home of the glass igloos, we also tried a bunch of arctic activities - like snowmobiling, reindeer sleigh rides, dog sledding, and traditional Finnish sauna-ing and ice bathing!! \n\nWhat do you think??

{"description":"You’ll be amazed at what you can do with GrammarlyGO. Sign up at https://grammarly.com/heatcheck05 and get 20% off Grammarly Premium.\n\nDo you remember this shot?\nWell the Celtics did the same thing but with the stakes being much higher.\nBoston comes back from 0-3 and secures a game 7 in the most insane way possible. And the final 2 minutes deserve a breakdown.\nDown by 7 at the end, Miami is fighting desperately here. But it was almost game over as Horford has the ball but gets it poked. And follow Jimmy here as he’s going to slip this screen for Robinson causing a split second hesitation by Smart enough for him to have enough space to fire away this shot and bring it within 4.\nButler was just 3 for 19 up to this point, but when it matters the most he delivers.\n4 point game and Miami defends in a zone here. The Celtics find Horford in the middle and the great cut by Tatum to get the ball, but even better read by Bam to help on the drive, a great contest and the Heat have a real chance here with a 1:40 left. In transition you know who has the ball at the end of the game. And with Adebayo screening for Duncan, Horford has to be there with him so Jimmy sees that the paint is open so he barrels inside and gets 2 free throws, now this is where the real madness begins.\nButler hits the first to make it a 3 point game but misses the second however watch Martin as he’s going to reposition while the ball is sitting on the rim and actually ends up with the rebound.\nHe finds none other than the best shooter on the floor all alone for this shot and misses it. He was on fire the entire game. How did he miss this look? Had all the time in the world right here. The drama continues.\nTatum wants the ball here and he’s going to set a screen to get a switch. Butler defends for the drive but Robinson fights over the screen and stays with White. You see that Tatum is open right here and the pass goes to him, Bam tries to contest but this is an open look. And at the same time watch Brown here who’s got an uncontested rebound. And on the miss he gets the ball and misses it but gets the foul call. \nJaylen makes the first but misses the second allowing a transition opportunity for Miami. And again watch how dangerous Robinson is as he’s going to set a ghost screen fooling Smart and clearing the way for Jimmy to attack right at the basket and not only that but get a bucket and the foul. Unbelievable. It’s only a 1 point game with 50 seconds to go. And things are about to escalate here.\nThe Heat staying in the zone and Tatum has the ball again, blows past Butler but Vincent follows that and steps in right here completely disrupting the drive and it’s a loose ball but JT recovers goes up for the shot but gets it blocked by Adebayo.\nA real flashback from that iconic block from the bubble. But let’s get back to the present day as that defensive stop opens up another transition opportunity and you see that the Celtics are scrambling with 2 guys pointing towards Robinson but nobody near him. \nHe has another wide open look for the lead and misses again. Absolutely unreal. This would have given Miami a 2 point advantage in the closing seconds. Now they had to foul but got a bit lucky because Smart misses 1 free throw. And in a do or die situation Spoelstra asks Jimmy if he wants to go without a timeout and he confirms. A gutsy decision by a great coach.\nBack to the video for the crucial possession. You know who’s gonna take the last shot. And Tatum is on him. Bam goes to screen and is able to force a switch putting a slower Horford in front. But with 5 seconds remaining Jimmy is almost at the logo. Duncan clears the side and Butler goes to the corner for a desperation shot and gets fouled! He gets fouled and on the review we see that his feet are behind the line so it’s 3 shots for the win.\nHe’s an 80% shooter from the line this postseason and with the NBA finals on the line, calmly knocks all three shots one by one.\nWhich brings us to the ultimate chaos at the end. You see that Struss is guarding White on the inbounds but he’s faced the other way and traps Tatum here as Miami didn’t want him to take the shot. So the pass goes to Smart and as the shot goes up, White has the presence of mind to go inside for the rebound and Struss is trying to recover back to him but he’s trailing.\nSo on the miss Derrick puts it back in but the buzzer sounds at the same time, so everyone is confused. Complete madness and disbelief in the arena as the refs are checking this frame by frame and we see that White was able to get it off with 1 tenth of a second remaining to force a game 7 and save his team from the brink of elimination in the craziest way possible.\nThis instantly reminded me of the legendary Ray Allen shot that completely demoralized San Antonio in game 6 who were just moments from winning the championship. And we’ve heard the stories of how that postgame dinner looked like a funeral for the Spurs.\nWell this was the same thing in my opinion.","title":"THIS Will HAUNT Miami...The Mistake That Cost Them The Finals","duration":517,"channel_id":"UCmwxBk7Af9OnnloGZzp6JnQ","author":"Heat Check","date":"20230528","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmzsKp-iCcc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JmzsKp-iCcc/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":283997}}

{"description":"Today’s In a Nutshell will be on Roblox King Legacy, a Roblox RPG game based on the anime One Piece. The game is very similar to Blox Fruits and is the second most popular One Piece game on Roblox. So what that means is yeah... most of this video is going to be a shetpost. \n\nKing Legacy is a generic Roblox roleplaying game (RPG) where players complete quests, level up and get more powerful gears. Currently, there is the First and Second Sea. NPCs in the Second Sea are stronger, and the player needs to be at least level 2250 to enter. The levelling is almost the same as Blox Fruits, where each island has a few NPC giving out quests, and completing them will level you up. The current max level is 4000, so you can go from noob to pro in a day or two if you are dedicated. Using codes will help you level faster. \n\nThere are 3 types of attacks for combat: fruit, melee and sword. Each type of attack has different abilities, and their damage depends on your stats. \n\nFruits are obtained by scavenging, rolling from gacha or buying from the black market. Fruits spawn every 1 or 2 hours and you can roll for them 5 times every 6 hours. The black market restocks every hour but fruits there are randomized. There is no definite tier list of which fruit is the best. The best fruit depends on your combo and how it synergizes with other abilities. Certain fruits are good for grinding, while others are good for PvP. The good fruits are Dragon, Dough, Light, Magma, Gravity, Dark and Venom. \n\nFor melee, there are currently 5 fighting styles: Black Leg, Cyborg, Real Water Style (Fishman Karate), Dragon Claw and Electro. All except Fishman Karate can be upgraded to V2 for more damage and cooler effects. \n\nSwords have 2 abilities, and they are obtained by killing bosses or by purchasing. Sword can be upgraded at the blacksmith. The normal upgrade gives more damage, and the enchantment gives special effects. \n\nLike Blox Fruits, there are special abilities like Busoshoku Haki, Kenbunshoku Haki, Soru,  Geppo and Haoshoku Haki (Conqueror's haki). Buso Haki makes you black and deals more damage on non-fruit attacks. Ken Haki gives ESP and auto-dodge. Soru lets you teleport a short distance, Geppo lets you jump in the air, and Conqueror’s Haki stuns lower-level people around you.\n\nSo yeah, just like all the other Roblox In A Nutshell videos, I will attempt to show everything Roblox King Legacy has to offer: abilities, fruits, fighting styles, swords, guns, races, accessories, stats, combat, and grinding. Some people speculate that guns will be added in the next update and that would be hilarious cuz it would just be like Blox Fruits.  And like always, this Roblox video is filled with a crapload of dumb jokes and dead memes and takes the form of a funny moments/funny montage/edit.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.","title":"Roblox B̶̷̶l̶̷̶o̶̷̶x̶̷̶ ̶̷̶F̶̷̶r̶̷̶u̶̷̶i̶̷̶t̶̷̶s̶̷̶ King Legacy In A Nutshell V3","duration":857,"channel_id":"UCH6sNLmH-rsATLffdpGYscQ","author":"Tank Fish","date":"20230527","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoPzGJ9RGpY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/JoPzGJ9RGpY/hqdefault.webp?v=647122be","content":{"View count":614095}}

{"description":"As was reported might be the case, it turns out that the first day after chemo is pretty OK, but then it gets progressively worse until day 5 or 6. I'm now on day 7 and feeling OK. I've had many (but not all!) of the expected side effects, but my appetite has been good, which is very good for the quality of life! Glad to be through the worst of the first treatment, but obviously I've still got a long way to go. I wouldn't want everyone to think that Day 7 is indicative of how you feel while you're doing chemo...if you had seen me on Day 3 I would have been 100% horizontal. \n\nI hear it tends to get a little worse every time (though I've got some tips for how to maybe make a few things hit a little less hard!) Really glad I was feeling good enough to make this video! It was nice to do something normal.\n\nThanks y'all.\n\nHank\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com","title":"My Cancer Press Tier List","duration":326,"channel_id":"UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA","author":"vlogbrothers","date":"20230526","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO80u6G_zQM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UO80u6G_zQM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1459253}}

Hollywood paints it as a time of gunslingers, adventure, and cowboy heroes, but as often is the case, the reality is a bit more lackluster. While it was a rather violent place with high murder rates, this can be misleading as even one murder in a small population size can produce seemingly astronomical murder rates, essentially enhancing outliers in data. The truth is, the \"Wild West\" was a rather calm and boring time where people were much more focused on getting to the next day than robbing trains or saving damsels in distress. But while the dangers painted by Hollywood and dime novels are often over exaggerated and glamorized, that doesn't mean the region and time period was void of danger! So join me back in time to learn about the real history and dangers of the American Wild West!\n\nTitle: Brett Van Donsel – Rattlesnake Railroad\nArtist: Brett Van Donsel\nSource: http://soundcloud.com/brett-van-donse...\nLicense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWild West by ZitronSound http://bit.ly/2nXGy9W\nCreative Commons — CC BY-ND 3.0 https://goo.gl/QHshNa","title":"How to Survive the Wild West","duration":1410,"channel_id":"UCvQ4C0f9_OWRf1uyobwqOwA","author":"BlueJay","date":"20230526","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLWZBXBOBs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxLWZBXBOBs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":510437}}

{"description":"Are YOU ready? THE FLASH - Only in Theaters June 16. #TheFlashMovie\n\nText 239-932-7332 to join the DC Community.\n https://my.community.com/dc\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe?\n\n“The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).\n\n“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023.","title":"THE FLASH - FINAL TRAILER","duration":141,"channel_id":"UCiifkYAs_bq1pt_zbNAzYGg","author":"DC","date":"20230524","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jprhe-cWKGs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jprhe-cWKGs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":12795572}}
