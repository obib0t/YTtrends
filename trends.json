Renowned since their inception for electrifying performances, The Rose quickly became one of Korea's most sought-after groups delivering a series of critically acclaimed albums that resonated with fans worldwide. In 2019, three of the band members temporarily went on hiatus to fulfill their mandatory military service obligations, during which WOOSUNG pursued a successful solo career, releasing captivating albums and embarking on sold-out world tours.\n\nIn a moment of sheer joy for their devoted fans, The Rose reunited during one of Woosung's performances in South Korea in 2022. This reunion paved the way for their first full-length album HEAL, which was inspired by the transformative power of music and the stories shared by both their fans and themselves. HEAL soared to #4 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, while their accompanying HEAL Together World Tour drew an overwhelming crowd of over 90,000 attendees.\n\nNow, with their highly anticipated second full-length album DUAL, The Rose takes their music to new heights. Building upon the emotional honesty and vulnerability showcased in HEAL, this latest offering explores the profound concept of 'balance.' Seamlessly merging light and dark elements, The Rose masterfully weaves emotions and sounds, capturing the dualistic essence that defines their music. \n\nDriven by unwavering dedication to their fans and the unbreakable bond of their friendship, The Rose continues to push artistic boundaries, captivating audiences worldwide with their soul-stirring music and unforgettable performances.\n\n더 로즈(The Rose)는 대한민국 인디 록 밴드이다. 보컬과 기타의 김우성(Woosung), 보컬 및 여러 악기를 다루는 박도준(Dojoon), 베이스의 이재형(Jaehyeong), 그리고 드럼의 이하준(Hajoon)으로 이루어진 이들은 2017년 데뷔, 화려한 라이브 실력으로 전세계 팬들에게 수많은 찬사를 받으며 대한민국에서 가장 인기 있는 밴드 중 하나로 떠올랐다. 2019년에 김우성은 솔로 앨범을 발매하고 성공적인 활동을 펼치며 솔로 월드 투어를 성황리에 마쳤다.\n\n2022년, 더 로즈는 3년 간의 공백기를 끝으로 첫 정규 앨범 ‘HEAL’로 컴백했다. 팬들과 함께 만들었던 이야기들과 음악의 힘에서 영감을 받아 제작된 'HEAL'은 빌보드의 히트시커스 차트에서 4위를 기록하였고, 'HEAL Together World Tour’는 9만 명이 넘는 관객들과 함께했다.\n\n이어서 두 번째 정규 앨범 'DUAL'로 돌아온 더 로즈는 한층 더 성장된 더 로즈의 음악적 스펙트럼을 보여준다.

{"description":"Step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Interstellar!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g\n\nChristopher Nolan has made a name for himself making intellectual mind-bendy movies with films like Memento, Inception and Tenet. Let’s just say it, the dude is a little obsessed with time. He’s one of the few filmmakers making truly “epic” movies, and it’s really cool when you can understand them.\n\nInterstellar definitely raises some questions though. Like why doesn’t anyone seem to care about Tom? Why did they decide to go down to that time dilation planet first? Why did they try to collect that worthless data? Why was there a Matt Damon jumpscare on the second planet? Why did Tom name his kid Coop Cooper? Why did Cooper send the same “stay” message that he knew did not get him to stay?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Interstellar!\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N5nQPNCNkg\n\nThe Flash Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzlSBBVpbS4\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PitchMeeting\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/","title":"Interstellar Pitch Meeting","duration":366,"channel_id":"UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g","author":"Pitch Meeting","date":"20230720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhHjhdwD8gk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/xhHjhdwD8gk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":776621}}

Konrad Laimer was handed his debut in midfield alongside captain Joshua Kimmich. The front four consisted of Leroy Sane, Jamal Musiala, Mathys Tel and Serge Gnabry.

How did the US go from having luxurious, widely used passenger trains to the Amtrak system we have today? \n\nVideo producer Dean Peterson makes a 72-hour journey on Amtrak from LA to NYC to show its current state of operation. From getting kicked in the head by his sleeping seat mate to taking in sweeping views of the desert at sunset, Dean shows the highs and lows of being stuck on Amtrak for days on end. \n\nAlong the way, he explains the history of passenger rail in the US — starting in the problematic robber baron era to the US government’s takeover of passenger rail. Will the United States ever catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to train travel, or are Americans stuck with an underfunded, inefficient rail network forever? Join Dean on his journey as he sets out to find out the answer to these questions and more.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Great Railroad Revolution by Christian Wolmar\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Great-Railroad-Revolution-History-America/dp/1610393473\n\nAmtrak, America's Railroad: Transportation's Orphan and Its Struggle for Survival (Railroads Past and Present) by  Geoffrey H.

{"description":"Mike, Jay, and Rich Evans have returned again to the black void. Their reason today? To talk about a new huge summer blockbuster movie? No. Quite the opposite. They was gonna talk about Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 2: Dead Reckoning 1, BUT they thought… how many times can one see Tom Cruise do stints? No, this day Mike, Jay, and Rich have returned to the black void to talk about “Watchbait” the movie version of “Clickbait”. Trash that has overrun a once great institution like Tubi. And before you ask, no we wasn’t compensated by Tubi to promote these films. We were just browsing about and saw a trend. A trend of using certain words or phrases in a title to get one to click on their junk film to watch it, only to realize after a few minutes they made the worst mistake of their lives. This particular video wasn’t a Half in the Bag. Nor was it a re:View. Nor was it a Best of the Worst. I guess it could have been a “Talks About” video, but nah. We made a new show called “Beyond the Black Void” and if you ever see one of these again, it’s just Mike, Jay and Rich Evens talking about something of interest. In solidarity with the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strike we decided to talk about movies that in no way whatsoever could have possibly been made under any conceivable union agreement. In fact, I’d be shocked if one of these pictures weren’t some kind of nudie snuff film. Maybe that’s why Jay “downloaded all of them on his dark web server” whatever that means. And yes, it’s 100% true, we did just spring this whole thing on Rich Evans. I rang him up on my landline to tell him to come to the studio. Well, actually I left a message on his answering machine. He showed up coming from the gym where’s he’s done many power squats and asked me “What we shootin’ Mike?” and I tell him to sit down and shut up you shit-for-brains. He sits down, but there is an immediate squish sound. It would appear that Rich had soiled his large diaper. He claimed he didn’t know. He insisted he ONLY wears a diaper when he does power squats at the gym. 1. it helps stifle the sound of any accidental fart release, but also for… you know what. An accidental Hershey squirt. This is apparently what happened. Luckily a very large toddler had died outside our building and I was able to provide Rich Evans with replacement clothing. A lot went into this video. So please, enjoy.","title":"Beyond The Black Void - Watchbait","duration":1896,"channel_id":"UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA","author":"RedLetterMedia","date":"20230718","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeMadjM0ZZI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UeMadjM0ZZI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":642625}}

While dad Mack is content to keep his family safe paddling around their New England pond forever, mom Pam is eager to shake things up and show their kids—teen son Dax and duckling daughter Gwen—the whole wide world. After a migrating duck family alights on their pond with thrilling tales of far-flung places, Pam persuades Mack to embark on a family trip, via New York City, to tropical Jamaica. \n\nAs the Mallards make their way South for the winter, their well-laid plans quickly go awry. The experience will inspire them to expand their horizons, open themselves up to new friends and accomplish more than they ever thought possible, while teaching them more about each other—and themselves—than they ever imagined. \n\nFrom a screenplay by Mike White, the Emmy winning creator of The White Lotus and the screenwriter of School of Rock, the film stars a top-flight comedic cast led by Oscar® and Emmy nominee Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick, Eternals) as anxious Mallard dad Mack and Emmy nominee Elizabeth Banks (Hunger Games and Pitch Perfect franchises) as Pam, the Mallards’ daring, quick-witted matriarch.\n\nCaspar Jennings plays Dax, the Mallards’ confident and restless son, and, in her feature film debut, Tresi Gazal plays Gwen, the family’s innocent and lovable daughter.\n\nGolden Globe winner Awkwafina (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) voices the scrappy leader of a New York City pigeon gang; Emmy winner and Oscar® nominee Carol Kane (The Princess Bride) plays Erin the heron, the first friend that the Mallards make on their journey; Emmy winner Keegan-Michael Key (The Super Mario Bros. Movie, The Lion King) voices a homesick Jamaican parrot locked away in a Manhattan restaurant, and BAFTA winner David Mitchell (Peep Show) plays the yogic leader of a mysterious duck farm. Legendary Emmy winner and Oscar® nominee Danny DeVito (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) co-stars as Mack’s curmudgeonly, adventure-averse Uncle Dan. \n\nDirected by Benjamin Renner, the Oscar®-nominated filmmaker of Ernest & Celestine and The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales, Migration is a visual spectacle unlike any in Illumination’s acclaimed history, featuring elevated, expressionist artistry and Illumination’s signature subversive humor and authentic heart, unforgettable characters and joyful soundtrack. \n\nProduced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri, Migration is a film about overcoming your fears and opening yourself up to the world and its opportunities. The film is co-directed by Guylo Homsy (Head of Layout and Cinematography for Sing and Sing 2), edited by Christian Gazal (Happy Feet, Peter Rabbit) and the Production Designer is Colin Stimpson (The Secret Life of Pets 2).","title":"Migration | Official Trailer","duration":192,"channel_id":"UCq7OHvWO6Z3u-LztFdrcU-g","author":"Illumination","date":"20230718","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQfo0HJhCnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cQfo0HJhCnE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":11661468}}

Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry's ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry's neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry's eccentric neighbor, Kramer.\n\n#Seinfeld #LarryDavid #TheBeard\n\nGeorge's Toupée Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeld\nhttps://bit.ly/OfficialSeinfeld","title":"George's Toupée Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeld","duration":310,"channel_id":"UCKv01ZGOJhp2HbtDe4EvS8A","author":"Seinfeld","date":"20230717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVBbqvLtWBs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVBbqvLtWBs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":685828}}

{"description":"A new film by Alexander Payne, director of SIDEWAYS and THE DESCENDANTS. Paul Giamatti stars in THE HOLDOVERS, in select theaters October 27, everywhere November 10.\n\nFrom acclaimed director Alexander Payne, THE HOLDOVERS follows a curmudgeonly instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who is forced to remain on campus during Christmas break to babysit the handful of students with nowhere to go.  Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them -- a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) -- and with the school’s head cook, who has just lost a son in Vietnam (Da’Vine Joy Randolph).\n\nhttps://www.focusfeatures.com/the-holdovers\nhttps://twitter.com/HoldoversFilm\nhttps://www.instagram.com/TheHoldoversFilm\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheHoldoversFilm\nhttps://www.threads.net/@TheHoldoversFilm\n\nSubscribe to Focus Features: http://bit.ly/FocusFeaturesYouTube\n\nBecome a Focus Insider: https://insider.focusfeatures.com \n\nWebsite: https://www.focusfeatures.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/focusfeatures\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/focusfeatures\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/focusfeatures","title":"THE HOLDOVERS - Official Trailer [HD] - In Select Theaters October 27, Everywhere November 10","duration":165,"channel_id":"UCU4SM3j_9TNWaSu8KdGV50g","author":"Focus Features","date":"20230717","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhKLpJmHhIg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/AhKLpJmHhIg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":6237103}}
{"description":"My friend hid 5 items: one in each element. If they are individually brought back to him, you receive a cash prize. If someone miraculously acquires all 5, they receive the Grand Prize. I don't know what the Grand Prize is, but I need it. This is why It's Impossible to Find this Item:\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VeVDgNgv8V\nPodcast: @testrunpodcast \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Tubbo / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy! \n\nThanks to Slatcho for the help editing: https://linktr.ee/slatcho?utm_source=linktree_admin_share\n\nIf anyone on School SMP is reading this: \n\nWe did it! High school went by so fast, and although I didn't really enjoy calculating velocity vectors or writing 5 paragraph essays with a \"works cited\", I would never take back a single moment that I had with you all. I've come to realize that friendship is one of the most valuable things in the world, and I can't thank you enough. You all supported me when YouTube was just a dream, and you never changed when that dream became a reality. But, you did so much more. You made me crack up when I was at my lowest points. You pushed me when I didn't feel like moving forward. You were all so true to yourself, and I appreciate you all so much for that. 7 years zipped by, but the memories we made together will stick with me forever. I was gonna submit a speech for graduation, but I'd much rather make a YouTube video XD. I'm gonna miss you guys, but I'll always have your back no matter what.
