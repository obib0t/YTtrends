{"description":"Today AD is welcomed to Columbus, Ohio by Debby Ryan and Josh Dun for a tour of their fascinating, ‘treehouse fantasy’ home. It might be surprising to hear of a sparkling young actor and her rocker husband setting up their first house in the “Arch City,” but Ryan and Dun relish an impulsive departure from the script. When they discovered the property and decided to make it their home, the actor and musician tapped Fawn Galli and Ashley Moyer to bring their domestic dream to life. From a basement boxing ring and a cold-plunge pool on the back porch, to a recording studio and a dramatic stone bust of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, that dream has come to full fruition. “I remember walking through the house and feeling like there was so much room to put our personalities into it,” says Dun. “Not only was this the first house that we designed together, but it was really the first time that both of us felt the freedom to put our mark on a place.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Debby and Josh's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-debby-ryan-and-josh-duns-treehouse-fantasy-home-in-columbus-ohio\r\n\r\nShop Debby and Josh’s home style!\r\n\r\nPlants/accessories:\r\nPolspotten Set of 4 Tattoo Cups: https://fave.co/40cH4Rc\r\nStagg Electric Kettle: https://amzn.to/42o4wge\r\n(Similar) Olivia & May 2 Piece Modern Ceramic Planter Pots: https://goto.target.com/4P5jaG\r\nHero Giant Corn Stool: https://amzn.to/3n8oyuO\r\n(Similar) Super Moss Deco Moss Small Mushroom: https://amzn.to/42ouCj7\r\n(Similar) Pose Mirror Hand Embellished: https://fave.co/3JTGe6D\r\nOpalhouse Outdoor Ceramic Planter: https://goto.target.com/9gGaVQ\r\nByredo Tree House Candle: https://fave.co/3LFYt0u\r\nMasion Margiela ‘REPLICA’ By The Fireplace Candle: https://fave.co/3JVwXuR\r\n(Similar) Sizikato Frog Incense Burner: https://amzn.to/3JVqHDn\r\nAcrylic Four in a Row: https://fave.co/3Z7cAyR\r\nPlunge The Cold Plunge: https://fave.co/402EsWb\r\n\r\nLighting:\r\nUrban Outfitters Wally Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3lpHxkj\r\nElk Home Transit Chandelier: https://fave.co/3Jvd5gG\r\nEtsy Gallery Paint Co.

{"description":"Months after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, I began filming the U.S. Army’s 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment (known as the Gunners) in Baghdad. The unit was housed in a bombed-out palace on the banks of the Tigris that they named Gunner Palace.\n\nRather than just making a movie about the men, I suggested that we make a film together — an offer that the soldiers quickly embraced. They told the story of the war as only they could: They played guitar, spat out rhymes and played to the camera. But behind all their bravado and posturing, they were just kids who desperately wanted the world to understand the war through their eyes.\n\nIn the last two months of 2003, the Gunners lost three men to I.E.D. attacks. They scrambled to create makeshift armor for their soft-skinned vehicles using scrap metal. When asked by a soldier about the lack of armor in 2004, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said, “You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.”\n\nThey were the army we had. They fought an enemy they couldn’t always see in a land they didn’t understand for reasons that were never entirely clear. In the midst of the pandemic, I visited the men and spoke with them about how they make sense of their role in a war that has yet to be fully reckoned with. In \"The Army We Had,\" the veterans grapple with a past that still reverberates powerfully through their lives.\n\n- Text by Michael Tucker\n- Film by Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker\n\nMore from The New York Times Video: \nRead more: https://nyti.ms/42cxzDc\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n​​\nWatch all of our videos here: http://nytimes.com/video​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nytvideo​​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nytvideo​​\n----------\nOp-Docs is a forum for short, opinionated documentaries by independent filmmakers.

And make sure to follow me @safiyany on flip :)\n\nAnd thanks so much to Julia from Agile Styling for her consult! You can find her website and find out more about her color matching and styling services here: https://www.agilestyling.com/\n\nAnd follow her on TikTok & Instagram at: @agile_styling !\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! Today it’s all about color - and as someone who is known for wearing almost only black, I decided to dip my toes into the personal color analysis trend I've been hearing about for years and seeing all over TikTok. Because I've always been curious... am I a winter? Autumn? Summer? Or even Spring? Pastels have never been my forte, but I was open to at least *hearing* about them. So, we took a little detour to Toronto and visited Julia Dobkine from Agile Styling, an expert in color analysis who I’d been following on Tiktok, to find out my colors, my season, my tones, and everything underneath those tones. What do you guys think? Would you try this?\n\nAlso, thanks to the virtual color analysts, the color key, for their help in fact-checking the video and collaborating on celebrities for the 12 seasons for our graphics! To learn your season virtually, check out @‌thecolorkey_ on Instagram! **celebrities shown here are examples based on the color key's best classification done in good faith but without participation in the color key analysis process. Accurate results can only be achieved through their color analysis process!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nMelissa Douglas\nPhil Kinney\nElizabeth Pinotti\nClare Gelber\nBree von Bradsky\nNez Covington\nIshara Mathews\nHailey Cox\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\n0:00 Intro\n3:20 Flying to Canada\n5:08 The Color Analyzing Process\n7:15 Finding Out My Undertones\n12:49 Finding Out My Colors' Brightness & Depth\n14:55 My Palette vs Other Palettes\n16:40 Shopping My Color Palette\n21:46 Doing Makeup in My Color Palette\n23:00 The Final Look\n24:31 Outro","title":"I Got A Professional Color Analysis","duration":1522,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230319","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvFD5KBAb0Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zvFD5KBAb0Q/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1650116}}

In this video, we continue our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support this potentially history-altering theory.\n\nMY SOCIALS:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/miniminuteman/\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@miniminuteman\nE-Mail (Business inquiries only.

The hilarious and unapologetically explicit story of identity and self-discovery centers on four unlikely friends who embark on a once-in-a-lifetime international adventure. When Audrey’s (Ashley Park) business trip to Asia goes sideways, she enlists the aid of Lolo (Sherry Cola), her irreverent, childhood best friend who also happens to be a hot mess; Kat (Stephanie Hsu), her college friend turned Chinese soap star; and Deadeye (Sabrina Wu), Lolo’s eccentric cousin. Their no-holds-barred, epic experience becomes a journey of bonding, friendship, belonging, and wild debauchery that reveals the universal truth of what it means to know and love who you are. \n\nAlso starring Ronny Chieng (Crazy Rich Asians), Lori Tan Chinn (Awkwafina is Nora From Queens), David Denman (Greenland), Annie Mumolo (Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar), Desmond Chiam (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier), Alexander Hodge (Insecure), and Chris Pang (Crazy Rich Asians).","title":"Joy Ride (2023) Official Red Band Trailer - Ashley Park, Sherry Cola, Stephanie Hsu, Sabrina Wu","duration":152,"channel_id":"UCJ6nMHaJPZvsJ-HmUmj1SeA","author":"Lionsgate Movies","date":"20230317","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyI-AM5VXDo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jyI-AM5VXDo/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":441765}}
{"description":"Robin Hilton | March 17, 2023\nIt's hard to overstate the kindness and good-natured humor Bono and The Edge brought to the Tiny Desk. When they first arrived at the NPR Music offices, Bono spoke on an imaginary phone, \"The talent's here! The talent's coming through,\" poking fun at their own fame, while carrying The Edge's guitar. (The Edge called Bono the best roadie he's ever had.) The two never stopped beaming, like two overjoyed newcomers thrilled at the chance to play for someone.\n\nThe performance was a preview of U2's new album, Songs Of Surrender, featuring stripped-down versions of songs from across the band's catalog. To help pull off several reimagined songs from the 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, Bono and The Edge invited a teen choir from the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, D.C., to join them. During rehearsals, Bono told the students to think of \"Beautiful Day\" as the kind of \"post-drinking\" singalong you'd bellow with friends after leaving a bar. He then quickly realized none of them are old enough to drink, before feigning a heart attack.\n\nTraveling without bassist Adam Clayton or drummer Larry Mullen Jr., Bono and The Edge made the trip from Ireland to the States specifically for the Tiny Desk, arriving in D.C. after five days of rehearsals at Bono's New York apartment. When they settled in for the performance, they treated the office to four songs, including a deeply emotional version of \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of,\" written for the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence, and a reworked version of \"Walk On,\" which Bono said was inspired by and dedicated to the people of Ukraine.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Beautiful Day\"\n\"In a Little While\"\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\"\n\"Walk On\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBono: vocals\nThe Edge: guitar, vocals\nDuke Ellington School of the Arts Choir: Petra Munter, Ayan Yacob, Kirsten Holmes, Jayla Norwood, Dyor Taylor, Jaylyn Pickney, Jevon Skipper, Joshua Jennings, Jordan Freeman\nPatrick Lundy: choir director\nSpecial thanks to: Sandi Logan (principal/HOS), Isaac Daniel (assistant principal)\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nEditor: Maia Stern\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel, Michael Zamora \nAudio Assistant: Alex Drewenskus\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galván\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #u2 #bono #theedge","title":"Bono and The Edge: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1272,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20230317","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxo-loXdcH0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oxo-loXdcH0/hqdefault.jpg?v=64126762","content":{"View count":858609}}

{"description":"This woolly guy isn’t sheepish when it comes to bringing in more Cult of the Lamb followers. He can’t be: whenever The Lamb leaves camp, the goal is always to bring back at least one more Cult of the Lamb follower. It’s doubly important when your one true love can leave this world at a moment’s notice. Of course… that’s when you just quickly have yourself a Cult of the Lamb marriage. Look, when you’ve got the power, you can pretty much do what you want.\n\nThe thing is that some supporters can turn nasty when they think your Cult of the Lamb is poop. They might just start calling it Cult of the Lamb Poop… and then want to eat poop and… it becomes a whole thing. Then you’ve got yourself a Cult of the Lamb dissenter, and no one needs that; not I, not ewe.

{"description":"Colleton County Sheriff's Detectives Laura Rutland, Daniel Greene and Jason Chapman were among the first on the scene the night of June 7, 2021, after Alex Murdaugh murdered his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul. \nWhile it was almost unthinkable in the first few hours after the killings, these detectives said they picked up right away on things that weren't adding up -- primarily focusing on Murdaugh's demeanor, emotions and body language. Plus, the detectives respond to rampant criticism of investigators throughout the trial, saying some of the complaints against them were far from fair or reasonable. \n\nJoin hosts Anne Emerson, Charlie Condon and Drew Tripp as they discuss the new details learned from this exclusive interview.\n\nWant to hear more from the Colleton County investigators?

{"description":"Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken - In Theaters This Summer\n\nSometimes the hero you are meant to be lies just beneath the surface. \n\nThis summer, DreamWorks Animation dives into the turbulent waters of high school with a hilarious, heartfelt action comedy about a shy teenager who discovers that she’s part of a legendary royal lineage of mythical sea krakens and that her destiny, in the depths of the oceans, is bigger than she ever dreamed. \n\nSweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. \n\nShe’s math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she’s prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar® nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. \n\nBut when she breaks her mom’s #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award® winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. \n\nThe Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There’s one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school’s beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt’s Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most. \n\nRuby Gillman, Teenage Kraken stars an extraordinary cast that includes Emmy winner Colman Domingo (Fear the Walking Dead) as Ruby’s supportive dad, Emmy nominee Sam Richardson (Veep) as Ruby’s enthusiastic uncle and Blue Chapman (Council of Dads) as Ruby’s cool little brother. \n\nDirected by Academy Award® nominated filmmaker Kirk DeMicco (Vivo, The Croods) and produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella (Trolls World Tour, Trolls), with Faryn Pearl (The Croods: A New Age, Trolls World Tour) serving as co-director, the film features a comedic powerhouse supporting cast, including Emmy nominee Will Forte (The Last Man on Earth), Emmy nominee Nicole Byer (Nailed It!), YouTube Diamond creator Liza Koshy (Liza on Demand), Ramona Young (Never Have I Ever), Eduardo Franco (Stranger Things) and Echo Kellum (Arrow). \n\nSocial Handles\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/teenagekrakenmovie  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/teenagekrakenmovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.teenagekrakenmovie.com \n#TeenageKrakenMovie","title":"RUBY GILLMAN, TEENAGE KRAKEN | Official Trailer","duration":144,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230316","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAMKwDsfUeU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iAMKwDsfUeU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4000222}}

{"description":"Nice to see Coruscant again.\nFelt the ep dragged on too long with Pershing\nMando and Bo Katan are fun, Bo has ulterior motives to control the Mythosaur and rule Mandalore. \n\nAt pershing’s day job he tires to salvage some files from the empire that come across his desk, but he’s told to not do that and discard it. He thinks it’s ridiculous as the information can really help the new republic, but they simply refuse to do so. He’s getting angry at the new republic and beginning to resent them for sure. He grabs an imperial biscuit and we jump to him being questioned again by the robot with the same mundane questions. At the question of whether or not is he feeling resentment towards the new republic or not, he pauses, looks down, and rubs his ear. The same ear he rubbed when talking to the people in the opera chambers that he didn’t mean to do anything bad when working at the empire. The robot repeats itself, and he says no. Heading to G68 he says let’s continue the cloning work, and asks for her help to get the lab equipment. Immediately the plagueis theme plays and this is probably the biggest part of the episode for me, because it implies the ominous tone of palpatine telling anakin about plagueis in the opera. Does this mean they’ll bring plagueis back in star wars? Does this mean that it’s just a cool theme that’s supposed to make us think of betrayal and deceit? I guess we’ll find out.\nthey head to the train station and get to the scrapyards where the imperial star destroyers are held. This takes about 7 minutes of hopping trams to avoid ticket droid guards. Arriving at the junkyard…That’s where she’s taking him, to collect supplies from the ship, they enter and she introduces herself as Elia, and he as Dr Penn Pershing. Pershing gets to the imperial lab, grabbing what he needs, they hear a noise and vacate, only to be stopped by new republic police, where she grabs the case he just took from the ship for their mission, and gets him arrested. She set him up, framed him, and next we see him with some Mon Calamaris as he screams to them it was a trap, harkening to of course, admiral ackbar’s infamous line in return of the jedi. They set Pershing up to a mind flayer machine and the mon cala operator says it’s low voltage and not like a mind flayer, infact it’s used to heal, he says. Elia waits until the crew leaves as they turn the mind flayer on, and she cranks it up high, which erases his mind and memory. \n\nFinally getting back to Mando, they head to the armorer and the children of the watch where they’re hiding. Din tells Bo Katan to keep her helmet on as things will go smoother this way, since the clans have different beliefs. As they land, we see Paz Vizsla, who wanted to rule mandalore as he fought mando for it in the book of boba fett, losing, seems to be teeming with anger as he sees him land and bo katan with him. The history between Bo Katan and Pre Vizsla can be summed up like this. Bo and Pre Vizsla worked together under Death Watch, who believed that New Mandalorians \n\nlost their way of violence and conquering which was the way of the older mandalorians, so they waged civil war, until Bo felt he was a bit too crazy and left his group, rebelling against him. Paz Vizsla probalby sees her as a traitor and hates her.\nThe are approached by all the mandos there and Paz leads, telling them to leave as Din is no longer worthy of the mandalorian creed. He informs Paz Vizsla that he’s bathed in the living waters beneath the mines, as no one believes him. Bo Katan speaks up and says she was witness. And who are you, nite owl, says paz. Nite owls are just a faction of mandalorians led by bo katan after she left pre vizsla for his extremist ideologies. She announces who she is and he tells her that she’s lost her way, and both need to leave as they are apostates. Mando shows proof, so they send him up to the armorer, their leader, as she examines the vial of water sampled from the mines, and confirms indeed he has bathed in the waters, he is once again a mandalorian.\nShe says she too has joined the children of the watch since she bathed in the waters and hasn’t removed her helmet. I find it intersting the armorer knew right away that it was Bo Katan, this is very telling…that maybe the armorer knows who Bo is personally. Maybe the armorer, with her spikes on her head, or rather horns, was a member of the mauldalorians when darth maul ruled mandalore. I think she might be Rook Kast, who was loyal to Maul after he defeated her former leader, pre vizsla and organized the mandalorians against Ahsoka during the siege of Mandalore. That’d be wild since Bo and Ahsoka are friends and allies, and Rook Kast and Bo Katan are not. We’ll see who the armorer really is one day…\n\n\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/realswtheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Episode 3 BREAKDOWN PLAGUEIS!
