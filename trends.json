{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, “I am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.”\n\n“For more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth”\n— Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853–1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One® is the Presenting Sponsor of this year’s Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank’s three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center’s producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018.

Coming to theaters in a while, crocodile. \n\nVisit our site:\nhttps://www.lylelylecrocodile.movie\n\nFollow Us on Social:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/LyleLyleCrocodileMovie\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LyleLyleCrocodileMovie\nhttps://twitter.com/LyleCrocodile\n\nSubscribe to the Sony Pictures YouTube Channel for more exclusive content: http://bit.ly/SonyPicsSubscribe\n\nBased on the best-selling book series by Bernard Waber, Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is a live-action/CGI musical comedy that brings this beloved character to a new, global audience.\n\nWhen the Primm family (Constance Wu, Scoot McNairy, Winslow Fegley) moves to New York City, their young son Josh struggles to adapt to his new school and new friends. All of that changes when he discovers Lyle - a singing crocodile (Shawn Mendes) who loves baths, caviar and great music-living in the attic of his new home. The two become fast friends, but when Lyle’s existence is threatened by evil neighbor Mr. Grumps (Brett Gelman), the Primm’s must band together with Lyle’s charismatic owner, Hector P. Valenti (Javier Bardem), to show the world that family can come from the most unexpected places and there’s nothing wrong with a big singing crocodile with an even bigger personality.\n\nLyle, Lyle, Crocodile will feature original songs performed by Shawn Mendes and written by the songwriting team behind The Greatest Showman, Benj Pasek & Justin Paul. Joining Pasek and Paul in writing original songs for the film are Ari Afsar, Emily Gardner Xu Hall, Mark Sonnenblick, and Joriah Kwamé. Directed and produced by Will Speck and Josh Gordon, the screenplay is by Will Davies. The film is produced by Hutch Parker and executive produced by Kevin K. Vafi, Dan Wilson, Robert J.

{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, “I am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.”\n\n“For more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth”\n— Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853–1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One® is the Presenting Sponsor of this year’s Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank’s three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center’s producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018. This year’s ceremony marks the 23rd year that the Kennedy Center’s marquee comedy award will be broadcast nationally.\n\nThe event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception in 1998.\n\n#TwainPrizePBS #JonStewart #SteveCarell\n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Steve Carell on Jon Stewart | 2022 Mark Twain Prize","duration":342,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20220622","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leN3PbNvi3c","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/leN3PbNvi3c/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":665802}}

{"description":"Danni Sanders (Zoey Deutch), an aimless aspiring writer with no friends, no romantic prospects and — worst of all — no followers, fakes an Instagram-friendly trip to Paris in the hopes of boosting her social media clout. When a terrifying incident strikes the City of Lights, Danni unwittingly falls into a lie bigger than she ever imagined. She \"returns\" a hero, even striking up an unlikely friendship with Rowan (Mia Isaac), a school-shooting survivor dedicated to societal change, and scooping up the man of her dreams Colin (Dylan O'Brien). As an influencer and advocate, Danni finally has the life and audience she always wanted. But it’s only a matter of time before the facade cracks, and she learns the hard way that the Internet loves a takedown.\n\nCast: Zoey Deutch, Dylan O'Brien, Mia Isaac\n\nSubscribe To Searchlight Pictures: https://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures\n\n#NotOkay #DylanOBrien #Searchlight \n\nConnect with Searchlight Online\nVisit the Searchlight WEBSITE: https://www.searchlightpictures.com/\nLike Searchlight on FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/searchlightpics\n\nNOT OKAY | Teaser Trailer | Searchlight Pictures\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures","title":"NOT OKAY | Teaser Trailer | Searchlight Pictures","duration":61,"channel_id":"UCor9rW6PgxSQ9vUPWQdnaYQ","author":"SearchlightPictures","date":"20220621","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hka85K3GUg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6hka85K3GUg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3442520}}

{"description":"https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nCommenting on the prize, Stewart said, “I am truly honored to receive this award. I have long admired and been influenced by the work of Mark Twain, or, as he was known by his given name, Samuel Leibowitz.”\n\n“For more than three decades, Jon Stewart has brightened our lives and challenged our minds as he delivers current events and social satire with his trademark wit and wisdom. For me, tuning into his television programs over the years has always been equal parts entertainment and truth”\n— Deborah F. Rutter, Kennedy Center President\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Stewart received a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853–1940). Previous recipients can be seen by scrolling down this page.\n\nCapital One® is the Presenting Sponsor of this year’s Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of the bank’s three-year, $3 million gift to fund Comedy at the Kennedy Center, a signature program at the Center focused on elevating comedy as an art form and uniting the community through laughter.\n\nThe 23rd Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is under the direction of the creative team from Done + Dusted, the Kennedy Center’s producing partner for the Mark Twain Prize since 2018. This year’s ceremony marks the 23rd year that the Kennedy Center’s marquee comedy award will be broadcast nationally.\n\nThe event was created by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky, Mark Krantz, and John Schreiber. The Kennedy Center is grateful to Cappy McGarr for his steadfast support of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since its inception in 1998.\n\n#TwainPrizePBS #JonStewart #StephenColbert\n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb","title":"Stephen Colbert on Jon Stewart | 2022 Mark Twain Prize","duration":379,"channel_id":"UCeJesXuEK5ERsyh-0DvM4PQ","author":"The Kennedy Center","date":"20220622","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbGlemVZsLc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/VbGlemVZsLc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":498371}}

{"description":"Let's find out if Pennzoil's motor oil (Pennzoil Synthetic Blend, Pennzoil Full Synthetic, Pennzoil Platinum and Pennzoil Ultra Platinum) are basically the oil.  All four oils tested sent to an independent oil lab for oil analysis. I tested oils for evaporative loss, lubricity or film strength, cold oil flow both new oil and after exposure to heat.

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 OUR NEXT SAILBOAT REVEALED\n02:54 Why We're Buying an HH44\n03:45 Parallel Hybrid Electric Engines ECO-DRIVE\n05:32 Insanely Large Lithium Battery Bank\n06:29 Largest Solar Array of ANY Production Catamaran\n08:11 Build Quality - CARBON FIBER & Epoxy Resins \n08:32 Easy to Sail & Clean Decks\n09:07 Performance Sailing & POLARS\n09:36 Amazing Cockpit Design\n10:26 Salon, All-Electric Galley & Forward Facing Nav\n11:45 Cabins, Hulls, Workshop & Pantry\n12:30 Our Next Plans & Delivery\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2022","title":"OUR NEW HYBRID ELECTRIC CATAMARAN","duration":834,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20220619","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKycrQ7_aI0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ZKycrQ7_aI0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":315199}}

{"description":"This is a journey that spanned multiple days as a total of 150,496 unique players controlled a single game of Pokémon Crystal. So huge thanks to @DougDoug allowed me to recreate my favorite historical event: Twitch Plays Pokémon.\n\nEven though this adventure originally started as a race between the Twitch Chat communities of other great trainers (@PointCrow, @CONEY, @Grand POOBear, @Linkus7, @Stanz, @Failboat, and DougDoug himself), it became something so much larger. Genuinely my favorite experience I've ever had as a creator. This story takes place over multiple days alongside several mental breakdowns. It wasn't easy, but at least it was possible. One day, I hope to venture off to create Twitch Plays Pokémon once again... as we continue onwards through the Kanto region... eventually...\n\nAlso, a massive shoutout to @Jaiden Animations, @Birdee’s , and even @PointCrow for stopping by during the stream that refused to end. :)\n\n➤ MERCH: http://pleasebuymymerch.com\n➤ TWITTER: https://twitter.com/alpharad\n➤ INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/alpharad\n#alpharad #pokemon #twitch\n\nVIDEO EDITOR:\n➤ me :)\n\nTHUMBNAIL ART:\n➤ Bobber: https://twitter.com/BobberWCC\n\nTHUMBNAIL DESIGN: \n➤ Crystel: http://twitter.com/crystei","title":"Recreating Twitch Plays Pokémon","duration":2026,"channel_id":"UCBODyKF0JMbUd6D9Bklyzbw","author":"Alpharad","date":"20220617","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGrcJC3gR4I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SGrcJC3gR4I/hqdefault.webp?v=62a8dc17","content":{"View count":1032621}}
