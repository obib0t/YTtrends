{"description":"Rents in New York City are at an all-time high. The median asking rent in Manhattan reached $4,100 in June 2022. CNBC Make It spoke to three New Yorkers whose rents increased up to $2,100 a month.\n\nBut are New Yorkers willing to pay up? One challenge for renters is the requirement that they earn 40 times the rent when applying for an apartment. With the median asking rent in Manhattan around $4,000, that means the minimum income to qualify for an apartment at that price is $160,000. The median household income in New York City is $67,000. \n\nSubscribe to CNBC Make It.: http://cnb.cx/2kxl2rf\n\nAbout CNBC Make It.: CNBC Make It. is a new section of CNBC dedicated to making you smarter about managing your business, career, and money.\n\nConnect with CNBC Make It.

In just one year since releasing his viral sensation “Never Comin’ Home,” the first song he’d ever written or performed, the rising singer/songwriter has already earned more than 100 million global streams to date and charted his latest release, “Fall In Love,” on the Billboard Hot 100. Born and raised in the small town of Louisville, IL, he grew up listening to hour after hour of country radio on long hauls across state lines with his father, who owned a trucking business. Back at home his mom instilled in him a life-long appreciation for the power chords and edgy vocals of 80’s hair rock. From long hours on the gas pipeline, to late nights of backbreaking roadwork, Zimmerman embodies the old school American values of hard work and dependability and applies the same steadfast mentality to his music. Through his plainspoken charm, contagious enthusiasm and genuine portrayal of life on the back roads, the up-and-comer has already attracted a loyal and passionate fan base. With more new music on the horizon, featuring the grit and gravel of his unmistakably Southern drawl, Zimmerman will continue to showcase the straightforward authenticity for which he is known and loved.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #WhereItEnds #LyricVideo","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Where It Ends (Lyric Video)","duration":180,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20220819","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7PHEPmdT1w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/C7PHEPmdT1w/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":424982}}

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #northpole #travel #travelvlog #arcticcruise\n\n0:00 2 week cruise to the NORTH POLE?!\n0:38 Flying to the northernmost city in the world\n2:01 Full tour of our luxury ice breaker ship!\n5:47 Deck 5: where things get interesting\n6:46 Why we love Athletic Greens\n7:58 First sight of ICE\n10:40 Restaurant #1\n11:14 Deck 6: Helicopter pad\n13:00 Deck 7: Luxury Duplex Suite\n13:25 The Bridge\n14:20 The Science Lab\n15:25 Deck 9: The Spa\n16:25 Fitness Center\n17:08 The Main Lounge\n18:18 Restraunt #2\n18:50 Outdoor heated pool\n20:05 Gala evening\n21:34 Midnight sun!!!","title":"WE BOARDED A CRUISE TO THE NORTH POLE (Full Ship Tour)","duration":1399,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220820","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb4cCdLiuSg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kb4cCdLiuSg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":540335}}

The album features four new tracks, including his current single “Come Back As A Country Boy.” Body Language Deluxe also features his Platinum-selling 28th country radio chart-topper, “Happy Anywhere” (featuring Gwen Stefani). Prior to “Happy Anywhere” Shelton celebrated a 2x Platinum, multi-week No. 1 with “Nobody But You,” which has now surpassed 280 million streams. The single made its TV debut on the 62nd GRAMMY Awards, where Shelton was also nominated for Best Country Solo Performance for his hit “God’s Country.” The 4x Platinum smash earned the 2019 CMA Award and 2020 ACM Award for Single of the Year. As his award wins approach the hundreds, Shelton remains a force in the industry with ACM (5), AMA (3), CMA (10), CMT (11) and People’s Choice Awards (7), among many others. He recently wrapped his headlining “Friends and Heroes 2021” tour with Lindsay Ell and special appearances by Martina McBride, Tracy Byrd and Trace Adkins.\n\nAs a coach for the Emmy Award-winning television show The Voice, Shelton is an eight-time champion, most recently with his contestant Cam Anthony. The Grand Ole Opry member also remains focused on his Ole Red partnership with Ryman Hospitality, with locations currently in Tishomingo, Nashville, Gatlinburg and Orlando.

{"description":"Cooking My Favourite Meal With My Sister! Easily one of my best go to meals to cook, packed with protein and easy to make.\n\nTry this power bowl and let me know your thoughts! \n\nPower Bowl Recipe:\nServings: 3 \n\nIngredients: \nSALMON INGREDIENTS: \n ⁃ 3 salmon filets \n ⁃ 2 tbsp olive oil \n ⁃ Seasoning 1-2 tbsp each = lemon pepper, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder \n\nSWEET POTATOES: \n ⁃ 2 sweet potatoes peeled (Season with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder) \n\nSWEET POTATO SAUCE: \n ⁃ 2 tbsp honey \n ⁃ 2 tbsp red wine vinegar \n ⁃ 1 squirt of siracha \n ⁃ 1/4 cup buffalo sauce \n\nPOWER BOWL TOPPINGS: \n ⁃ 1 long cucumber peeled & cut \n ⁃ Brown rice (1 cup each serving)\n ⁃ About 3 cups of arugula \n ⁃ 3 avocados \n ⁃ 3 cups mushrooms (season with salt, pepper, olive oil, garlic powder) \n\nGREEN GODDESS DRESSING: \n ⁃ 1 cup cilantro \n ⁃ 1 cup parsley \n ⁃ 1/2 cup mint \n ⁃ 1/2 cup basil \n ⁃ 1/2 cup Olive oil \n ⁃ 1 clove garlic \n ⁃ 1 lime \n\nHOW TO: \n1. Start off by washing & cutting/ chopping all your ingredients, cilantro, basil, mint, parsley. \n2. Peel your cucumber and sweet potatoes, cut cucumbers into cubes and sweet potatoes into one inch bites.\n3. After all the ingredients are chopped, start making your green goddess dressing in the food processor by adding in the cilantro, parsley, basil, mint, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper, and lime.\n4. Pre heat the oven to 425 after you finish making the dressing. start seasoning the sweet potatoes & mushrooms. \n5. Once the sweet potatoes and mushrooms are seasoned, place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet with olive oil & aluminum so they don’t stick. Pop in microwave for about 15-20 minutes and flip them half way. \n6. Once you pop the sweet potatoes in the oven start seasoning your fish. \n7. Season all the fish to taste and start heating up your pans so you can cook the mushrooms & salmon.\n8. Once the pans are hot, add your mushrooms and fish. Use two different pans, but if you only have one pan, cook the mushrooms first and then the fish. Cook the fish for about 3-5 minutes on each side on medium to low heat and cover the pan, make sure you are checking it so you don’t over cook it. Cook your mushrooms for about 5-10 minutes (or however you like them cooked) while your fish is cooking.\n9. Make sure you don’t forget to flip the sweet potatoes half way. Once everything is done cooking, let sweet potatoes cool off and start making the sweet potato sauce. Once sweet potatoes are cool, add the sauce and then start adding on the rest of the toppings.

{"description":"We all knew it was coming, but here it is, the new 992 generation 911 GT3 RS. It’s packed with racing tech, and probably some actual magic to make the most hardcore, exciting 911 to date. Power comes from a naturally aspirated 4.0-litre flat six producing 518bhp. Porsche says it’ll hit 184mph flat out, with 0-62mph taking just 3.2 seconds. Being an RS, it’s not going to be chunky – thanks to lightweight materials like Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic, it weighs just 1,450kgs with fluids. It’s all very impressive, but if you’re going to learn all there is to know about a new Porsche GT car there’s only one man you need to talk to, and that's Andreas Preuninger.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n00:42 The Numbers\n01:41 GT3 RS History\n03:10 Front Design Details\n05:13 Aero\n05:47 Profile Design Details\n06:56 Rear Design Details\n07:47 Active Rear Wing\n08:32 What Is DRS?\n08:55 Downforce\n09:36 Driving Modes & Adjustments\n11:23 Weight\n11:42 Interior & Weissach Pack\n12:28 Q+A with Andreas Preuninger\n33:52 Outro\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nMORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:\nWant to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?

{"description":"An overview of the 2022 Montana flooding and what's next for Yellowstone National Park.\n📅 Sign up for 80,000 Hours for help finding an impactful and rewarding career today: https://www.80000hours.org/practicalengineering\n\nIn June of 2022, many tourists and residents of the Yellowstone National Park area found themselves at ground zero of a natural disaster. Torrential rainfall in Wyoming and Montana brought widespread flooding to the streams and rivers that flow through this treasured landscape and beyond. How will the National Park Service Rebuild? Hasty engineering of large infrastructure can be extremely damaging to natural systems like those in Yellowstone, and you don’t want to invest millions of dollars into repairs that might be subject to similar flooding in the future. After all, we build parks (and roads to parks) to get closer to the natural environment and all its wildness, and there’s almost nothing more natural or wild than a flood.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
