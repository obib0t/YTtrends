{"description":"kenobi is once again reaching out to qui gon jinn, his old master. I guess in these 10 years he hasn‚Äôt been able to reach him. Yoda‚Äôs training hasn‚Äôt gone too well I guess.\nas he hears voices of the past, like yoda telling him only pain will you find, qui gon‚Äôs plea to train anakin, reverberations of anakin on mustafaor, we see Vader being put together, really connecting the fact that anakin and vader are now the same person physically. obi wan can feel vader, and tells quigon that he is coming. \n\nAs Vader walks out of his chamber, which looks lke the same one from Rogue One, we get a beautiful shot of mustafar and his castle. For those new to star wars, this is the same place where he fought obi-wan and lost, burning alive. This is also where in the comics, he opened a portal beneath his castle to bring back his dead wife padme, which of course didn‚Äôt work as planned. check out the marvel darth vader comics and darth momin for more about that.\nVader sits atop his obsidian throne, as he orders Reva around. Where is he, he says, and we hear this is james earl jones iconic voice. I feel it could be perfected with some audio engineering like how luke skywalker‚Äôs voice was made in the mandalorian, being completely computer generated.\nHe tells her that kenobi is all that matters, not the grand inquisitor. She clearly has lied and told Vader that Kenobi killed the GI, to which of course Vader will realize that this is impossible once he fights Kenobi and sees he‚Äôs pathetic.\n\nHe explains he knows what she wants, to be the grand inquisitor. If she brings him Kenobi, he will award her the promotion. If she fails, he‚Äôll terminate her. So Vader has definitely given the go ahead to the Empire to track Kenobi down, and notify him once they have him in near sight. Vader ends communication and gets up like a robot, his lightsaber hanging from his belt, emitter side up, just like the original trilogy. \n\n\nAs They land on Mapuzo, a mining system, we see a lifter droid and an R5 unit. R5 was the droid in a new hope that had the bad motivator, which was replaced by R2D2 to Luke Skywalker and Uncle Owen. This isn‚Äôt the same R5 unit, just a R5 unit.\n\nAs Obi-Wan looks out in to the distance, he sees dark side Anakin in his jedi robes. this is the first time we see Anakin played by hayden christensen in anything since revenge of the sith. I had to do a double take, I couldn‚Äôt believe it was him.\n\nThey enter a room that many Jedi have been in, this is a safe house, called the path. It all leads to Jabim, where they give the force sensitives captured by the empire, new identities and free them. As Leia asks what happens to them, it‚Äôs revealed no one ever sees them again. So I can say what happens to the is that the empire takes them in, and tries to convert them to the dark side. As Kenobi reveals carving on the walls from Quinlan Voss. This is amazing. We haven‚Äôt heard of Quinlan in forever, no one knew if he lived or died from Order 66. Quinlan was a powerful Jedi during the clone wars, he helped obi-wan on many missions and had a unique ability shared with Cal Kestis called psychometry.\n\nI think this is Hayden in the suit. \n\nKenobi runs away, and he‚Äôs stopped to see Vader infront of him. Igniting his crimson red lightsaber. Obi-Wan wants no part of this and runs away. Finally igniting his saber as Vader tells him he can‚Äôt hide forever.\n\nWe get the best line where Kenobi says what have you become? \nVader puases and says I am what you made me.\n\nThey fight and it doesn‚Äôt look good for Kenobi at all, Vader overpowers him and he‚Äôs literally toying with him. 10 years have led to this moment, where Vader wants KEnobi to suffer. He‚Äôs also extremely cautious, as in this 10 years he‚Äôs had time to reflect on everything, and realizes his loss could have been avoided had he not been so arrogant and quick to make decisions. Rageful Vader is learning about Kenobi, he‚Äôs more tactful, more experienced, and more patient, waiting for the right time to unleash. \n\nReva finds the safe house.\n\nVader lifts Kenobi with the dark side of the force, choking him, spilling flammable material, as Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber. \nIgniting the substance, Vader throws Obi-Wan into the fire, dragging him with the force, paying him back to how Obi-Wan left him on mustafar, burning alive. Telling him this is only the beginning for the pain he‚Äôs about to feel.\nVader clearly wants Obi-Wan to die very slowly, only after suffering to Vader‚Äôs enjoyment. That‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt go all out, he‚Äôs savouring the moment. Playing with his food before he eats. As Storm troopers come, Vader orders them to bring him, when one is shot by the lady helping obi-wan, and she explodes a cannister into massive flames. Vader watches Kenobi being picked up by the loader droid who i think is wrecker or Rex, and we see the flames in his lenses. Symbolizing his rage and his past with obi-wan, the fires that turned him into who he is today.","title":"OBI-WAN KENOBI EPISODE 3 BREAKDOWN VADER","duration":1322,"channel_id":"UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q","author":"Star Wars Theory","date":"20220601","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdtsSdlpa_Q","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OdtsSdlpa_Q/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":682792}}

{"description":"Listen to me very closely. School is one of the best opportunities to make friends that you will ever get in your entire life. I hated going to school, but think of it this way: You and a ton of people your age are all forced to hang out every. single. day. That's an incredible opportunity! Once you graduate, it'll get 100x more difficult to make friends, so make the most of it while you can.\n\nAnd don't forget: People won't remember what you said, they only remember how you made them feel. So above all, be kind.\n\nSorry for taking so long to post this! I really think it's our highest quality video though, so hopefully the wait was worth it!

{"description":"This is the really very final production version of the 1,000bhp+ Mercedes-AMG One. That‚Äôs right, on AMG‚Äôs 55th anniversary comes the long-awaited hyper-F1 car for the road. Not a figure of speech, but a fact, because the AMG One famously uses the 1.6-litre turbo hybrid V6 from Hamilton‚Äôs F1 car. Well, when Hamilton‚Äôs F1 car was fast. AMG worked closely with the F1 bods at Brixworth to build a turbocharged combustion engine with four electric motors: one on the turbo, another on the engine and two driving the front wheels, each able to spin up to 50,000rpm. The whipcrack quick V6 is mounted in the middle, and revs to 11,000rpm ‚Äì a little shy of Murray‚Äôs T.50 and the Aston Martin Valkyrie, but still. Eleven thousand. More F1 tech arrives in the shape of the MGU-K, which harvests surplus exhaust gas energy and stores it in the battery or feeds it straight into the electrified front axle. With everything singing together ‚Äì MGU-K, MGU-H, front axle motors and engine ‚Äì the whole thing punches out 1,048bhp. Hilariously, AMG can‚Äôt tell us the torque figure because of the ‚Äúcomplex drivetrain‚Äù. That‚Äôs right, the One is too complex for human minds. Estimated performance figures are as follows: 0-62mph in 2.9s, 0-124mph in 7.0s, 0-186mph in 15.6s and a top speed of 219mph. On the other end of the scale, it‚Äôs capable of just over 11 miles on battery power alone, while combined emissions stand at 198g/km. And how does this 1,695kg monster look? ‚ÄòMuscular‚Äô is how AMG describes it, and there‚Äôs no denying its presence. Low, wide with a ‚Äòwasp‚Äô waist designed for optimum aero efficiency, it‚Äôs said to generate downforce from as little as 31mph. Which should make the drive to your weekly shop very entertaining. It‚Äôs been a long time coming, but has the wait been worth it?

Since they'd have to be at least 25 years old to qualify for importation, the guys would have to choose cars from the greatest decade - the '90s.  Tyler brought a heavily modified BMW E30 325i hot rod from Lebanon, Freddy lets his JDM freak flag fly with an inappropriate Mazda RX-7, and Ed outdoes himself and shows up in the most offensive TVR Cerbera ever made. They are then told to meet at the Freedom Factory for a race.

{"description":"In this video, I put 1000 Minecraft players in a massive prison. There were 1000 cells, 100 guards, and 1 warden. Each player only had one life.

Find out now!\n\nJOIN MY DISCORD SERVER:\nhttps://discord.gg/state\n\nMore info:\nOut of 4000+ applicants, 1040 players were accepted to play in my prison event. On the first day, players were led from a giant boat into the prison, where they explored their new home. The prison consisted of four large plots where players could build, long hallways with cells and bathrooms, a cafeteria, an infirmary, and the Warden's Tower.\nSome prisoners grouped up to cause trouble, while others remained peaceful. Guards functioned within a hierarchy‚Äîwarden, deputy warden, elite team, prison guard, and perimeter team.\nSome of the visuals and audio in this video were recorded after the server ended and are not from the actual event.

Find out more in this Yelan Showcase F2P 4-star Weapon VIDEO!!!\n\nThis video focuses on exploring most relevant Yelan teams as well Yelan damage I've tested during the time I was given on the special miHoYo media server. These results we're compiled and compared when using Yelan Support build which is a rather unusual build Yelan uses but at the same time, it's really easy to get it up and going and see the results with her immediately.\n\nStill, Yelan skills are a bit confusing so I spend some time showcasing you how Yelan kit works and in sort of a way, show you the basics of Yelan guide you will see coming out in the future. \n\nSo while Yelan build and Yelan guide is a work in progress, this video focuses on Yelan showcase and Yelan gameplay - with a lot of really interesting teams, like Double Hydro Yelan and DPS Yelan team variations. Let me tell you - one of these teams blew my mind!\n\nYelan was released during 2.7 Genshin Impact update.\n\nGenshin Impact is an open-world gacha game that's available on PC, PS4, PS5 and mobile devices (iOS & Android).

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n #travel #travelvlog #alcatraz \n\n0:00 Our biggest fear\n0:50 Why are we doing this?!\n3:41 Seeing Alcatraz for the first time\n4:19 INSIDE Alcatraz (prison tour)\n5:50 What we are wearing to swim\n7:29 BEST VPN\n8:35 MORNING OF THE SWIM\n12:42 JUMPING IN the San Francisco Bay\n19:19 Our final thoughts on the swim","title":"WE ATTEMPTED THE DEADLY SWIM (Alcatraz to San Francisco)","duration":1410,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220528","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6H4dLs9kGU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M6H4dLs9kGU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1150994}}

{"description":"Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 - NEW TRAILER 2022 | NetPro's Concept Version\n\nThis trailer is a concept-mashup that shows my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the teaser trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 might look like.       \n____________________________________________\n‚óñMade/Edited By NetPro ‚óó\n‚ñª netfl.pro192@gmail.com\n____________________________________________\n\n‚óÖ On our channel we create –∞ trailer mashups ‚ñª\nalso known as recut trailers, involve collecting multiple pieces of film footage from one or multiple movies and editing them to create a new trailer. Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 101, and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.\n\nThere is no intention of infringing on anyone's intellectual property. This is not intended to deceive or defraud anyone; rather, it is intended to give fans a taste of what the film may be like. I don't own the material; I simply produce trailers for fans and others who are excited about a movie.\n\nThe trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.\n____________________________________________\n\nAbout Poppy Playtime:\n\nA survival horror video game with puzzle elements, developed and published by indie developer MOB Games. It was released on Steam for Windows on October 12, 2021. The game tells the story of a former employee who visits an abandoned factory of children's toys, formerly owned by the gaming company Playtime Co., 10 years after its employees disappeared without a trace.","title":"Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 - NEW TRAILER 2022 | NetPro's Concept Version","duration":59,"channel_id":"UCgLKyuJH2kaZX5sIJLKZ_aQ","author":"NetPro","date":"20220528","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7PsjG_cUFs","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l7PsjG_cUFs/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":4836265}}
