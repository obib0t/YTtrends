But recently, a new name has become synonymous with indie film culture and appeal, and it’s not an individual, but a studio.\n\nYou have to admit, their logo is pretty cool.\n\nA24 swept the 2022 Oscars. They’ve made some of the most distinct and interesting movies and TV shows of the past 10 years. But most importantly, they’ve garnered a reputation for quality — and their brand loyalty so strong that hipster film bros everywhere are wearing A24 t-shirts and caps right now.\n\nBut unlike Universal or Paramount, studios that have been around for over a century, A24 has done this in just over a decade. How did this independent film distributor transform into a major player in the entertainment industry in such a short time?\n\nIn this Vox Video, Nate Jones (senior writer at Vulture, and A24 obsessor) breaks down their history, and stratospheric rise to the top.

{"description":"Sponsor: Deepcool AK620 Zero Dark on Amazon https://geni.us/apRI9Q\nASUS' actions relating to the Exploding Ryzen CPU debacle are disgraceful and abrasive to the trust that the brand has earned. ASUS has demonstrated clearly it wishes to not only avoid supporting users, but actively engineers ways to abandon them. ASUS' updates haven't even fixed the problems, yet they posture as if they have while simultaneously suggesting that users 'just run defaults' on their $700 motherboards, as if that makes any sense whatsoever. So, to accommodate ASUS' request, we ran defaults and re-benchmarked the Ryzen 7000 series. It sucks. Big surprise. They also don't support their own BIOSes for the ASUS ROG boards.\n\nSupport us!

But their mission is complicated by the beginning of a geopolitical firestorm: The American Revolution has arrived. In the seventh season of OUTLANDER, Jamie, Claire, and their family are caught in the violent birth pains of an emerging nation as armies march to war and British institutions crumble in the face of armed rebellion.\nThe land the Frasers call home is changing – and they must change with it. In order to protect what they’ve built, the Frasers have to navigate the perils of the Revolutionary War. They learn that sometimes to defend what you love, you have to leave it behind. As the conflict draws them out of North Carolina and into the heart of this fight for independence, Jamie, Claire, Brianna, and Roger are faced with impossible decisions that have the potential to tear their family apart.","title":"Outlander | Season 7 Official Trailer | STARZ","duration":162,"channel_id":"UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw","author":"STARZ","date":"20230511","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxurD9SYbog","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gxurD9SYbog/hqdefault.jpg?v=645d26e3","content":{"View count":4866161}}

Maybe you’ve seen it as glowing green goop in The Simpsons, or as a  radioactive threat on the news. Either way, you likely know it has been a major block to the use and improvement of nuclear power. Over the last few decades, experts, politicians and the public have had heated debates over what to do with this radioactive material created by nuclear power plants.\n\nBut what if there were a way to not just store nuclear waste, but actually USE it? \n\nThis video is about the effort to make electricity out of nuclear waste. Really. It turns out, we developed the tools to do this decades ago. This story is about a technology we left behind and the people who want to bring it back.\n\nFor this video, I had the privilege of visiting one of the largest and oldest research centers in the US, the Argonne National Laboratory. I’m incredibly grateful to the researchers and staff I met there, and for their time in showing me their work. I also had the opportunity to speak with representatives from Oklo, a company working on new forms of nuclear power, including recycling nuclear waste as fuel. One of the best parts of making Huge If True is meeting and learning from people pushing what we can do in the hopes of improving the world for everyone else.\n\nChapters: \n00:00 Nuclear waste isn’t what I thought\n02:21 How I got obsessed\n03:27 How much energy is in nuclear waste?\n05:31 Thank you Storyblocks!\n06:20 How do you get electricity?\n06:50 What is uranium?\n07:28 How does a nuclear reaction work?\n08:05 Why is nuclear waste dangerous?\n08:40 What do we do with nuclear waste?\n09:35 How do you make electricity from nuclear waste?\n11:21 Why doesn’t the US reuse nuclear fuel?\n12:20 Is recycling waste feasible?\n13:41 What is Huge If True?\n\nCorrections:\n07:09 The number refers to the total number of nucleons (either a proton or a neutron) in the atom, not the neutrons alone. A U-235 atom contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons (an atomic mass of 235). The U-238 atom also has 92 protons but has 146 neutrons (an atomic mass of 238). I should have said these *differ* by the number of neutrons in the atom.

{"description":"Oppenheimer - Only In Theaters 7 21 23\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. \n \nThe film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. Oscar® winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award® nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar® winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar® nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\nOppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography. \n\nNolan’s films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations. \n\nSocial Handles:\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/oppenheimermovie    \nTW: https://www.twitter.com/@oppenheimerfilm  \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OppenheimerMovie \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/OppenheimerMovie/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/oppenheimermovie\nWebsite: https://www.OppenheimerMovie.com   \n#Oppenheimer","title":"Oppenheimer | New Trailer","duration":187,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230508","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYPbbksJxIg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uYPbbksJxIg/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":20662607}}

{"description":"When we heard actor Elizabeth Olsen likes In-N-Out but considers herself a burger novice, we knew we had to step in and change that. That's why host Alvin Cailan and his comedic side-kick Christian Alquiza have made it their personal mission to create the ultimate burger master class for the star of HBO Max's new series, Love & Death. Behold: A tasting menu of three custom burgers, featuring 1). An In-N-Out Oklahoma fried-onion hybrid, 2). A riff on the iconic patty melt, and 3). A surprise burger inspired by Elizabeth's all-time favorite pasta dish! We fact checked our sources. We did our research.

{"description":"HELLO FRIENDS!! Welcome to our next installment of our nordic/Scandinavian travel trip! After taking a warm bath in the Blue Lagoon in Iceland - I thought - let’s chill out a bit - literally - and head to the original Ice Hotel in Northern Sweden! Yes, this hotel is made completely out of ice and snow, and it melts and gets rebuilt every year - and yes, people actually sleep in here!! I'm very interested by **strange hotels** and after our trip to the Underwater Hotel last year, when I heard of the ICEHOTEL - I figured, we better check it out. So, after a brief moment being stuck in Iceland, we headed to the ICEHOTEL to investigate & spend the night - and hopefully not get cryogenically frozen like Walt Disney's head. What do you guys think?? Would you stay here? Where should we go next?\n\nAlso - to add on to our disclaimer in the video - \"Lapland\" is not a technically a shared region, it's a general region that spans across a few different countries! \nhttps://scandification.com/where-is-lapland/\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nMelissa Douglas\nBree von Bradsky\nAndrew Lainhart\nPhil Kinney\nElizabeth Pinotti\nIshara Mathews\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS: \n0:00 Intro\n1:56 Stuck In Iceland\n5:20 A Day in Stockholm\n6:55 Traveling to the Ice Hotel\n7:52 Other (Not Icy) Buildings at the Ice Hotel\n9:33 Finally, The Ice Hotel Itself\n10:39 Ice Hotel Room Tours\n14:02 Why does this thing exist?\n16:48 Ice Hotel 365\n18:46 Other Stuff to do at the Ice Hotel\n20:03 Eating the Ice Menu\n21:11 Our (ice) room\n22:49 How to sleep in an ice room\n24:37 Goodnight\n26:13 Good Morning\n27:47 Carve that Ice!\n28:41 Outro\n\n#travel #vlog #hotel","title":"I Spent 24 Hours In A Swedish Ice Hotel","duration":1793,"channel_id":"UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA","author":"Safiya Nygaard","date":"20230507","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfQOsKmyCNY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/KfQOsKmyCNY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1806106}}

{"description":"We built a one of a kind bike camper rv and attempted to travel 100 miles! This thing ways 500 pounds so this will not be an easy challenge. The problem is you don't ever get rest because someone has to constantly be pushing from the back as well which really tires out your legs... However it is fully functional so we can sleep overnight and everything you can do on a camping trip. Is it possible to take a road trip in a 500 lbs bike camper?? \n\nSHOP OUR MERCH HERE:\nhttps://www.bonfire.com/store/dangie-bros/\n\nFOLLOW DANGIE BROS ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIAS (@TheDangieBros):\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DangieBrosVideos/\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedangiebros/?hl=en\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL INSTAGRAMS:\n\nFollow Chris on Instagram: (@christopherryan98)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/christopherryan98/?hl=en\n\nFollow Jeff on Instagram: (@jeffufahh)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeffufahh/?hl=en","title":"Roadtrip in a Homemade Bike House!","duration":545,"channel_id":"UC495kynFX55dE0iorwV3RKQ","author":"Dangie Bros","date":"20230506","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gdzt8zgdsI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4gdzt8zgdsI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2339054}}
