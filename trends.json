Twice in a month our road has been completely washed out. This has halted progress on the American Hotel and everything else. It's been a very trying time, but if I've learned anything in the past 2 years or so, it's that the only way forward is through. So we got back after it and went about fixing the road, once again. \n\nAlong the way, I took two side trips that really inspired me and helped keep everything in perspective. I visited the graves of the 1872 Earthquake victims as well as the Burro Schmidt Tunnel. Both really helped me this week as all this was happening.

Filled with easter eggs, new characters and a lot of things that alter what happens in the books we're here to explain it all. Set before the days of the Maury show we unfortunately can't carry out a DNA test but we all know who the father is of Rhaenyras kids. Harwin Strong has only briefly appeared in the series so far and he was spotted briefly at Aegons second born day as well as in the streets of Kings Landing and now my mans gone from a knight in the streets to a night in the sheets.\n\nNow the book shouldn't be taken as gospel and though I'll talk about what happens in it, it is important to bear in mind that there are lots of second hand accounts that have been compiled by Maesters. They all differ over who took Rhaenyras Maidenhead with some saying that Daemon did it, Criston was the one and Harwin is also mentioned as well.\n\nHarwin was known as Harwin Breakbones, the strongest man in Westeros and also the heir to Harranhaal which we saw in the prologue of episode 1.\n\nIt's said Criston rejected her at one point and she ran off into the night which is where she bumped into Harwin who ended up being the one who did the deed. In the source material the pair got it on and this burned Criston who ended up becoming bitter about it. Though he knocked Rhaeynra back he was deeply in love with her and he ended up unleashing this anger at the tournaments at the wedding.","title":"HOUSE OF THE DRAGON Episode 6 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Of Thrones Easter Eggs","duration":1532,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20220926","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Veg4RXgSjVk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Veg4RXgSjVk/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":444845}}

Http://youtube.com/corridorcast\n\nTHIS EPISODE ‚ñ∫ As Ai image generation takes the art world by storm, Niko sits down to see if he can harness its power and create the first-ever narrative story illustrated entirely by a computer.\n\nA message from Niko ‚ñ∫ Hi there! If you‚Äôre reading this far, it‚Äôs probably because you want to learn more about this technology, and possibly want to run it yourself.\n\nThe easiest and simplest way to try Stable Diffusion is through their official online tool, Dream Studio - https://beta.dreamstudio.ai\n\nNow, if you want to get in on the open source movement, you can have this up and running on most modern PCs for free. However, if you‚Äôve never worked with open source projects before, there is a learning curve to get started. Don‚Äôt worry! With a little focused time you‚Äôll be up and running, and there are many of us online ready to help.\n\nThe two communities I recommend starting with:\nOfficial Stable Diffusion Discord - https://discord.gg/stablediffusion\nr/StableDiffusion - http://reddit.com/r/stablediffusion\n\nYou got questions? Start there!\n\nAt the studio we‚Äôre currently running AUTOMATIC1111‚Äôs version of Stable Diffusion. If you want to install it, here‚Äôs a guide: https://stablediffusionguides.carrd.co/#one\n\nCheck out the other guides on that site as well, for other ways to run Stable Diff. You can even run it on the could!\n\nAs for Dreambooth‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre gonna need access to some serious hardware to run it. In time I‚Äôm sure this will change, but at this moment it is very challenging. Be forewarned!\n\nHere is the official project from Google: https://dreambooth.github.io\n\nAnd this is the implementation in Stable Diffusion I recommend you try: https://github.com/JoePenna/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion\n\nI‚Äôll be honest with you- I am no ML scientist, and I can‚Äôt break down in detail how the code works. This is raw experimental stuff, and frankly most of us have no idea what we‚Äôre doing. But we‚Äôre chipping away at it! I recommend stopping by this specific discord thread if you wanna help out: https://discord.gg/thwu44bc\n\nAnd finally, all of this is possible right now because of open sharing of knowledge and collaboration.

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n00:00 Viewer discretion is advised: the rules\n00:53 searching for trash gems\n02:50 Item #1\n03:33 choosing a shelter location\n03:53 building a fire pit\n05:06 item #2\n07:08 item #3\n07:38 making a fire\n08:43 best vpn ;)\n09:54 item #4\n10:58 water purification system\n12:15 item #5‚Ä¶.re-do ;)\n13:05 building shelter\n\n14:40 item #6\n15:42 eating dry cake mix‚Ä¶\n17:32 making a natural pillow\n18:46 item #7\n19:58 item #8\n21:29 making tools out of clay\n22:37 item #9\n25:00 making a CAKE\n26:25 item #10 - last one\n27:41 the pasta dance\n32:05 the clay pot WORKED\n33:42 sleeping with bears‚Ä¶\n35:00 midnight check in‚Ä¶.NOT GOOD\n35:40 2 am, Eamon is DONE\n37:08 TBC: pt. 2 is on Eamon and Bec‚Äôs channel!\n\n\n#survivor #bushcraft #travel #travelvlog","title":"48 HOUR SURVIVAL (starting with nothing)","duration":2258,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220925","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z78Pza15RYU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z78Pza15RYU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":597217}}

{"description":"In this video I'm restoring a pair of antique German headphones. I've found these headphones at an online auction for $30 and I thought they look pretty cool for a restoration project.\nUnfortunately they didn't work anymore. I measured the coils and three of the four were broken. That fact put this little project to a whole new challenge. It required a ton of research to completely understanding every single detail of its function to remake the coils and such. After some trial and error I managed to remake the broken bobbins and rewind the coils. The tricky part was that both  coils are connected with eachother at the beginning of the windings in the core. I had to make a special jig, so I could clamp both coils when winding the second one.\nThe original paint had some kind of a structure in it. It was black matte with some kind of a hammertone pattern. Unfortunately I was not able to find such paint, so I went with regular black matte. To not loose the were fine writings and logo I only applied a very thin layer of primer and coat.\nThe Bakelite pieces just required some wet sanding and a good polish and they looked like new again. Old Bakelite might contain asbestos, that's why I wet sanded them so there won't be any sanding dust.\nI cleaned the membranes with scotch brite after a 24h bath in rust remover. To get rid of the pitting I sanded it with 240 grit sandpaper. I was already down to 0.13mm from 0.2mm thickness, but there was still pitting visible and I just sanded one side. To get the best possible sound at the end I decided to remake both membranes with new 0.2mm steel foil. To match the original membranes I also painted the center black matte.\nI nickel plated all the screws and the two brackets like they were originally. The brackets were a little bit weird, because they were two identical ones instead of pair of mirrored ones. I fixed that pretty easy by just bending the shaft on one ion the opposite direction.\nI was very lucky that the cable was in nearly perfect condition. It had absolutely no visible damge or fraying, just lost a bit of color. I just had to shorten them. Todays headphones all work with AC, these however back then worked with DC. Therefore the polarity matters. I also marked all endings of the cable with red and black threads, so did I made a red and black plastic cover for the plugs. \nIn the end I'm very happy how these headphones have turned out. The color combination of the black matte with the shiny black Backelite parts look very classy together with the shiny nickel plated parts and the crispy clean looking knurling is the cherry on top.\n\nI hope you like my work and the video.\n\nHuge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and especially to:\nAdel AlSaffar\nAlex McGeorge\nAlfonso Baz\nAlistair Moor\nAmar.k\nAnthony Eufemio\nArron Metcalf\nArthur\nBendurion\nBrenna Redpath\nChris walter\nDavid Barker\nEdward Conway\nEmbiss\nHaitham Al Zir\nisaac\njames lowe\nJean Ceppi\nJohn Shebanow\nJosh Denny\nJosh Ledford\nJosh Wasserman\nJoshua Bentley\nJoshua Scher\nKar Marsten\nLambda GPU Workstations\nLordPi\nMellissa Marcus\nMonte Gibbs\nNathaniel Carver\nNoLoneSurvivor\nPat Thrasher\nPeter Riddett\npotokslow\nSophieHDLM\nSteve Bothe\nStevenVR\nTyler Carruth\nVaushVidya\nVickie Bligh\nVince Valenti\nWill Black\nXavier Carbel\nYale Baker\nYuri Zapuchlak\nAdam Holtzclaw\nAlipasha Sadri\nAndrew Egerton\nAndrew Phillips\nArni Bjorgvinsson\nBonnie Williamson\nBrian Hoerl\nChad Bryant\nCharles Copenhaver\nCrystal Cash\nDamien Fuller-Sutherland\nDaniel Trejo\nDaniel Varga\nDave Hardware\nDavid Ebert\nDavid P Hruska\nDavid Powell\nEndless Mike\nGrant Daniel\nHaley McFadden\nHard_Boiled\nJack Curry\njake meckley\nJason Koi\nJeff Smith\nJeremy Cole\nJohan Vergeer\nJo√´l Franusic\nKen Rosso\nKevin Robinson\nKurt Gazow\nL Rlta\nLiam Rafle\nLina Machina\nMarc Cerisier\nMarc Staedelin\nMary Casella\nMellissa McConnell\nMicheal Bier\nMichael Lamp\nMossy_Forrest\nNik\nPasacal Schmikal\nPeter Cyprian\nRebecca Miller\nRegis Vincent\nRob\nRobert Galyen\nSarah Langlais\nScott Marshall\nStefan Kronander\nSteven Michalcewicz\nSuiros\nSvenja Kuckla\nThanny\nTim Holt\nTom Wallace\nTrevor Kam\nTucker Ifft\nVictoria Emmenegger\nWilliam\n\nMy camera:\nPanasonic HC-VX11\n\nIf you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

{"description":"The drama surrounding the Boston Celtics and especially their head coach Ime Udoka has been the main topic these past few days. And it culminated with the team suspending Udoka for a full season. This came as a shock to some, and it sure looks like a very steep penalty. \nSo let me explain what‚Äôs the real reason behind the suspension. What up everybody, my name is Stefan and this is Heat Check. Let‚Äôs get into it.\nShams Charania has new info on this topic that gives us a different perspective of the whole story.\nIn his latest article on the Athletic, Charania writes that Some members of the Celtics organization first became aware of the relationship in July. At that time, team leadership was led to believe by both parties that the relationship was consensual. But the woman recently accused Udoka of making unwanted comments toward her ‚Äî leading the team to launch a set of internal interviews. After which, the final decision was made.\nNow this is a new moment in this whole situation and a big one at that. This is the exact reason for why the code of conduct even exists.\nRemember the Dallas Mavericks debacle? There was a huge investigation done on Mavs office members that revealed sexual harassments, domestic violence, and all kinds of other detrimental behaviour. It ended ugly, and it even involved the owner Marc Cuban as a person who knew some of these issues but tried to come to settlements and confidentiality agreements.\nWell this is the exact scenario that the Celtics want to avoid. A case by case falloff and corrosion of the team‚Äôs culture.\nEven with having this code of conduct and these workplace guidelines, you see with this new info that they were still hesitant to implement when they found out about the affair.\nBut once there was even the slightest change of tone by the woman, accusing Udoka of making certain comments, the team saw how this could be a slippery slope and how the issue might snowball into a much bigger thing.\nThe woman could decide to sue, or go public with accusations, and her side of the story, all kinds of scenarios might develop from this. And you can see how it can become very ugly very soon. \nWith this suspension however, I feel like Boston set the bar high. The standards to which the team members will be held, and the expectations for how they should conduct themselves are nothing short of professional.\nThis is not some end of the bench guy, or an unknown team member, but rather the head coach we‚Äôre talking about. Possibly the greatest piece for their incredible turnaround and the road to the finals last year.\nIt would be very tempting for a team to forgive and forget when it comes to a prominent piece of their success. But with this move, their action is loud and clear. The franchise, and the organization comes before any single member of it.\nIt‚Äôs just unfortunate that it might be a step backwards for this team when it comes to actual basketball. This sudden coaching change for this season, along with the latest news that Robert Williams will have surgery and miss 4-6 weeks, it‚Äôs a huge blow. And suddenly the odds of them reaching the finals again have just plummeted.\nLet me know in the comments if you think that the Celtics can survive all of this. That‚Äôs it for now, subscribe and talk to you in the next one. Peace out.","title":"EXPOSED: The Real Reason For The Ime Udoka Suspension","duration":211,"channel_id":"UCmwxBk7Af9OnnloGZzp6JnQ","author":"Heat Check","date":"20220923","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgrRmuKMi30","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrRmuKMi30/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":145279}}

You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes.\n\nWhen BK falls into one of his own holes, he‚Äôs confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground‚Ä¶ and they demand answers!\n\nThe Hole Keeps Growing\n‚Ä¢ EXPLORE every character‚Äôs home, each with their own unique environment.\n‚Ä¢ MOVE the hole to swallow up their stuff, growing bigger each time.\n‚Ä¢ COMBINE objects inside for crazy effects: cook soup, breed bunnies, launch fireworks, and more.\n‚Ä¢ CATAPULT things back out of the hole. You can use it to solve puzzles...or just destroy stuff.\n‚Ä¢ DEVOUR everything. The hole won‚Äôt stop until the whole county is all gone.\n\n#EazySpeezy #DonutCounty #Speedrun","title":"Donut County speedruns are incredibly satisfying","duration":1779,"channel_id":"UCQSEAbOs6vsJfy7WN7iYaGQ","author":"EazySpeezy","date":"20220922","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63L0yiN3Ix0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/63L0yiN3Ix0/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":701031}}
