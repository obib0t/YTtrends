{"description":"Kung Fu Panda 4 - In Theaters March 8\n\nThis spring, for the first time in almost a decade, comedy icon Jack Black returns to his role as Po, the world‚Äôs most unlikely kung fu master, with a hilarious, butt-kicking new chapter in DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs beloved action-comedy franchise: Kung Fu Panda 4. \n\nAfter three death-defying adventures defeating world-class villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills, Po, the Dragon Warrior (Golden Globe nominee Jack Black), is called upon by destiny to ‚Ä¶ give it a rest already. More specifically, he‚Äôs tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace.\n\nThat poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. \n\nEven worse, there‚Äôs been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (Oscar¬Æ winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Po‚Äôs Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. \n\nSo, Po‚Äôs going to need some help. He finds it (kinda?) in the form of crafty, quick-witted thief Zhen (Golden Globe winner Awkwafina), a corsac fox who really gets under Po‚Äôs fur but whose skills will prove invaluable. In their quest to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleon‚Äôs reptilian claws, this comedic odd-couple duo will have to work together. In the process, Po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places. \n\nThe film features the voice talent of returning stars Academy Award¬Æ winner Dustin Hoffman as Kung Fu master, Shifu; James Hong (Everything Everywhere All at Once) as Po‚Äôs adoptive father, Mr. Ping; Academy Award¬Æ nominee Bryan Cranston as Po‚Äôs birth father, Li, and Emmy Award nominee Ian McShane as Tai Lung, Shifu‚Äôs former student and arch-nemesis. Oscar¬Æ winner Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All at Once) joins the ensemble as a new character, Han, the leader of the Den of Thieves. \n \nKung Fu Panda 4 is directed by Mike Mitchell (DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs Trolls, Shrek Forever After) and produced by Rebecca Huntley (DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs The Bad Guys). The film‚Äôs co-director is Stephanie Ma Stine (She-Ra and the Princesses of Power). In 2008, the Academy Award¬Æ-nominated 2008 inaugural chapter, Kung Fu Panda, became DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs highest-grossing original animated film and launched a franchise that has earned more than $1.8 billion at the global box-office.\n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/kungfupanda \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kungfupanda \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.kungfupanda.com\n#KungFuPanda","title":"KUNG FU PANDA 4 | Official Trailer","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20231213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_inKs4eeHiI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_inKs4eeHiI/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":12544134}}

{"description":"Olivia Rodrigo - all-american bitch | Vevo Official Live Performance\n\nOnly superlatives come to mind when trying to sum up Olivia Rodrigo‚Äôs last few years. Her incredibly impactful debut ballad ‚Äòdrivers license‚Äô goes hand in hand with words such as ‚Äúmost‚Äù and ‚Äúbest‚Äù: most streams on Spotify in a single day and week, Top 100 most-streamed songs on the platform, the Best Pop Solo Performance award at that year‚Äôs GRAMMYs. That the teen sensation could follow the ‚Äúdrivers license‚Äù craze with ‚Äúgood 4 u,‚Äù ‚Äúdeja vu,‚Äù and ultimately her debut album ‚ÄòSOUR‚Äô - all now equally beloved - was the first sign that the pop world had a rarified capital S Superstar on its hands. No doubt we saw that wattage up close when we shot LIFT performances with her. You can forget about that dreaded sophomore slump too. Thanks in part to her trusty producer sidekick Dan Nigro, ‚ÄòGUTS‚Äô elevates all the ingredients that really popped in ‚ÄôSOUR,‚Äô the 90s slacker rock guitar arrangements and riffs, the theater-kid earnestness, the talkative asides. There‚Äôs one key thematic difference. ‚ÄúLots of the new songs are about growing up rather than breakups,‚Äù Olivia proudly stated recently. When we linked up with her at the Million Dollar Theater in LA, not only had her wattage grown brighter, her command of the stage and camera were somehow even stronger than before. ‚Äúall-american bitch‚Äù is a perfect example. It's a blast to watch her shatter the innocent and idealized veneer presented in the cheeky jam, build it back up, and knock it down again.

This time, it has affected my eye. \n\nEach time I was exposed and had a bad reaction, I was given prednisone. It got to the point where, after I was exposed, the effects of the poison ivy wouldn‚Äôt go away after using prednisone.\n\nPeople typically take prednisone for its anti-inflammatory or immune suppressant effects. But, prednisone has side effects. \n\nPrednisone is a synthetic version of cortisol. Cortisol has benefits. It‚Äôs a hormone that helps the immune system and prepares the body for stress. But, high cortisol levels can lead to a lot of health concerns. \n\nYou don‚Äôt want to be on prednisone forever. The more you take it, the more it weakens the system. But, if you stop taking it, your symptoms may come back. So, why don't we get to the root problem? Keep in mind that once you start taking prednisone, it‚Äôs important not to come off of it too fast. Prednisone and cortisol also deplete the body of numerous vitamins and minerals. \n\nThe best ways to lower cortisol: \n1. Lower your stress (do physical work, exercise, spend more time on a hobby, and take certain nutrients)\n2. Take ashwagandha \n3. Try breathing exercises \n4. Use an HRV device to better understand your stress\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 58, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis and intermittent fasting.

Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and his stoically ever-professional captain, Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher), along with their diverse, lovable colleagues as they police the NYPD's 99th Precinct. In this final season of the series, Jake and the squad must try to balance their personal lives and their professional lives over the course of a very difficult year.\n\nRounding out the ensemble is Sgt. Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumera), who has a passion for organization and a weakness for dork dancing; Lt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), a mountain of a man whose most powerful muscle is his sweetheart; Jake's best friend and human puppy dog, Det. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio); and the incredibly secretive, tough-as-nails Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). Also part of the Nine-Nine are veteran officers Det. Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) and Det. Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker), whose only skill as police officers is their ability to make a passable pot of coffee.\n\nCreated by Emmy Award-winning writer/producers Dan Goor and Michael Schur, \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" won the 2014 Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series - Comedy or Musical and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Comedy or Musical (Samberg). Emmy winner Braugher earned four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as Capt. Holt.\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/NBCBrooklyn99\n\n#brooklynninenine","title":"A Tribute To Andre Braugher - Our Favorite Holt Moments","duration":487,"channel_id":"UCtRa82x1BwQdnpHf0Es4gcQ","author":"Brooklyn Nine-Nine","date":"20231213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib8fl7KrUC4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ib8fl7KrUC4/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1038895}}

{"description":"Ashley Pointer | December 13, 2023\n\"I grew up playing classical music and it's so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamber-like setting,\" Laufey says in her performance. Accompanied by a string quartet, the singer-songwriter's modern jazz-pop love songs soared at the Tiny Desk, the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact.\n\nLaufey's music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger, mainstream audiences coming to the genre. Her sophomore album, Bewitched, broke Spotify's all-time streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platform's history and resulted in her first Grammy nomination. She opens the set with \"From The Start,\" a bouncy, whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend, connecting Chet Baker-like scats with charming and playful lyrics.

{"description":"The Airbus A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007. When it debuted, it overtook the long reigning Boeing 747 as the world‚Äôs biggest passenger plane. It has four engines and is a full double-decker that can carry over 800 people depending on the airline.\n\nThe plane‚Äôs huge number of seats was seen as key in helping to free up the air traffic overcrowding at several big airports such as London‚Äôs Heathrow, New York‚Äôs JFK and Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare.\nBut orders for four engine aircraft began to decline alongside the arrival of more fuel-friendly planes such as Airbus‚Äôs own A350 and Boeing‚Äôs 787 Dreamliner.\n\nThe European plane maker Airbus announced an end to its A380 superjumbo program just 12 years after it first took to the skies. During the Covid-19 pandemic it was one of the most heavily impacted fleets due to its sheer size and cost to operate it, along with a near-halt to international long-haul travel. Many said it was the end for superjumbos, but the A380 has been making a comeback with several airlines pulling planes out of retirement.\n\nAirbus expects the A380 to be flying for the next two decades and is currently still being operated by 10 airlines including Emirates, Lufthansa, Etihad Airways and British Airways.\nCNBC explores how the A380 became the biggest passenger plane in the world and what the future looks like for the massive jet.\n\nChapters:\n 2:44 Development \n6:32 Commercial service\n9:53 Challenges  \n11:33 The future \n\nProduced, shot and edited by Erin Black\nAdditional Camera by Maggie Petrova\nAnimation by Gene Kim\nSupervising Producer Jeniece Pettitt\nEditorial Support by Leslie Josephs\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

{"description":"Hazel Cills | December 11, 2023\nThe last time Olivia Rodrigo performed a Tiny Desk concert, it was two years ago, in a deserted DMV office, back when pandemic precautions meant artists sadly couldn't play the real Desk. But this year, the singer-songwriter returned, bringing a handful of songs from her wildly fun sophomore album to the NPR Music office. \"It's much cooler to be here,\" Rodrigo says. \"I was saying earlier, I've never been starstruck by a room before.\"\n\nMany of the songs on GUTS, which earned a special recommendation on NPR Music's Best Albums of 2023 list, blow out Rodrigo's sound into colorful, grungy pop-rock fit for a stadium, like \"love is embarrassing,\" performed here with Rodrigo on jangly acoustic guitar. But the artist builds her set out with GUTS cuts that fit the intimate setup, like the searing \"vampire,\" her backup vocalists cooing eerily around each of her lines, or the potent ode to female jealousy, \"lacy,\" which Rodrigo explains started out as a poetry exercise in a college class. By the end of her set, she's completely alone at the piano for the sobering \"making the bed,\" and it's not difficult to see why she's one of pop's most promising rising performers.\n\nSET LIST\n\"love is embarrassing\"\n\"vampire\"\n\"lacy\"\n\"making the bed\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nOlivia Rodrigo: piano, guitar\nHayley Brownell: drums\nMoa Munoz: bass\nDaisy Spencer: guitar\nAshley Morgan: vocals\nGaba: vocals\nJulia Gartha: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Suraya Mohamed, Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Elizabeth Gillis, Maia Stern\nAudio Assistant: Valentina Rodr√≠guez S√°nchez\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Team: Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #oliviarodrigo","title":"Olivia Rodrigo: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1095,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20231211","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmh3iruf4RA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jmh3iruf4RA/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2134141}}

{"description":"Tom Sandoval, Ariana Madix, James Kennedy, Scheana Shay, Lala Kent and the rest of the cast gear up for season 11 of Vanderpump Rules. Watch the season premiere of Vanderpump Rules, January 30th at 8/7c on Bravo. \n\n‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ SUBSCRIBE: http://bravo.ly/Subscribe\n‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ WATCH FULL EPISODES NOW: https://bravo.app.link/Bravo-YT\n‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ VISIT BRAVO‚ÄôS OFFICIAL SITE: http://bravo.ly/Official\n#Bravo #PumpRules #SneakPeek #SeasonPremiere\n\nAbout Vanderpump Rules:\nAs a mentor and confidant to the group, Lisa is working to restore some peace between two feuding exes as she attempts to provide perspective. Lisa is refocusing her expertise on opening a new restaurant in Lake Tahoe and continuing her success with additional ventures in Las Vegas.   \n\nAriana‚Äôs life was turned upside down after a devastating breakup, but she‚Äôs determined to make the best of a difficult situation. Although she still shares a home with her ex, Ariana is moving on and dating a new long-distance boyfriend. While working to open the doors to her and Katie‚Äôs sandwich shop, Something About Her, Ariana is embracing the countless opportunities that have come her way.\n  \nRecently proclaimed #1 guy in the group, James‚Äô friendships within the circle are stronger than ever and his DJ career is booming. He bought a house in the Valley and is settling into suburban life with his girlfriend, Ally Lewber, along with their cat and a dog from James‚Äô past.\n  \nWith more distance from her divorce, Katie is exploring life as a single woman and dating, even if her pursuits strike too close to home for her ex-husband, Tom. A previous indiscretion comes to light and threatens to upend her and Scheana‚Äôs renewed friendship as well as her cordial post-divorce relationship with Tom.\n  \nLala is still in the midst of a challenging custody battle, but being the best mom to Ocean remains her priority. Lala explores fertility treatments and looks for a sperm donor as a single mother. She finds an unlikely connection with Tom Schwartz, forming a friendship that neither saw coming, but creating tension between her and the rest of the girls as her forgiveness for the Toms grows.\n  \nCelebrating their one-year wedding anniversary, Scheana and husband Brock are struggling to connect as they leave the honeymoon stage and settle into their life with a toddler. Scheana works on new music as a way to express herself. She finds herself straddling the lines in the sand within the group as she navigates her relationships with her longtime friends, and feuding exes, Ariana and Tom.\n  \nIn the aftermath of a scandal that changed his romantic relationships, dynamics within the group and the success of his businesses, Sandoval is working on bettering himself. In a fragile state, he focuses on repairing the foundations of his friendships. When he isn‚Äôt on the road touring with his band, Tom Sandoval and the Most Extras, he and Ariana live under the same roof ... locked in a stalemate for the house.\n  \nTom is mending a challenged friendship after taking the heat for his part in his best friend‚Äôs shocking deception. Embracing a new identity, Tom bleaches his hair, evades exclusivity with a friend-potentially-turned-girlfriend, and winds up in a surprising love triangle with a new flame and his ex-wife.\n\nCast:\nLisa Vanderpump\nAriana Madix\nJames Kennedy\nKatie Maloney\nLala Kent\nScheana Shay\nTom Schwartz\nTom Sandoval\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Subscribe to Guardian News on YouTube ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/guardianwiressub\n\nAnkaragucu‚Äôs president, Faruk Koca, struck the referee, Halil Umut Meler, at the end of their home match after Rizespor scored a 97th-minute equaliser. Koca walked on to the pitch and hit the referee when the final whistle blew in the 1-1 draw at Eryaman Stadium. The president of Turkey's football association, Mehmet Buyukeksi, condemned the event as an \"inhumane attack\" and announced an indefinite suspension to matches in all Turkish leagues.

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe‚Äôve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we‚Äôre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Splash Day for our New HH44 Catamaran\n01:08 How New Boats go from Land to Sea\n03:27 STOP!
