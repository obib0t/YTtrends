{"description":"They‚Äôre bad to the bone. Watch the #StraysMovie NSFW trailer now. In Theaters June 9th.\n\nhttps://www.strays.movie/ \n\nThey say a dog is a man‚Äôs best friend, but what if the man is a total dirtbag? In that case, it might be time for some sweet revenge, doggy style. \n\nWhen Reggie (Will Ferrell), a na√Øve, relentlessly optimistic Border Terrier, is abandoned on the mean city streets by his lowlife owner, Doug (Will Forte; The Last Man on Earth, Nebraska), Reggie is certain that his beloved owner would never leave him on purpose. \n\nBut once Reggie falls in with a fast-talking, foul-mouthed Boston Terrier named Bug (Oscar¬Æ winner Jamie Foxx), a stray who loves his freedom and believes that owners are for suckers, Reggie finally realizes he was in a toxic relationship and begins to see Doug for the heartless sleazeball that he is. \n \nDetermined to seek revenge, Reggie, Bug and Bug‚Äôs pals‚ÄîMaggie (Isla Fisher; Now You See Me, Wedding Crashers), a smart Australian Shepherd who has been sidelined by her owner‚Äôs new puppy, and Hunter (Randall Park; Always Be My Maybe, Aquaman), an anxious Great Dane who‚Äôs stressed out by his work as an emotional support animal‚Äîtogether hatch a plan and embark on an epic adventure to help Reggie find his way home ‚Ä¶ and make Doug pay by biting off the appendage he loves the most. (Hint: It‚Äôs not his foot). \n\nA subversion of the dog movies we know and love, Strays, directed by Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) and written by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal), is a hilarious, R-rated, live-action comedy about the complications of love, the importance of great friendships, and the unexpected virtues of couch humping. \n\nFeaturing a powerhouse comedic supporting cast‚Äîincluding Grammy winner Josh Gad (Beauty and the Beast), Harvey Guill√©n (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish), Emmy nominee Rob Riggle (The Hangover), Brett Gelman (Stranger Things), Jamie Demetriou (The Afterparty), and Emmy nominee Sofia Vergara (Modern Family)‚ÄîStrays is produced by Picturestart founder and CEO Erik Feig (Luckiest Girl Alive, Cha Cha Real Smooth), by Louis Leterrier (director Fast X, The Clash of the Titans), by Dan Perrault (Players, American Vandal) and by Lord Miller partners Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) and Lord Miller President of Film Aditya Sood (The Martian, Cocaine Bear). \n \nThe film is executive produced by Jessica Switch, Nikki Baida and Julia Hammer.","title":"Strays | Official Trailer [HD]","duration":147,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230208","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwOLKTbCUw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/BzwOLKTbCUw/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":215683}}

{"description":"And why the US and China are fighting over silicon in the first place.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn October 2022, the Biden administration placed a large-scale ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to China. They also implemented a series of other rules that prevents China from making these chips on their own. These chips are used in everyday technology, like our mobile phones and computers. They‚Äôre also crucial to military and intelligence systems, which is one of the main reasons they're at the center of a feud between the United States and China. \n\nMicrochips were first invented in the US in the 1950s, after which their use rapidly expanded worldwide. Since then, the supply chain for these chips has grown and spread to include countries in Europe and Asia. And while some countries have caught up to the US's edge in making these advanced chips, China still falls far behind despite multiple attempts to gain an advantage.\n\nWatch the latest episode of Vox Atlas to understand why China is losing a new cold war with the US over microchips.\n\nSources and further reading: \n\nWe found this book written by Chris Miller very helpful for understanding the history of chip development in the US and the foreign policy behind its competition and feud with China: \n\nChip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002 \n\nThis book gave us great context on China‚Äôs efforts to acquire foreign technology: \n\nChinese Industrial Espionage by Anna Puglisi\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Books-Anna-B-Puglisi/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AAnna+B.+Puglisi\n\nArticles like this by Chien-Huei Wu helped us learn more about how much the US replies on east asian countries for successful technology:\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2022/05/east-asian-firms-are-critical-to-americas-semiconductor-success/\n\nReporting by Bloomberg helped us understand major IP theft cases related to semiconductor chips: \nhttps://cset.georgetown.edu/article/engineer-who-fled-charges-of-stealing-chip-technology-in-us-now-thrives-in-china/\n\nAn excellent report for more detail:\nGregory Allen, CSIS https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Last week we received an invitation to Buckingham Palace to meet the King of England, and I got the chance to talk to him about Korea and what it means to me.\n\nMore than 20 years ago some Korean middle-schoolers went out of their way to welcome me into their friendship group. They made me feel at home and like I belonged, in a place where I had felt like an outsider.\n\n10 years ago I went out with my best mate Ollie to talk to people on the streets of London about Korea. And since then we‚Äôve had the privilege to introduce Korean culture and food to my friends, family and the world.\n\nThis was truly a surreal experience, and was an honour that we never would have received without all of you, so from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.\n\n--\n\nÏßÄÎÇú Ï£º, Ï†ÄÌù¨Îäî Î≤ÑÌÇπÏóÑ Í∂ÅÏ†ÑÏóê Ï¥àÎåÄÎ•º Î∞õÏïÑ ÏòÅÍµ≠Ïùò Íµ≠ÏôïÏùÑ ÎßåÎÇòÎµê Ïàò ÏûàÎäî ÌäπÎ≥ÑÌïú Í≤ΩÌóòÏùÑ ÌïòÍ≤å ÎêêÏñ¥Ïöî.

{"description":"Hogwarts Legacy reviewed by Travis Northup on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.\nIn nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I‚Äôve always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It‚Äôs certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn‚Äôt come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me.\n\n#HogwartsLegacy #HogwartsLegacyReview","title":"Hogwarts Legacy Review","duration":630,"channel_id":"UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw","author":"IGN","date":"20230206","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6dZxoob8CY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6dZxoob8CY/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2219649}}

One of the many things that makes living off the grid so difficult, beyond the distance, isolation and logistics of surviving in -20 degree weather, is the psychological games your mind can play when you hear sounds in the woods. And as it turns out near the end of this episode, we weren't just imagining things! We were scared half to death, and we have @talandmads to confirm it. This will make much more sense after you watch this episode! And speaking of, we either did something very right, or very wrong with the drywall. We are bracing for the comments on this one, because things looked smooth and level when we went to sleep, but a little off the next day. Did our drywall catfish us?! We love all the helpful comments from our Patreon Pack, and we read all of them, thank you! After a long week of hard work and a few setbacks, nothing like seeing some friendly faces will lift your spirits. It's good to be reminded: if you fail, try again!

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out!

{"description":"An outdated safety law may have cost hundreds of lives.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nEver since the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, a major suspected culprit for the high death toll has been that there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats on board. It‚Äôs a decision that's been dramatized as hubris on the part of the White Star Line ‚Äî but the ship actually surpassed safety standards for the time. \n\nThe Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 required the largest-class ships, those weighing over 10,000 tons, to carry at least 16 lifeboats. Even though the Titanic, which launched in 1911, weighed 45,000 tons, that minimum was the same. The Titanic carried 20 lifeboats, with a capacity for roughly half of the people on board the night the ship sank. \n\nUntil the Titanic disaster, lifeboats weren‚Äôt seen as a substitute for an entire ship. The giant liner itself, which featured 16 compartments separated by watertight bulkheads, was supposed to stay afloat even after taking on water. Then, using a brand new piece of technology ‚Äî the Marconi wireless telegraph ‚Äî signal for help from a nearby ship, using lifeboats to methodically ferry passengers off the sinking ship.\n\nThis scenario played out perfectly just a couple years before the Titanic disaster, when a ship accidentally rammed RMS Republic in 1909. The Republic sank, but nearly everyone on board was safely ferried off. The prevailing thought at the time was that disasters at sea had become a thing of the past. \n\nWhen the Titanic went down, that all changed. Just two years later, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) mandated all passenger ships carry lifeboats for everyone on board. Today, the SOLAS requirement is 125% of a ship‚Äôs capacity. \n\n\nFurther reading: \nCheck out Sam Halpern‚Äôs work analyzing the permissible flooding conditions on the Titanic: \nhttp://www.titanicology.com/FloodingByCompartment.html\n\nRead the 1909 news articles explaining the sinking of the Republic: \nhttps://www.rmsrepublic.news/\n\nDive into a wealth of Titanic research in ‚ÄúOn a Sea of Glass‚Äù by J.
