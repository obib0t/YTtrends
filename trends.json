Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You'll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories- or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you're low on funds. Jobs and missions pay well, but you'll need to use that money to maintain your truck. When you think your truck is powerful enough, and you have enough bankroll for major repairs, use your truck to complete some of the map's challenges, such as races, rock crawls, hill climbs, and very destructive long jumps.\n\nIf you're not good with mechanics, don't worry. Your truck comes with a fully illustrated service manual. The town also has a mechanic who can give inspections, or even make repairs if you have the cash.\n\n- Fully integrated stock engine and drivetrain with over 60 stock parts, a swappable V8 engine with even more parts, and lots of aftermarket parts.\n- Upgradeable parts such as EFI conversion, headers, drive gears, turbochargers, several off road tire options, and accessories.\n- Fully responsive engine and drivetrain which exhibits true-to-life performance and auditory feedback on part failure, temperature, or fluid issues.\n- Miles of off road trails and roadways.\n- Open world game with freedom to play how you want to play.\n- Off road challenges; some which are difficult, others which are nearly impossible.\n- Make money with heavy delivery missions, rescue missions, collecting junk around the map and recycling it at the junkyard. Or work for yourself by brewing moonshine, logging, mining, or pressing your luck at the pub playing Texas Hold'em.\n- Day and night cycle, requiring you maintain your food, hydration, and sleep.\n- Softbody physics.","title":"How to Be the Worst Neighbor In Existence","duration":1058,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220930","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8KmRw8610","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/J_8KmRw8610/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":1106316}}

What‚Äôs coming next? \nFrom your inventions?\nWe wonder where, where does it end?\nWho can foresee, see what will be?\n\n\n========= Historic Fact ==========\n\nFritz Haber, often referred to as the ‚Äúfather of chemical warfare‚Äù, weaponised lethal gas for the Germans during World War I. Haber is also responsible for the Haber-Bosch process,an invention that resulted in a boom in the world‚Äôs population due to a significant increase in agricultural produce.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren. \n\nThe lyric video was produced by Dime Stamenov from  https://instagoodpromotion.wixsite.com/instapromotion\n\n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.","title":"SABATON - Father (Official Lyric Video)","duration":275,"channel_id":"UCjQhd1APsd5NQhiVZV7GYzg","author":"Sabaton","date":"20220930","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxkeOkaVRLo","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DxkeOkaVRLo/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":519780}}

{"description":"Halloween Ends - The Final Trailer\nIn theaters and streaming only on Peacock October 14\n\nThis is Laurie Strode‚Äôs last stand. \n\nAfter 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive. \n\nIcon Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the last time as Laurie Strode, horror‚Äôs first ‚Äúfinal girl‚Äù and the role that launched Curtis‚Äô career. Curtis has portrayed Laurie for more than four decades now, one of the longest actor-character pairings in cinema history. When the franchise relaunched in 2018, Halloween shattered box office records, becoming the franchise‚Äôs highest-grossing chapter and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a horror film starring a woman. \n\nFour years after the events of last year‚Äôs Halloween Kills, Laurie is living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and is finishing writing her memoir. Michael Myers hasn‚Äôt been seen since. Laurie, after allowing the specter of Michael to determine and drive her reality for decades, has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell; The Hardy Boys, Virgin River), is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can‚Äôt control, once and for all. \n\nHalloween Ends co-stars returning cast Will Patton as Officer Frank Hawkins, Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and James Jude Courtney as The Shape.  \n\nFrom the creative team that relaunched the franchise with 2018‚Äôs Halloween and Halloween Kills, the film is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Paul Brad Logan (Manglehorn), Chris Bernier (The Driver series), Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.

After seeing \"Slave For You,\" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,‚Äù On the creative direction, Muino continued, \"Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.\"\n\nProd Co: UnderWonder Content\nProducers: Robert Katz, Frank Borin, Ivana Borin \nDirector: Tanu Muino\n\nWatch more Elton videos: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WatchMore\nSubscribe to Elton channel: http://bit.ly/EltonYTSubscribe \n\nFollow Elton John on...\nFacebook: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/facebookYT \nTwitter: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/twitterYT \nInstagram: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/instaYT \nOfficial Website: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WebsiteOfficial \nJoin the Rocket Club newsletter: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/RocketClub \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/EltonJohn","title":"Elton John, Britney Spears - Hold Me Closer (Official Video)","duration":205,"channel_id":"UCI8Ry7NdFNLel-S8dWU7mDA","author":"EltonJohnVEVO","date":"20220927","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qExVlz3zb0k","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/hqdefault.jpg?v=6332f93b","content":{"View count":1123163}}

A player‚Äôs creativity and ingenuity are the key to thriving on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\nReshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\n\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish.

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

Filled with easter eggs, new characters and a lot of things that alter what happens in the books we're here to explain it all. Set before the days of the Maury show we unfortunately can't carry out a DNA test but we all know who the father is of Rhaenyras kids. Harwin Strong has only briefly appeared in the series so far and he was spotted briefly at Aegons second born day as well as in the streets of Kings Landing and now my mans gone from a knight in the streets to a night in the sheets.\n\nNow the book shouldn't be taken as gospel and though I'll talk about what happens in it, it is important to bear in mind that there are lots of second hand accounts that have been compiled by Maesters. They all differ over who took Rhaenyras Maidenhead with some saying that Daemon did it, Criston was the one and Harwin is also mentioned as well.\n\nHarwin was known as Harwin Breakbones, the strongest man in Westeros and also the heir to Harranhaal which we saw in the prologue of episode 1.\n\nIt's said Criston rejected her at one point and she ran off into the night which is where she bumped into Harwin who ended up being the one who did the deed. In the source material the pair got it on and this burned Criston who ended up becoming bitter about it.

Avoid Paying Full Price, Get Capital One Shopping for Free ‚ñ∫ https://capitaloneshopping.com/corridorcrew\nJoin OUR WEBSITE ‚ñ∫ https://www.corridordigital.com/signup\n\nIf you want to get some way more in-depth conversation about these tools and how we‚Äôre using AI, Check out the Corridor podcast. Http://youtube.com/corridorcast\n\nTHIS EPISODE ‚ñ∫ As Ai image generation takes the art world by storm, Niko sits down to see if he can harness its power and create the first-ever narrative story illustrated entirely by a computer.\n\nA message from Niko ‚ñ∫ Hi there! If you‚Äôre reading this far, it‚Äôs probably because you want to learn more about this technology, and possibly want to run it yourself.\n\nThe easiest and simplest way to try Stable Diffusion is through their official online tool, Dream Studio - https://beta.dreamstudio.ai\n\nNow, if you want to get in on the open source movement, you can have this up and running on most modern PCs for free. However, if you‚Äôve never worked with open source projects before, there is a learning curve to get started. Don‚Äôt worry! With a little focused time you‚Äôll be up and running, and there are many of us online ready to help.\n\nThe two communities I recommend starting with:\nOfficial Stable Diffusion Discord - https://discord.gg/stablediffusion\nr/StableDiffusion - http://reddit.com/r/stablediffusion\n\nYou got questions? Start there!\n\nAt the studio we‚Äôre currently running AUTOMATIC1111‚Äôs version of Stable Diffusion. If you want to install it, here‚Äôs a guide: https://stablediffusionguides.carrd.co/#one\n\nCheck out the other guides on that site as well, for other ways to run Stable Diff. You can even run it on the could!\n\nAs for Dreambooth‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre gonna need access to some serious hardware to run it. In time I‚Äôm sure this will change, but at this moment it is very challenging. Be forewarned!\n\nHere is the official project from Google: https://dreambooth.github.io\n\nAnd this is the implementation in Stable Diffusion I recommend you try: https://github.com/JoePenna/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion\n\nI‚Äôll be honest with you- I am no ML scientist, and I can‚Äôt break down in detail how the code works. This is raw experimental stuff, and frankly most of us have no idea what we‚Äôre doing. But we‚Äôre chipping away at it!
