{"description":"Nuclear-weapons physicist Greg Spriggs rates seven nuclear-explosion scenes in movies.\n\nHe analyzes the portrayal of nuclear detonations and their effects in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” (2008), starring Harrison Ford; “Broken Arrow” (1996), starring John Travolta; Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012), starring Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, and Anne Hathaway; and Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” (1964). He also comments on what a nuclear explosion in outer space would really look like in comparison to Marvel’s “The Avengers” (2012), starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson; and Michael Bay’s “Armageddon” (1998), starring Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, and Liv Tyler. He breaks down the underwater detonation seen in “American Assassin” (2017), starring Michael Keaton. And he explains how accurate Christopher Nolan’s recreation of the construction of the first atomic bomb in Los Alamos and the subsequent Trinity test was in \"Oppenheimer” (2023), starring Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh.\n\nSpriggs has been a nuclear-weapons physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for 20 years. He worked on a special project where he scanned, reanalyzed, and declassified old nuclear test films.\n\nYou can find more information about the Livermore National Laboratory at: www.llnl.gov\n\nThese movies show simulations of the effects of using nuclear weapons near the public. To date, the 1945 atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the only instances of nuclear weapons being detonated as an act of war.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

{"description":"The death toll from the wildfires in Maui now stands at 80, and about a thousand people remain missing. The fire is now mostly contained and some survivors are returning to find their community in ruins. Global’s Neetu Garcha is in Maui and has been speaking with evacuees including a Canadian school principal.\n\nResidents say the wildfires hit without warning and some are now demanding to know why their large seaside community was caught off guard. As Reggie Cecchini explains, experts say this fire offers lessons for the future. \n\nAt least six asylum seekers have been killed after their boat sank in the English Channel. It’s the latest in a string of similar tragedies. More than 1,000 migrants have tried to make the journey to the UK by boat in just the last two days. As Touria Izri reports, those who survived the journey, face tough, new immigration measures.\n\nWith no end in sight to the war in Ukraine, tensions are rising in neighbouring Poland – particularly along its border with Belarus. The Polish government claims Belarussian military helicopters entered its airspace at the beginning of the month. In response, Poland’s government ordered 10,000 troops to the border to bolster defences – while on the other side, mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner group are reportedly training Belarussian forces. Those military maneuvers are making NATO nations nervous. Tonight, Crystal Goomansingh looks at the work underway to keep Poland safe.\n\nArtificial Intelligence just might join you on your next vacation. Tourism Jasper in Alberta’s rocky mountains is now using AI in hopes of making the destination more popular. And they’re not alone- as Heather Yourex-West explains, applications like ChatGPT and Oliver A.I. are taking the industry by storm.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/national/program/global-national\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #globalnational","title":"Global National: Aug. 12, 2023 | How Maui was caught off guard by catastrophic wildfires","duration":1224,"channel_id":"UChLtXXpo4Ge1ReTEboVvTDg","author":"Global News","date":"20230813","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uvpq0jkgA","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/U2Uvpq0jkgA/hqdefault.webp?v=64d82cc3","content":{"View count":588394}}

{"description":"Watch the full interview now as a VladTV Youtube Member - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA/join\n\nPart 9: https://youtu.be/PP97f3Anzis\nPart 11: https://youtu.be/4vyn2gY_w1E\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/Ba-wBLtSIss\n--------\nIn this clip, Boosie revealed his financial strategies, owning multiple cars and flipping them when he decides to or when circumstances require. This arose in a discussion about Kodak Black, who was given a Rolls-Royce Phantom for contributing a verse to a song. When Vlad questioned the wisdom of owning multiple cars, Boosie defended the practice claiming they are an investment and a source of additional income if needed. In support of this practice, Boosie referred to a period when he was incarcerated and paid his bond by selling one of his cars. Vlad echoed Boosie’s sentiment, adding that smart financial habits can only be learned through experience. Both agreed that material possessions are not worth as much as personal freedom and should not be viewed as a permanent asset.","title":"Boosie on Kodak Black Clowning Him for Selling Rolls Royce to Pay for Legal Fees (Part 10)","duration":287,"channel_id":"UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA","author":"djvlad","date":"20230811","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWYD9av1XcY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dWYD9av1XcY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":908057}}
