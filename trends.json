{"description":"For the second straight year, the San Francisco 49ers bounced the Dallas Cowboys from the playoffs with a 19-12 final score. Dak Prescott threw two interceptions in the first half and finished with just over 200 passing yards and one touchdown. The Cowboys last play, with Ezekiel Elliott snapping the ball to Dak, was shut down when KaVontae Turpin was immediately tackled after hauling in the short pass. Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe discuss the biggest reason America's Team came up short once again.\n\n#Undisputed #NFL #Cowboys\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫ Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n‚ñ∂ First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n‚ñ∂ The Herd with Colin Cowherd‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n‚ñ∫ SPEAK's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n‚ñ∫ FOX Bet Live‚Äôs YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n‚ñ∫ Club Shay Shay‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n‚ñ∫ The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n‚ñ∫ What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n‚ñ∂ The Carton Show‚Äôs YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\nFollow UNDISPUTED on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@undisputedonfs1?lang=en\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.

The series has had two really good episodes back to back and as a big fan of the game I've loved watching these first two entries. They do change some things up though and throughout the video we're gonna be going over the easter eggs, game differences and also giving our thoughts on the series so far.\n\nHuge thank you to everyone who checked out our video last week and like that one we're gonna be saving the more spoilery easter eggs until the end so that people who haven't played the game can enjoy all the twists and turns that come up in the show. I'll give you a heads up before we hit that and we start the episode off in Jakarta all the way back in 2003.\n\nIf you cast your mind back to last week then you may remember that they did an announcement over the radio that talked about the city and how something strange was going on there. Here we see it playing out with the outbreak of the infection being studied by a doctor. This wasn't in the game and I like how the series is slowly filling in the backstory of the virus. Both the beginning of last episode and this one had completely new bits in them and it's possible that we might even get a new story slotted in at the opening of each entry that gives us way more details on the infection than what we ever got in the game.\n\nWhen the title cards first shown we can see this is taking place on September 24th 2003 dating it two days before the outbreak. This of course shows how fast the virus spread and in the game we learned it was through products contain flour and yeast which we'll talk more about in just a bit. Huge shoutouts to Dyanmic Smurf on our last video for pointing out that 2003 was potentially chosen because it was one of the hottest years on record which a record breaking heat wave happening that killed 20,000 people.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 2 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":1737,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230123","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crDFaekrmLE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/crDFaekrmLE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":397796}}

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•","title":"33 Hours in the World's Best First Class","duration":1536,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20230121","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6hpzfYV2fU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F6hpzfYV2fU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1004043}}

For me, this moment came during the climax of the Pete Davidson film ‚ÄúThe King of Staten Island,‚Äù where his most important line was impossible to understand. \n\nI had to rewind three times ‚Äî and eventually put subtitles on ‚Äî to finally pick up what he was saying.\n\nThis experience isn‚Äôt unique ‚Äî gather enough people together and you can generally separate them into two categories: People who use subtitles, and people who don‚Äôt. And according to a not-so-scientific YouTube poll we ran on our Community tab, the latter category is an endangered species ‚Äî 57% of you said you always use subtitles, while just 12% of you said you generally don‚Äôt.\n \nBut why do so many of us feel that we need subtitles to understand the dialogue in the things we watch?\n\nThe answer to that question is complex ‚Äì and we get straight to the bottom of it in this explainer, with the help of dialogue editor Austin Olivia Kendrick.\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Use my code PAOLO15 at https://partner.bokksu.com/paolo15  to get $15 off your first Bokksu Japanese snack box!\n\nThis is a Japan behind the counter food tour of a local Japanese bento shop. For more than 40 years, Bento Kawano has been making delicious Japanese handmade bento lunches at the affordable price of 600yen. At this value and quality it‚Äôs no surprise everyday that the customer lunch lines wrap around the entire block.  One important things about this Japanese bento shop is that they must be extra careful about food safety.  Since Bentos are designed to be able to sit on the shelf for several hours without refrigeration, the food must always be fully cooked. Run by Japanese food craftsman, Inoue san, he changes the menu everyday so his customers have something to look forward to.  He particularly enjoys analyzing the performance of his previous bentos and creating new ones to see how popular it will be, but ultimately he says that whatever bento he serves, he creates each one as if he‚Äôll be sharing it with his loved ones. Interestingly, this Tokyo bento shop runs 4 rice cookers simultaneously throughout the entire day to keep up with the demand using a special hitomebore rice from Miyagi prefecture known for its exquisite taste especially when its cooled down.  Even the rice at the shop was specifically selected by Inoue san.  I hope you enjoy this Tokyo Hidden gem bento shop.   \n\nBento Kawano\n- https://goo.gl/maps/LUWZtAGDey1msVFw6\n- https://www.genkigohan.com/\n\nWatch more Japan Behind the Counter videos here\n- https://tokyozebra.com/btc\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n___ Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ___\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?

I also may or may not still live with my mom so I feel guilty gaming while at home. That's why I decided to build a secret gaming room under the stairs in a hidden closet so that I can play all the games I want in peace and quiet. So my mom didn‚Äôt find out about this project, I sent her and my sister to Paris for the week. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love my new gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one! \nComment ‚ÄúI want a secret gaming room!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from my Wife, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from My Family, But Secret Hidden Gaming Room Inside a Couch, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My House *PS5*, But Little Girl Finds A Secret Room In Her House That Leads Into An Even Wilder Surprise, But I Built a Secret Room in Public, But I Turned an Old Dumpster into an Epic Secret Room, But INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS Hidden Rooms and Secret Furniture , But I Built a Secret Room, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My New House, But Hidden Entrance INSIDE Stairs To DREAM Gaming Room, But I Found The ULTIMATE HIDDEN GAMING ROOM In My New House or any other video like JStu, FrenchieFries, Jake Carlini, Ben Azelart, AllWeDoIsFun, Zealous, Tiana Wilson, Dangie Bros, Drew Dirksen, Carter Sharer, MARKO, Interesting & Creative Designs, Chris & Emily, Unspeakable, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

This statement was inspired by the observation that so many aspects of the physical world seem to be describable and predictable by mathematical equations to incredible precision especially as quantum phenomena. But quantum phenomena have no subjective qualities and have questionable physicality. They seem to be completely describable by only numbers, and their behavior precisely defined by equations.

{"description":"Nicholaus Joseph Williams, better known by his stage name Trinidad James is a Trinidadian-American rapper. In 2012, he signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. The label dropped him in 2014 when he failed to release an album, although he continues to release music as an independent artist and is signed to Artist Publishing Group for songwriting.  \n\nIn this interview Marco starts off by asking who does Trinidad want to be? The interview starts very awkwardly as Trinidad has a bear mask on. Trinidad challenges Marco and says Marco brought him on the show to exploit him. The tables are turned as Trinidad seems to be trolling Marco and has him on his toes. Marco asks Trinidad to remove his mask and Trinidad asks Marco to tie his tie and in exchange Trinidad takes the tie and puts it on. Trinidad takes off his mask to reveal his face with one eyed made up. Marco gets into the interview asking why Trinidad hasn‚Äôt made any new music. Trinidad reveals that he wanted to know what the business of entertainment was about. Trinidad talks about his relationships with record labels. Trinidad goes deeper into relationships. Trinidad then goes into his various products and the meaning behind them. Trinidad asks Marco what he thinks about him. Trinidad and Marco go back and forth about the word ugly. The conversation speeds up and the two go back and forth. Marco‚Äôs phone goes off and Marco blames it on Matt the Producer. Matt the Producer enters and Trinidad and Matt get into a discussion that gets a little tense. Trinidad and Marco continue the interview. Marco asks Trinidad about his hair. Matt the Producer tells Trinidad to get out of Marco‚Äôs creative space. A lady enters from the backstage and Trinidad yells at the lady and Marco invites her on stage. She awkwardly exits and Marco attempts to end the interview as Marco exits while talking to Matt the Producer and the mics are hot. Trinidad throws his chair and goes under the ladder and Matt the Producer holds exception.\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n \nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @mattablespromotions\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @Breakbeatmedia @FunnyMarco\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube page, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Trinidad James Talks Kanye, TIG, Def Jam, Painted Nails, Stage Fight","duration":1454,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20230118","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNfPcgFtVc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NRNfPcgFtVc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":696707}}
