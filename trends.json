{"description":"Watch the Official Trailer for #TheRingsOfPower now. Join us in Middle-earth on September 2.\n\nPrime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien‚Äôs pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N√∫menor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power - Official Trailer | Prime Video","duration":160,"channel_id":"UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ","author":"Prime Video","date":"20220823","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8UAUAuKNcU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8UAUAuKNcU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":6908333}}

{"description":"Funny Marco welcomes William Ray Norwood Jr. known professionally as Ray J, an American singer, actor, and television personality. Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Carson, California, he is the younger brother of recording artist and actress Brandy Norwood and the first cousin of rapper Snoop Dogg.\n\nMarco gets into the interview with Ray J and it starts off very spirited as Ray J says he wakes up mic‚Äôd up and says let‚Äôs start with the product and does a shameless plug about Raycon. Not to be upstaged, Marco sells Ray J on the idea of pitching his product to him. Marco then asks Ray J about the integrity of some of his products which Ray J explains. Marco then sets up Ray J talking about his song ‚ÄúOne Wish‚Äù and the contradiction of it. Ray J replies by saying Marco exposed him for being a hypocrite. Marco then asks Ray J if he is a member of B2K in return Ray J details the story of how B2K tried to recruit him and how he declined after they didn‚Äôt want to change the name to Ray2K and he formed the group RSVP. Marco then challenges Ray J to a staring contest and Ray J is keen to the tricks and claims to be himathy or him and her. The random questions continue as Ray J says his shirt is sweaty and changes his shirt and says he just shaved his chest hair. As he is getting re-mic‚Äôd Ray J yells he only does one podcast a year and unashamedly plugs all his products. As Ray J plugs his products Marco asks about the products and then Ray J offers Marco a podcast for which Marco challenges Ray J for answering his phone and Ray J holds exception. Ray J pairs his phone while in the interview. While conducting the interview Ray J prays openly and Marco tries to center the interview. Ray J continues to expound on his products and the name Ray J. Marco then asks about Justin Bieber and Ray J elaborates on how the conversation went. Marco replies by saying the producer revealed that the Justin Bieber conversation never happened. Ray J vehemently expounds that the story did happen and there is no beef with Justin Bieber. \n\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries  IG @therealdavemays @igobybrettj\n\nDirector: Matt Ables IG @mattablespromotions\n\nDirector of Photography: Rashid ‚ÄúCruz‚Äù Terry/Blaqk Noyze Produktionz\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n\nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco \n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Ray J Talks Justin Bieber Beef,  Raycon Earbuds, B2K, RSVP Group, Shaves Chest Hair","duration":1385,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20220823","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zxhBau3IU8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zxhBau3IU8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":392292}}

{"description":"Demi Lovato - 29 (Official Live Performance) \n\nDemi Lovato‚Äôs ‚ÄòHOLY FVCK‚Äô is a pure distillation of the superstar‚Äôs creative ethos: they‚Äôve spent the bulk of their career emphasizing honesty, and their eighth studio album walks the same path. It arrives as the incredibly successful pop singer turns the page on their twenties and launches into their thirties. So it makes sense they would turn to a new sound, too. ‚ÄòHOLY FVCK‚Äô is a rock album. The genre choice makes sense considering Demi‚Äôs wrestling with some of life‚Äôs overwhelming challenges on it. At 15 years old, Demi said that metal music fascinated them. Armed with well-earned creative freedom, they‚Äôve now carved a fertile space to explore unfiltered passion. ‚Äò29‚Äô - a raw interrogation of men who prey on younger women - has kicked off a social media conversation for others to share similar experiences. It‚Äôs the right place to begin our collab with Demi, and we can‚Äôt wait to share more.\n\nWatch Demi Lovato videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9tY0BWXOZFuEeM3kgjdncT6sm6_MjY5_\n\nFollow Demi Lovato \nhttps://www.instagram.com/ddlovato/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddlovato\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@ddlovato?lang=en\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DemiLovato\n\nFollow Vevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\n\nDirector: Micah Bickham\nCreative Director: Chris Pereira\nDirector of Photography: Nyk Allen\nSenior Line Producer: Jen Bates\nLine Producer: Maddy Schmidt\nSenior Producer: Luis Santos\nProducer, Contrast Films: Cole Brian\nProducer, Contrast Films: Haley Sliger\nAssociate Producer, Contrast Films: Cole Emery\n\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nArt Director: Daniel Erb\nArt Dept.

The new HBO Show is packed with easter eggs, callbacks and a lot of big characters that we're gonna be analysing in this video.\n\nThe entire series is based on the final third part of Fire And Blood which tells the tale of the Targaryen lineage all duking it out to take their place on the Iron Throne. As we know come Game Of Thrones, the entire House was left almost extinct and this series will be talking about how the house of cards came crashing down.\n\nBeginning at Chapter 12's Heirs Of The Dragon, the original work recounts all the ins and outs of the family tree and it basically gives the idea - if you want to be happy living a kings life, never make a pretty neice your wife.\n\nNow whether you've read it or not doesn't really matter as this breakdown will be covering it all and after becoming an expert on it last night...what did no one else do the reading? I'm here to give you the ins and outs on every single character. Because of this there might be some spoilers but I promise you that I'll not give away any of the big twists or deaths in this video, I just wanna really use the book to add some insight to the characters.\n\nIf you've read it then you'll know that it mores like a text book rather than being a story and because of this it's a bit of a slog to get through.\n\nThere's massive pages that basically just list character names, talk about them for a bit and then that's it. However it actually gives the series a massive advantage as it means that they can pick certain sections and expand on them massively. They have a few plot points that they have to stick to but beyond that they can go wild with it and it leads to this being such a good first episode.\n\nThis show takes place roughly 172 years before the death of the Mad King and the birth of Daenerys.\n\nMusic By - Steesh\n‚ñ∫ Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n‚ñ∫ Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n‚ñ∫ Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n‚ñ∫ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"HOUSE OF THE DRAGON Episode 1 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review & Game Of Thrones Easter Eggs","duration":1245,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20220822","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcN_XnTIKVE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wcN_XnTIKVE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":461154}}

{"description":"In Episode 204 of Mike Finnegan's Garage we hang out at Motor Trend's Roadkill Nights event, which is powered by Dodge. The event is unique because the city of Pontiac, Michigan, allows Roadkill to hold street legal drag racing right on Woodward ave. Newbern and I drove the Roadkill ramp truck there while hauling precious cargo as part of a really cool upcoming episode of Roadkill, which you can see of Motor Trend Plus streaming app. Rather than drive all the way back home to Georgia with an empty ramp truck, we decided to buy a really rusty and slightly butchered pro street 1970 Dodge Charger. The car is a mess but I have a vision and a few used speed parts that will someday go on this car. In the meantime, enjoy the trip and the fun of celebrating Mike Cotten's new car that he bought at RKN as well! \nWant to help support this channel?

{"description":"Rents in New York City are at an all-time high. The median asking rent in Manhattan reached $4,100 in June 2022. CNBC Make It spoke to three New Yorkers whose rents increased up to $2,100 a month.\n\nBut are New Yorkers willing to pay up? One challenge for renters is the requirement that they earn 40 times the rent when applying for an apartment. With the median asking rent in Manhattan around $4,000, that means the minimum income to qualify for an apartment at that price is $160,000. The median household income in New York City is $67,000. \n\nCorrection (Aug. 23rd, 2022): At 01:46 the video misidentified that Thelma Annan is 32 years old.

We discovered the world of ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a ‚Äúone year‚Äù trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé \n\n #northpole #travel #travelvlog #arcticcruise\n\n0:00 2 week cruise to the NORTH POLE?!\n0:38 Flying to the northernmost city in the world\n2:01 Full tour of our luxury ice breaker ship!\n5:47 Deck 5: where things get interesting\n6:46 Why we love Athletic Greens\n7:58 First sight of ICE\n10:40 Restaurant #1\n11:14 Deck 6: Helicopter pad\n13:00 Deck 7: Luxury Duplex Suite\n13:25 The Bridge\n14:20 The Science Lab\n15:25 Deck 9: The Spa\n16:25 Fitness Center\n17:08 The Main Lounge\n18:18 Restraunt #2\n18:50 Outdoor heated pool\n20:05 Gala evening\n21:34 Midnight sun!!!","title":"WE BOARDED A CRUISE TO THE NORTH POLE (Full Ship Tour)","duration":1399,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220820","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb4cCdLiuSg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kb4cCdLiuSg/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":1123252}}

It‚Äôs why in just one year‚Äôs time, he‚Äôs already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80‚Äôs hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song ‚ÄúNever Comin‚Äô Home‚Äù amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, ‚ÄúFall In Love‚Äù, ‚ÄúRock and A  Hard Place‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWhere It Ends‚Äù. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #WhereItEnds #LyricVideo","title":"Bailey Zimmerman - Where It Ends (Lyric Video)","duration":180,"channel_id":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ","author":"Bailey Zimmerman","date":"20220819","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7PHEPmdT1w","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/C7PHEPmdT1w/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":877096}}
