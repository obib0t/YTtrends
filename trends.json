{"description":"Today, I'm getting back surgery to remove a large tumor near my tailbone. It'll be a difficult procedure as the tumor is inside the spinal column and is surrounded by many nerves. Surgeons will have to make it through multiple bones to get in there and remove as much of it as possible. We then have to wait for biopsy results to figure out how to handle all the remaining tumors (I have a total of eight in my spine). It is looking most like I'll be needing radiation therapy as well as chemotherapy. \n\nThey believe what I have is something called Myxopapillary Ependymoma (MEPN). From what I'm researching online, it seems about one in a million people get this. It seems to be growing from the central nervous system out of the spinal cord rather than the brain, in my case. \n\nOver the last 18 months or longer, I've been experiencing an incredible amount of pain in my tailbone, hamstrings, calve muscles, lower back, and gluteus muscles. It is particularly painful when trying to do physical activity such as jumping, running, jogging, and even walking. It feels like a knife is being stabbed up into my tailbone area. So, it's been pretty painful filming my YouTube videos for a while now. This is why I haven't been doing as many martial arts and other fun and crazy physical challenges lately. Hopefully, after this surgery I'll be able to get back to normal life and doing all the fun things I used to do.\n\nThanks to all of you who have been super supportive and positive throughout this. I really appreciate it. Also, thank you to everybody at Keck Medicine at USC in Los Angeles, CA. Every single person I spent time with, surgeons, nurses, physical therapists, doctors, MRI technicians, etc... everybody was super positive and just had a really good attitude despite having a very difficult job. \n\n\n‚ñ∂ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n‚ñ∂ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n‚ñ∂ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n‚ñ∂ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.

Be wary when traveling on foot, or switching the track's direction; Charles might be waiting for you.\nUpgrade your train to fit your needs.\n\nGo looting or complete missions to find \"Scraps\", which can be used to turn your train into a death machine on wheels.\nGet help from the townspeople.\n\nHelp out the settlers in return for high powered weapons, and other items vital to Charles' destruction.\nFight Charles to the death.\n\nComplete the main questline, and summon Charles to a mortal duel. If you‚Äôve gained enough strength, firepower, and skill, Charles may finally meet his match.\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain.

{"description":"Jason Cammisa got the exclusive first test, strapped on his equipment, and broke the record: the Lucid Air Sapphire is the world's quickest-accelerating production car.\n\nWith a staggering quarter-mile performance of 9.1 seconds at 156 mph, this 1200+ horsepower 3-motor Air beat out the reigning champion, the triple-motor, 1020-hp Tesla Model S Plaid, which runs the 1/4-mile in 9.3 seconds at 152 mph.\n\nThe cars are \"tied\" at 2.1 seconds 0-60, though some trivia: the Lucid Air Sapphire gets to 60 mph 0.03 seconds before the Tesla Model S Plaid.\n\nWe weren't satisfied with just that race, so we also brought along the fastest-accelerating gas-powered production car, the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport. This is the 1479-hp (1500-PS) Chiron with shortened gear ratios, grippy Michelin Cup 2R tires, a fixed rear wing, and weight-reduction measures. \n\nEven despite these hyper-aggressive Michelins' distaste for cold tarmac, the Chiron ripped off a 2.3-second, four-wheel-burnout launch from 0-to-60 mph, and then continued on to a 9.3-second, 156-mph quarter-mile performance. That is a tenth quicker to 60 mph than the \"regular\" Chiron has managed, and a tenth quicker through the quarter, too. That's an internal-combustion production-car 1/4-mile record for the Chiron Pur Sport ‚Äî and we suspect that, in warmer conditions, this Pur Sport would be even quicker! \n\nThat's not the case with the 210-hp Ducati Panigale V4 SP2, one of the quickest superbikes in the world. It had no traction issues as MotoAmerica Supersport champion rider Josh Herrin cracked the throttle wide open, dumped the dry clutch, and ripped off a stupefying 9.3-second, 157-mph run through the quarter-mile.\n\nThis beat our last outing with the same Panigale, when it handily dusted a 2023 C8 Corvette Z06. This time, Ducati softened the suspension and dropped the fork; Josh sacrificed the clutch and kept the wheelie at bay. It's safe to say this is the limit for the SP2 ‚Äî except that Ducati offers a factory Akrapovic exhaust and tune that boost horsepower. We'd love to come back and try that again!\n\nBut for the moment, it's clear: among production cars with four wheels, the Lucid Air Sapphire is now the acceleration king, with the Chiron Pur Sport in second place. In one video, Tesla went from first to third.\n\nMay the fight continue.\n\nThis episode of Ultimate Drag Race Replay is brought to you by WeatherTech: https://www.weathertech.com/?utm_source=hagerty&utm_medium=web_visit&utm_campaign=Ultimate_Drag_Race_Replay\n\n\n===\n\n0:00 Introducing Lucid Air Sapphire, Tesla Model S Plaid, Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport, and the Ducati Panigale V4 SP2\n0:56 German 155-mph Autobahn Gentleman's Agreement - within 1/4 mile\n1:29 Tesla Model S Plaid vs E39 M5\n2:04 Lucid Air Sapphire Prototype\n2:30 Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport\n3:13 Main Event: Drag Race Sapphire vs Plaid vs Chiron!\n3:55 Walkback: Sapphire Drag Race explanation\n4:18 Why is Sapphire so much quicker than Air Dream Edition?\n5:05 Tesla Plaid in Last Place\n5:49 Bugatti Chiron Launch Control is violent\n6:00 EV vs ICE traction control: The 1000-Hz advantage\n7:07 Josh Herrin in the Ducati Panigale V4 SP2\n7:35 Bonus Race: Ducati Panigale V4 SP2 vs Lucid Air Sapphire\n8:24 The Ducati's quarter-mile-long wheelie\n9:03 Overall Drag Race Results ‚Äî Rimac & Bugatti join forces\n\n==\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

This video had lots of ups and downs, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to North Carolina to surprise MrBeast. His reaction were incredible!

{"description":"Welcome to what could be our most exciting review EVER! \n\nMat‚Äôs got his hands on the McMurtry Sp√©irling, and he‚Äôs about to find out if it can back up its claim of being the quickest accelerating road car ever made! \n\nNow before he even gets behind the wheel, you need to know that the McMurtry comes with a reputation! It's claimed the record as being the fastest car to complete the Goodwood Festival of Speed Hillclimb - beating an F1 car to the title by two whole seconds!\n\nBut what makes this lightning-fast single-seater so special? Well, it comes with an incredible fan system that helps to generate 2,000kg of downforce! This means the McMurtry is not only super quick off the line, but it can take corners at speed with ease. \n\nIn terms of power output, it has two electric motors that produce 1,000hp. Now you may not think that‚Äôs too impressive, given EVs such as the Rimac Nevera come with almost 2,000hp. However, whereas the Nevera weighs over 2 tonnes, the McMurtry Sp√©irling weighs less than one tonne!! \n\nNow, of course, all that power and performance doesn‚Äôt come cheap, costing just under ¬£2,000,000. But if the car can break records as it claims, then it‚Äôs got to be worth it, right? \n\nAll we know is, this is one review you don‚Äôt want to miss! Will Mat go faster than he‚Äôs ever been before? And more importantly, will he break some records?!

{"description":"France and Morocco faced off in the semifinals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. France was looking to advance to the final for the second straight World Cup and Morocco was striving to become the first African nation to make a World Cup final. France got started early as a Kylian Mbapp√© shot on goal was rebounded by Theo Hern√°ndez who scored. Morocco almost tied it up when Jawad El Yamiq's bicycle kick ALMOST goes in but France's Hugo Lloris denied it. The second half was slow but France would get on the board again after Randal Kolo Muani scored in 79‚Äô. France would win 2-0 and advance to the final for the second World Cup in a row.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #France #Morocco \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n‚ñ∫FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n‚ñ∫PBC ON FOX‚Äôs YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n‚ñ∫WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n‚ñ∫NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n‚ñ∫CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer‚Äôs YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

When we think of an exotic state of matter we tend to think of the really weird things that matter can do in extreme circumstances - like how at very high temperatures we get the plasma that the sun is made of, or at extreme densities we get the nuclear matter of neutron stars.

This season's Battle Advisors include Charlie Puth (Team Camila), Jazmine Sullivan (Team Legend), Jimmie Allen (Team Blake) and Sean Paul (Team Gwen). For the first time ever, the third phase of the competition will include three-way knockouts.\n \nIn the Live Performance Shows, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast, and the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists.

The footage, originally posted to Twitter by a deleted account, showed Musk appearing caught off-guard as the crowd booed continuously, preventing him from getting a word in. 'Cheers and boos, I see,' said Chappelle in response to the crowd's reaction. 'It sounds like some of the people you fired are in the audience,' added the comedian shortly after.\n\nThe Guardian publishes independent journalism, made possible by supporters.
