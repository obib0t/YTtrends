{"description":"https://stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html\nhttps://curesarcoma.org/donate/\nhttps://giving.mskcc.org\n\n\nI didn't remember much on how I grew to love his content, but I remember knowing him through my brother. A few days before the Mr. Beast duel, I remember him asking me who would win. Me knowing Dream more than Techno, I had chosen the former, and my brother the latter. After that, I watched Techno's analysis of the duel, and his methods of telling a story in a witty humorous way is what captivated me and it just spiraled from there.\n\nI grew to love him even more during his grand entrance in the Dream SMP, and it just continued as he became one of the major characters in it and had impact the lore so greatly. I was so excited to draw him in my next animatic: 'The Fall', because I liked drawing him in the 'Techno vs Dream' animation, and more importantly, I can also continue the lore of Techno's hair design haha.\n\nOn November 16, after a huge lore stream, I tweeted out if any of the Dream SMP members could message me if they have any available clear audio that I can use. The only person who ever approached me was Technoblade, and was so considerate to make a separated recording of the entire stream which was so awesome!! Especially that so many people was just talking over his epic speech. What I find funny is that despite the recording having no game audio, and other people talking, I could hear the classic clicking of his keyboard that might have been louder than him in some moments.\n\nOn that same month, he became one of my patrons and I remember just fangirling so much. I didn't know how to thank him because I was still very anxious about messaging larger creators, thought my way of appreciating someone is through gestures. And so 'Hog Hunt' was made, which was pretty centric towards his character that he plays. I tried to be not as biased and give most of the members their moments, but this one's an exception haha.\n\nAfter that, I made a few MCYT animations and slowly fell out of the fandom, although I would rewatch some of his videos that I really liked, such as SBI related content, Potato War, and videos with Skeppy. I would look up in some of Techno fanarts because they had the most creative designs of his character and I'd love each and every one of them.\n\nDespite me slowly moving out of the fandom, he still continued to support me through patron. I did felt bad because of it, especially that he was going through a tough moment at that time. He did stopped, and it kind of felt weird that I was relieved. But I believed he needed it more than I do. That was the time I finally decided to send him a proper thank you message for everything he did. Not only did he supported me, but the rest of my family and my relatives.\n\nThat was a few weeks after the unfortunate news, I was having a break out of the internet loop, and so I had to hear it from my brother. I was in denial for 3 days and heck even now. I felt so regretful that I might not have thanked him soon enough. And yet I can't help myself but admire how despite what he had been through, he remained the cool, witty and funny person that he had always been even to the end. And the impact he left with everyone is now louder than ever. He had helped so many of his audience even if those actions can't be seen by many, he still helped so much anyways.\n\nSo with all that, let me say this again:\n\nTechnoblade, Thank you so so much. For the laughs. For the wits. For the skill. For the content. For the inspiration. For the community. For the friends we made. For the kindness. For everything.\n\nIf he ever read this, I bet he'd cringe. Good.\n\nFarewell.

Around Shuffled Shrines, you can find Symbols on the floor. There's one to the west (1), one north west (2), one north east (3) and one east (4).

He is doing this becuase it is rumored that the US mint is planning to stop making the penny starting in 2023. Once I saw his series titled “I Survived On $0.01 For 30 Days” I knew there was only one thing I needed to do. You see I have a habit of building the most insane builds on YouTube like transforming my bedroom into a cereal bowl, building Squid Game doll for MrBeast, and building giant boxing gloves for Jake Paul. That’s why I built Ryan Trahan the worlds largest penny to celebrate the completion of Ryan’s penny series which culminated with him delivering a penny to MrBeast. This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “Save the Penny!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Delivered a Penny to MrBeast, But I Survived On $0.01 For 30 Days, But How Ryan Trahan’s $0.01 Series Broke YouTube, But I Built Ryan Trahan The MrBeast Penny, But I Gave $100,111 To Ryan Trahan You Pick His Tattoo, But How Ryan Trahan changed YouTube with $0.01 or any other video like Ryan Trahan, MrBeast, Colin and Samir, Airrack, Paddy Galloway, Tyler Blanchard, Doctor Mike, Unspeakable or Preston would make.

Instead, the drill can plunge directly into the earth’s surface. From there, horizontal directional drilling is pretty straightforward, but it’s not necessarily straight. In fact, HDD necessarily uses a curved alignment to enter the earth, travel below a roadway or river, and exit at the surface on the other side.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

{"description":"Superliminal is a game based on forced perspective and optical illusions. This makes for one of the coolest speedruns, that may also break your mind\n\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\nWatch live at: https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nWatch the world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/vnL-jTGIUaE\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nSuperliminal description (from Steam):\n\nABOUT THIS GAME\nSuperliminal is a first-person puzzle game based on forced perspective and optical illusions. Puzzles in this game give you a sense of the unexpected. Players need to change their perspective and think outside the box to wake up from the dream.\n\nWAKE UP\nAs you fall asleep with the TV on at 3AM, you remember catching a glimpse of the commercial for Dr. Pierce’s Somnasculpt dream therapy program. By the time you open your eyes, you’re already dreaming - beginning the first stages of this experimental program.\n\nPERCEPTION IS REALITY\nExplore a dream world where everything is exactly as it seems. Tread carefully as the world slowly unravels around you and subverts your expectations. What you see isn’t always precisely what you get.\n\nMAN VS MACHINE\nIn this fully-voiced adventure, Dr Glenn Pierce is doing his questionable best to guide you home and out of the dreamscape. His artificial intelligence assistant, however, is having trouble understanding exactly how you’re here at all, and has other plans for you.\n\nDEVELOPER COMMENTARY\nWe’ve added an extensive developer commentary throughout the game, so you can learn the secrets and history behind the game’s development.\n\nCHALLENGE MODE\nThe overwhelming response from the speedrunning community to Superliminal inspired us to add a new Challenge Mode, which will score you per-level on metrics such as time to finish, grabs, and jumps.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP SUPPORT\nSuperliminal features Steam Workshop integration. Bring any 3D object into the game and play around with mind-bending perspective tricks.\n\n#EazySpeezy #Superliminal #Speedrun","title":"Superliminal speedruns might break your mind","duration":1237,"channel_id":"UCQSEAbOs6vsJfy7WN7iYaGQ","author":"EazySpeezy","date":"20220704","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wwn0AaF3tM4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Wwn0AaF3tM4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":668466}}

{"description":"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nBobby Carter | June 30, 2022\n\"We celebrate Black Music Month. This has been Black magic.\" Truer words may have never been spoken behind the Tiny Desk as R&B goliath Usher caps off our month-long celebration of Black music, highlighting a catalog chock-full of hits spanning 25 years. It's been over two years since NPR headquarters was abuzz with chatter of a legend in the building. After an early morning rehearsal for his set at the Something in the Water Festival in Washington, D.C., he made his way over to deliver an unforgettable performance.\n\nUsher and his band, all dipped in black, set it off with an introduction over a funky horn-laced instrumental reminiscent of a Blaxploitation flick. They keep that groove going right into a reworked version of his 1997 breakout single, \"You Make Me Wanna...\" Twenty-five years later, Usher sits arguably as the king of R&B. Between 2000 and 2010, there was no debate whatsoever, with his string of records that included the biggest R&B album of the 21st century, Confessions.\n\nWhat he's done in the vocal booth is only half of his claim to fame. The stage is where he's continued to shine as he prepares for the second leg of his Las Vegas residency. This loose and playful set touches on his many career phases; the crooning, the deeply personal, the club bangers and even the Tik Tok challenges indicate that he could just be reaching his prime. Recently, we've heard plenty of hot takes, wild battles and social media fodder about who sits at the mountaintop in the world of R&B. Usher Raymond has entered the chat.\n\nSET LIST\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\"\n\"Superstar\"\n\"U Don't Have to Call\"\n\"Nice & Slow\"\n\"Confessions Part II\"\n\"My Way\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nUsher: vocals\nEric Bellinger: vocals\nVedo: vocals\nDmitry Gorodetsky: bass\nLemar Guillary: trombone\nBrandyn Phillips: trumpet\nJay Flat: saxophone\nDarek Cobbs: keys\nErick Walls: guitar\nRyan Carr: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAudio Recording & Mix Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector: Kara Frame\nEditor: Michael Zamora\nSeries Creator: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Michael Zamora, Pierre Kattar, Alanté Serene\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Jill Britton, Joby Tanseco, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #usher #BMM","title":"Usher: Tiny Desk Concert","duration":1487,"channel_id":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","author":"NPR Music","date":"20220630","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8ODGFWgFg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/up8ODGFWgFg/hqdefault.jpg?v=62bcc32c","content":{"View count":5475084}}

The focus is on freedom, driving, exploration and immersion. It has minimal car maintenance and survival elements.\n\nInfinite Desert, Freedom and Driving:\nThere are no invisible walls or unable to jump over small fences, or blinking red \"wrong direction\" signs on the hud. The car won't need 10-20 liter fuel over just only a few hundred meters, with a full tank, you could go approximately 500 kilometers. If you see a distant big mountain, you can go there and if you are capable, you can climb it. If you don't like where the mirrors are facing you can adjust them however you want or throw them away while driving at full speed. If you want to lean out of the car, or closer to the radio or near anything, you can.","title":"I Turned a Fun Road Trip Into a Nightmare Voyage - The Long Drive","duration":1129,"channel_id":"UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q","author":"Let's Game It Out","date":"20220701","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88RAHxrQ33M","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/88RAHxrQ33M/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":2184524}}

{"description":"As of July 2022, I’m no longer working with Diamondback Bicycles. As I stated in the video the details of the matter are private. However, I can tell you that the split was 100% amicable. My time working with Diamondback was very fruitful, and their bikes have held up to an incredible amount of abuse here on Berm Peak and beyond. \n\nSince 2017, Diamondback Bicycles had been this channels bike sponsor. It’s common for YouTubers to have a bike sponsor now. Many creators are only able to go full time with the help of one or more sponsors, as was my case back in 2017. At that time, my arrangement with Diamondback wasn’t so common in the YouTube world, as I wasn’t a professional or competing in any capacity. This seemed pretty unthinkable at the time, but it turned out to be not so crazy. \n\nWe had some great years, Diamondback!
