For me, this moment came during the climax of the Pete Davidson film ‚ÄúThe King of Staten Island,‚Äù where his most important line was impossible to understand. \n\nI had to rewind three times ‚Äî and eventually put subtitles on ‚Äî to finally pick up what he was saying.\n\nThis experience isn‚Äôt unique ‚Äî gather enough people together and you can generally separate them into two categories: People who use subtitles, and people who don‚Äôt. And according to a not-so-scientific YouTube poll we ran on our Community tab, the latter category is an endangered species ‚Äî 57% of you said you always use subtitles, while just 12% of you said you generally don‚Äôt.\n \nBut why do so many of us feel that we need subtitles to understand the dialogue in the things we watch?\n\nThe answer to that question is complex ‚Äì and we get straight to the bottom of it in this explainer, with the help of dialogue editor Austin Olivia Kendrick.\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

This statement was inspired by the observation that so many aspects of the physical world seem to be describable and predictable by mathematical equations to incredible precision especially as quantum phenomena. But quantum phenomena have no subjective qualities and have questionable physicality. They seem to be completely describable by only numbers, and their behavior precisely defined by equations. In a sense, the quantum world is made of math. So does that mean the universe is made of math too? If you believe the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis then yes.

{"description":"Nicholaus Joseph Williams, better known by his stage name Trinidad James is a Trinidadian-American rapper. In 2012, he signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. The label dropped him in 2014 when he failed to release an album, although he continues to release music as an independent artist and is signed to Artist Publishing Group for songwriting.  \n\nIn this interview Marco starts off by asking who does Trinidad want to be? The interview starts very awkwardly as Trinidad has a bear mask on. Trinidad challenges Marco and says Marco brought him on the show to exploit him. The tables are turned as Trinidad seems to be trolling Marco and has him on his toes. Marco asks Trinidad to remove his mask and Trinidad asks Marco to tie his tie and in exchange Trinidad takes the tie and puts it on. Trinidad takes off his mask to reveal his face with one eyed made up. Marco gets into the interview asking why Trinidad hasn‚Äôt made any new music. Trinidad reveals that he wanted to know what the business of entertainment was about. Trinidad talks about his relationships with record labels. Trinidad goes deeper into relationships. Trinidad then goes into his various products and the meaning behind them. Trinidad asks Marco what he thinks about him. Trinidad and Marco go back and forth about the word ugly. The conversation speeds up and the two go back and forth. Marco‚Äôs phone goes off and Marco blames it on Matt the Producer. Matt the Producer enters and Trinidad and Matt get into a discussion that gets a little tense. Trinidad and Marco continue the interview. Marco asks Trinidad about his hair. Matt the Producer tells Trinidad to get out of Marco‚Äôs creative space. A lady enters from the backstage and Trinidad yells at the lady and Marco invites her on stage. She awkwardly exits and Marco attempts to end the interview as Marco exits while talking to Matt the Producer and the mics are hot. Trinidad throws his chair and goes under the ladder and Matt the Producer holds exception.\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n \nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @mattablespromotions\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @Breakbeatmedia @FunnyMarco\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube page, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com","title":"Trinidad James Talks Kanye, TIG, Def Jam, Painted Nails, Stage Fight","duration":1454,"channel_id":"UCYbvqjljebwzWVdTb9Fetiw","author":"Breakbeat Media","date":"20230118","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNfPcgFtVc","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NRNfPcgFtVc/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":564243}}

{"description":"A majestic creature to help you achieve a most noble victory, the Falcon Scout item is at your service! Deploy your Falcon Scout and control where it flies, ping or place markers, and caw to create a radius in which all opponents will be marked for your squad. You can also use your Falcon Scout to open containers and pick up loot. Carry the loot to yourself or a teammate and then scout for more!\n\nTo help you easily control your Falcon Scout, your view will shift to behind it. This may leave you defenseless if you‚Äôre not fighting in a team, so be sure to find a hiding spot if you‚Äôre battling solo. Also, be careful where you‚Äôre flying, as the Falcon Scout is vulnerable to enemy attack. (See its remaining Health in its Health bar.) Because the Falcon Scout is controlled remotely, there‚Äôs a max distance it can fly from you, trackable in its distance bar.\n\nFalcon Scouts are findable from the ground, regular Chests, Oathbound Chests, and Supply Drops. There‚Äôs no limit as to how many times you can use the same Falcon Scout in a match.\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode.

Get Surfshark VPN at¬†https://surfshark.deals/undecided - Enter promo code UNDECIDED for 83% off and 3 extra months for FREE!  Permanent magnets are a critical resource for renewables, because the generators in some wind turbines and motors in electric vehicles rely on them to run. A Floridian high school student has just shown us how to make a better electric motor without rare earth magnets. Another company is using cloud computing to try to improve electric motor performance ‚Äî also without rare earths. There‚Äôs some exciting advances being made when it comes to electric motors, but how much of a difference can they make?\n\nCORRECTIONS: \n09:40: Text should read 750 RPM. \nI've trimmed a couple of short sections from the video that were creating confusion.  I didn't mean to imply that AC motors use magnets, but the wording during some moments made it sound like I was.  Magnetless motors are not a new thing, but optimizing their design for high efficiency, high torque, without rare earths opens the door for more use cases.\n\nWatch How Can A Wind Turbine Be Motionless? https://youtu.be/OkRqVBpO2BQ?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7UWp64ZlOKUPNXePMTdU4d\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/why-this-17-year-olds-electric-motor-is-important/\n\nFollow-up podcast:\nVideo version - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-aWB84Bupf5hxGqrwYqLA\nAudio version - http://bit.ly/stilltbdfm\n\nJoin the Undecided Discord server:\nhttps://geni.us/undecided-discord\n\nüëã Support Undecided on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mattferrell\n\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Gear & Products I Like\nTesla and smart home gear:\nhttps://kit.co/undecidedmf\n\nGreat sustainable products for your home:\nhttps://geni.us/buildwithrise\n\nUndecided Amazon store front:\nhttps://geni.us/undecidedAmazon\n\nFun, nerdy t-shirts:\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedShirts\n\nAbstract Ocean Tesla Accessories:\n15% Discount - Code: \"Undecided\"\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedAO\n\nJeda Tesla Wireless Charger/USB Hub:\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedJeda\n\nTesla Referral Code:\nGet 1,000 free supercharging miles \nor a discount on Tesla Solar & Powerwalls\nhttps://ts.la/matthew84515\n\nVisit my Energysage Portal:\nResearch solar panels and get quotes for free!\nhttp://www.energysage.com/p/undecided/\n\nOr find community solar near you:\nhttps://communitysolar.energysage.com/?rc=p-undecided\n\n\nüëâ Follow Me\nTwitter \nhttps://twitter.com/mattferrell\nhttps://twitter.com/undecidedMF\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mattferrell\nhttps://www.instagram.com/undecidedmf\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/undecidedMF/\n\nWebsite\nhttps://undecidedmf.com\n\n\nüì∫ YouTube Tools I Recommend\nAudio file(s) provided by Epidemic Sound\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedEpidemic\n\nTubeBuddy\nhttps://www.tubebuddy.com/undecided\n\nVidIQ\nhttps://vidiq.com/undecided\n\n\nI may earn a small commission for my endorsement or recommendation to products or services linked above, but I wouldn't put them here if I didn't like them.

Other than that, the trailer looked really good. I think this will be the best Mandalorian season yet. \nI can't wait to see more of Grogu's experience with Order 66 and how all the Mandalorians unite to fight against the remnants of the Empire. I wonder what happens to Moff Gideon and the dark saber, as it seems Mando Din Djarin doesn't have it on his belt anymore.\n\nThank you for watching today's video.

{"description":"We Survived Antarctica... The Ice Planet. this was insane. There is nothing but snow, ice, mountains, and rock. We tried living in the wilderness. It was not what we expected.\n\nCash App: https://cash.app\n\nFollow my socials:\n‚ûΩ Twitter - @dream\n‚ûΩ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n‚ûΩ Snapchat - @dream\n\nMrBeast: @MrBeast \nKarl: @Karl \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nAfter years of being completely faceless online, I finally decided to do a face reveal, and after that my life completely changed. MrBeast took me to Antartica, and it was some of the craziest days of my life.\n\nAntarctica is nothing like anywhere else on earth. The sun never sets, the snow is deeper than you can dig, and the wind is hurricane-like at all times. You have to wear special gear to go outside, to avoid frostbite and also snow blindness. It felt like living on a different planet. The Ice Planet.\n\nAntarctica was incredibly cold, and surviving 50 hours in the wilderness was crazy. It was actually pretty fun, despite the fact I had 3 different illneses at the same time while I was there. I was constantly freezing and coughing, but I still managed to have fun. There were some scary moments, and lots of fun moments with my friends.\n\nBeing able to finally do this stuff in real life is awesome. I never would have thought in a million years that George, Sapnap and I would be traveling to Antarctica instead of filming another Minecraft Manhunt (maybe soon?!). I still want to do one in real life as well. Sorry for the lack of uploads!\n\nFun fact: Antarctica is the biggest desert on earth!\n\nMore Minecraft Survival soon... was kind of busy freezing...","title":"We Survived Antarctica...

The first game is my favourite of all time and I've bought the ps3 version, the ps4 remaster and even the ps5 remake that released a couple of months. This is a game I've completed numerous times on grounded mode and the series is something I've been desperate to do a deep dive on.\n\nThroughout this video we're gonna be breaking down the first episode scene by scene and talking about all the easter eggs, hidden details and what they did differently to the game. If you haven't played it then don't worry because we won't be spoiling what happens down the line as I want you to enjoy the twists and turns as much as I did on my first playthrough.\n\nHowever I may need to touch upon certain things due to characters that get name dropped here but I'll only bring them up in a spoiler section at the end of the video which I'll give you a heads up on.\n\ni'm nice like that\n\nNow unlike the game, the series starts off in 1968. Originally we watched as Sarah woke up in her bed and ventured about the house but here they do it differently. Rather than throwing us in at the night of the outbreak we get some backstory that wasn't even filled in in the source material. The game told us very little about the virus beyond it being cause by Cordyseps which had mutated to infect humans. These real life funghi exist in the jungle and the parasite infects insects and anthropods. Beginning in 1968 though we see a tv show in which two scientists do a big theory time about what the biggest threat to humanity is.\n\nThe first one goes off about how we may have a pandemic level event that's caused by a strain of influenza. Both games were made before Covid 19 and the creative team have kinda retroactively added this into the show to comment on it I think. The scientist mentions how airplanes are a new element that will help viruses like this spread easier and later on we see several planes flying overhead as Sarah, Joel and Tommy make their escape.\n\nThey add a lot of focus to them during the car scene and actually change up how the crash happens. Originally it was caused by another car hitting them but they do a fake out in the episode and instead have  plane debris causing it.","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 1 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":1960,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230116","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5XCOwFI9w8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5XCOwFI9w8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":561503}}

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe‚Äôve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we‚Äôre always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Driving a 47' Trimaran Off The Dock\n02:58 Busted Mainsail & Leaving Charleston, SC \n05:27 Open Ocean Sailing NEEL 47\n07:11 Flashback Airport - Surfshark.deals/WYNNS \n08:36 How Well Does a 47' NEEL Trimaran Sail?\n11:06 Sunset, Full Sails & Moonlight\n14:23 Sunrise & Dramatic Weather Swing\n16:35 Genoa, Pour Over Coffee & Breakfast\n19:11 Challenges With the Sails\n23:01 Sailing With Dolphins\n24:59 Beautiful Night Sailing with the Stars\n26:48 Sailing into Saint Augustine FL\n28:56 40 knot Squall, Boat Life: EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED\n33:11 Difference Between Land Life and Boat Life\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats #sailing  \n\n¬© Gone With the Wynns 2023","title":"NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED (rough start)","duration":2096,"channel_id":"UCBo9TLJiZ5HI5CXFsCxOhmA","author":"Gone with the Wynns","date":"20230115","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8x0VG1E8E0","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/S8x0VG1E8E0/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":349928}}
