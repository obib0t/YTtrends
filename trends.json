{"description":"Nice to see Coruscant again.\nFelt the ep dragged on too long with Pershing\nMando and Bo Katan are fun, Bo has ulterior motives to control the Mythosaur and rule Mandalore. \n\nAt pershing’s day job he tires to salvage some files from the empire that come across his desk, but he’s told to not do that and discard it. He thinks it’s ridiculous as the information can really help the new republic, but they simply refuse to do so. He’s getting angry at the new republic and beginning to resent them for sure. He grabs an imperial biscuit and we jump to him being questioned again by the robot with the same mundane questions. At the question of whether or not is he feeling resentment towards the new republic or not, he pauses, looks down, and rubs his ear. The same ear he rubbed when talking to the people in the opera chambers that he didn’t mean to do anything bad when working at the empire. The robot repeats itself, and he says no. Heading to G68 he says let’s continue the cloning work, and asks for her help to get the lab equipment. Immediately the plagueis theme plays and this is probably the biggest part of the episode for me, because it implies the ominous tone of palpatine telling anakin about plagueis in the opera. Does this mean they’ll bring plagueis back in star wars? Does this mean that it’s just a cool theme that’s supposed to make us think of betrayal and deceit? I guess we’ll find out.\nthey head to the train station and get to the scrapyards where the imperial star destroyers are held. This takes about 7 minutes of hopping trams to avoid ticket droid guards. Arriving at the junkyard…That’s where she’s taking him, to collect supplies from the ship, they enter and she introduces herself as Elia, and he as Dr Penn Pershing. Pershing gets to the imperial lab, grabbing what he needs, they hear a noise and vacate, only to be stopped by new republic police, where she grabs the case he just took from the ship for their mission, and gets him arrested. She set him up, framed him, and next we see him with some Mon Calamaris as he screams to them it was a trap, harkening to of course, admiral ackbar’s infamous line in return of the jedi. They set Pershing up to a mind flayer machine and the mon cala operator says it’s low voltage and not like a mind flayer, infact it’s used to heal, he says. Elia waits until the crew leaves as they turn the mind flayer on, and she cranks it up high, which erases his mind and memory. \n\nFinally getting back to Mando, they head to the armorer and the children of the watch where they’re hiding. Din tells Bo Katan to keep her helmet on as things will go smoother this way, since the clans have different beliefs. As they land, we see Paz Vizsla, who wanted to rule mandalore as he fought mando for it in the book of boba fett, losing, seems to be teeming with anger as he sees him land and bo katan with him. The history between Bo Katan and Pre Vizsla can be summed up like this. Bo and Pre Vizsla worked together under Death Watch, who believed that New Mandalorians \n\nlost their way of violence and conquering which was the way of the older mandalorians, so they waged civil war, until Bo felt he was a bit too crazy and left his group, rebelling against him. Paz Vizsla probalby sees her as a traitor and hates her.\nThe are approached by all the mandos there and Paz leads, telling them to leave as Din is no longer worthy of the mandalorian creed. He informs Paz Vizsla that he’s bathed in the living waters beneath the mines, as no one believes him. Bo Katan speaks up and says she was witness. And who are you, nite owl, says paz. Nite owls are just a faction of mandalorians led by bo katan after she left pre vizsla for his extremist ideologies. She announces who she is and he tells her that she’s lost her way, and both need to leave as they are apostates. Mando shows proof, so they send him up to the armorer, their leader, as she examines the vial of water sampled from the mines, and confirms indeed he has bathed in the waters, he is once again a mandalorian.\nShe says she too has joined the children of the watch since she bathed in the waters and hasn’t removed her helmet. I find it intersting the armorer knew right away that it was Bo Katan, this is very telling…that maybe the armorer knows who Bo is personally. Maybe the armorer, with her spikes on her head, or rather horns, was a member of the mauldalorians when darth maul ruled mandalore. I think she might be Rook Kast, who was loyal to Maul after he defeated her former leader, pre vizsla and organized the mandalorians against Ahsoka during the siege of Mandalore. That’d be wild since Bo and Ahsoka are friends and allies, and Rook Kast and Bo Katan are not. We’ll see who the armorer really is one day…\n\n\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/realswtheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join","title":"The Mandalorian Episode 3 BREAKDOWN PLAGUEIS!

{"description":"Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken - In Theaters This Summer\n\nSometimes the hero you are meant to be lies just beneath the surface. \n\nThis summer, DreamWorks Animation dives into the turbulent waters of high school with a hilarious, heartfelt action comedy about a shy teenager who discovers that she’s part of a legendary royal lineage of mythical sea krakens and that her destiny, in the depths of the oceans, is bigger than she ever dreamed. \n\nSweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. \n\nShe’s math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she’s prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar® nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. \n\nBut when she breaks her mom’s #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award® winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. \n\nThe Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There’s one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school’s beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt’s Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most. \n\nRuby Gillman, Teenage Kraken stars an extraordinary cast that includes Emmy winner Colman Domingo (Fear the Walking Dead) as Ruby’s supportive dad, Emmy nominee Sam Richardson (Veep) as Ruby’s enthusiastic uncle and Blue Chapman (Council of Dads) as Ruby’s cool little brother. \n\nDirected by Academy Award® nominated filmmaker Kirk DeMicco (Vivo, The Croods) and produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella (Trolls World Tour, Trolls), with Faryn Pearl (The Croods: A New Age, Trolls World Tour) serving as co-director, the film features a comedic powerhouse supporting cast, including Emmy nominee Will Forte (The Last Man on Earth), Emmy nominee Nicole Byer (Nailed It!), YouTube Diamond creator Liza Koshy (Liza on Demand), Ramona Young (Never Have I Ever), Eduardo Franco (Stranger Things) and Echo Kellum (Arrow). \n\nSocial Handles\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/teenagekrakenmovie  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/teenagekrakenmovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.teenagekrakenmovie.com \n#TeenageKrakenMovie","title":"RUBY GILLMAN, TEENAGE KRAKEN | Official Trailer","duration":144,"channel_id":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","author":"Universal Pictures","date":"20230316","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAMKwDsfUeU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iAMKwDsfUeU/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":361374}}

{"description":"Watch and you'll see, some day I'll be, part of your world! Watch the new trailer for #TheLittleMermaid and see the movie in theaters May 26!\n\nThe brand new soundtrack for Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” is available now to Pre-Save, Pre-Add or Pre-Order – https://presave.umusic.com/thelittlemermaidsoundtrack\n\n“The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) as the voice of Sebastian; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca”) as the voice of Flounder; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      \n \n“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”) with a screenplay by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”). The songs feature music from multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”) and lyrics by Howard Ashman, and new lyrics by three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), Miranda, two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), and Rob Marshall, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. \n\nHashtag: #TheLittleMermaid\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/littlemermaid\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyTheLittleMermaid\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneylittlemermaid/","title":"The Little Mermaid | Official Trailer","duration":141,"channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","author":"Walt Disney Studios","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpGo2_d3oYE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kpGo2_d3oYE/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":8220278}}

{"description":"Pilot Luke Czepiela lands an aeroplane on the world famous helipad on top of the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah, the iconic seven-star hotel in Dubai. To land on the helipad, 27m in diameter, he completed over 650 practice landings before the attempt on top of the 56-story hotel. He needed just 20.76 meters to stop. To make the feat possible he and a team of CubCrafters engineers along with renowned American aviation engineer and aircraft builder Mike Patey made a number of modifications to the aircraft, reducing the total weight to only 425 kilograms, moving the main fuel tank to the rear of the plane to allow for more aggressive braking and adding nitrous to enhance power for Czepiela’s secondary challenge – taking off from the helipad.\n\nTake flight with Luke and see even more from the landing here: https://www.redbull.com/bullseye-landing\n\n#RedBull #GivesYouWiiings #plane \n_________________________________________________\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before with the best action sports clips on the web, original series and livestreams.\n\nGet the FREE Red Bull TV apps for all your devices: http://win.gs/RedBullTVApps  \nSubscribe to Red Bull on Youtube: http://win.gs/SubToRedBull\nCheck out Red Bull on TikTok: https://win.gs/TikTok\nRed Bull on Facebook: http://win.gs/redbullfb\nRed Bull on Instagram: http://win.gs/RedBullInstagram\nRed Bull on Twitter: http://win.gs/redbulltwitter","title":"Landing A Plane On A Tiny Helipad (on top of a 7 Star hotel)","duration":133,"channel_id":"UCblfuW_4rakIf2h6aqANefA","author":"Red Bull","date":"20230314","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-brmk1ua1g","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/B-brmk1ua1g/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":841547}}

{"description":"Governments are rushing to reassure citizens that their money is safe, after the US saw its biggest banking collapse since the global financial crisis. Silicon Valley Bank's demise was closely followed by that of New York-based Signature Bank. The US insists a repeat of 2008 is not on the cards - but how contagious could the problems be?\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg released a joint statement Sunday that they will complete the resolution of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) whilst protecting depositors.\n\n\"Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThe reason authorities believe the taxpayer will incur no cost is that authorities administrating the bank will be able to use its remaining assets to cover the costs of reimbursing depositors.\n\nThe same will also apply to Signature Bank. On Sunday, the New York State Chartering Authority closed down the cryptocurrency-exposed lender that had lost around a third of its share price value in the second half of the week. \n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters on Sunday that he would speak at more length on the issue early on Monday.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#US #bankfailure #USregulators","title":"As another bank collapses, US regulators race to prevent spread of crisis I DW News","duration":475,"channel_id":"UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg","author":"DW News","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0Ilm230bf8","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a0Ilm230bf8/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":929555}}

First up though I wanna thank everyone for rocking with me the last 9 weeks and we're sort of like Joel and Ellie a bit because I'd doom the entire human race just to get a thumbs up from you.\n\nAnyway we start off the episode with a flashback and this features a major game cameo. Out in the woods we join a pregnant woman running and this is none other than Ashley Johnson. Ashley voiced Ellie in the game and here we catch her playing her mother. So far several big actors from the game have popped up including Tommy's voice actor as Perry, Troy Baker as James last week and Marlene's who shows up later on in this scene.\n\nEllies mother is called Anna and she was first mentioned in the last of us comic American Dreams.\n\nThis featured Ellie and Riley and in it we learned a little bit about Anna and what she did before the outbreak.\n\nAnna worked as a nurse before the outbreak and we know that she and her lifelong friend Marlene survived together when everything went down worse than this channels views next week.\n\nAll that we learned from the backstroy was that she died within a day of giving birth to Ellie but here we see it fleshed out with her running to a farmhouse being chased by an infected person. We can see a big symbol for the fireflies denoting that this is a safehouse and you can also catch what I'm guessing is the Boston QZ in the background. As we know this was controlled by Fedra and though we don't learn why Anna's out on her own like this it likely has something to do with the infected.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/","title":"THE LAST OF US Episode 9 Breakdown & Ending Explained | Review And Game Easter Eggs","duration":3025,"channel_id":"UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","date":"20230313","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2-Egs56y_I","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2-Egs56y_I/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":363344}}

{"description":"PRESS START. The final #SuperMarioMovie trailer is here! Tickets on sale now: https://uni.pictures/SMBGetTickets\n--\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\nOnly In Theaters April 5, 2023\n\nFacebook: https://uni.pictures/SMBFB\nTwitter: https://uni.pictures/SMBTW\nInstagram: https://uni.pictures/SMBIG\nTikTok: https://uni.pictures/SMBTT\nSite: https://uni.pictures/SMBSite\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/illuminationent\nhttps://www.facebook.com/illuminationent\nhttps://twitter.com/illumination\n--\n\nFor the first time, the iconic global entertainment brands Illumination and Nintendo join forces to create The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a new, big-screen adventure starring one of pop culture’s most prominent plumbers of the past four decades.\n\nBased on the world of Nintendo’s Mario games, the film invites audiences into a vibrant, thrilling new universe unlike any created before in an action-packed, exuberant cinematic comedy event. \n\nWhile working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt; Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi. \n\nWith the assistance of a Mushroom Kingdom resident Toad (Keegan-Michael Key; The Lion King) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy;The Queen’s Gambit), Mario taps into his own power. \n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an extraordinary comedic cast, including Jack Black (Jumanji films) as Bowser, Seth Rogen (Neighbors franchise) as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen (Portlandia, Saturday Night Live) as Cranky Kong, Kevin Michael Richardson (American Dad!, Family Guy) as Kamek and Sebastian Maniscalco (Green Book) as Spike, plus a special voice appearance by Charles Martinet, who has voiced the characters of Mario and Luigi in the Super Mario games for more than 30 years.\n\nThe film is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (collaborators on Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part). \n\nFrom Nintendo and Illumination—creator of the global blockbuster Despicable Me, Minions, Sing and The Secret Life of Pets franchises—The Super Mario Bros. Movie is produced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri p.g.a. and by Nintendo’s Representative Director and Fellow Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario, after more than six years of close bond and discussions between the two. The film is co-financed by Universal Pictures and Nintendo and will be released worldwide by Universal Pictures.","title":"The Super Mario Bros.

Be a flash of light with the sleek, aerodynamic “Victory Crown Rogue” (a.k.a. “Rogue Bike”). This two-person sports bike features high acceleration, sharp turning, and a boost-ready engine. Prefer a four-wheel ride? Get in the “Nitro Drifter” and use its handbrake to drift ‘round the bend.\n\nCome out swinging when you’re done swerving: acquire a “Kinetic Blade” and perform the artful “Knockback Slash.” Not holding back? Show no mercy and perform the devastating “Dash Attack.”\n\nThe streets aren’t the only way to get about MEGA City. Jump on its grind rails then skate around the buildings and your enemies. Even use your weapons as you ride!\n\nNeed a break from urban battle? Step foot on the fresh, teal-tinted grass of MEGA City’s surroundings.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #TearItDown #Recovery","title":"Quando Rondo - Tear It Down [Official Music Video]","duration":198,"channel_id":"UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","date":"20230309","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRWPouGltM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2QRWPouGltM/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":860791}}
