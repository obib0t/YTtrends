{"description":"TULSA KING follows New York mafia capo Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone), just after he is released from prison after 25 years and unceremoniously exiled by his boss to set up shop in Tulsa, Okla. Realizing that his mob family may not have his best interests in mind, Dwight slowly builds a \"crew\" from a group of unlikely characters, to help him establish a new criminal empire in a place that to him might as well be another planet. The series also stars Andrea Savage (\"I'm Sorry\"), Martin Starr (\"Silicon Valley\"), Max Casella (\"The Tender Bar\"), Domenick Lombardozzi (\"The Irishman\"), Vincent Piazza (\"Boardwalk Empire\"), Jay Will (\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\"), A.C. Peterson (\"Superman & Lois\") with Garrett Hedlund (\"The United States vs. Billie Holiday\").\n\nThe series will be executive-produced by Sheridan, Winter, Stallone, David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin and Allen Coulter.

{"description":"They’re fun. They’re also way more difficult to build than they seem.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nShipping container homes have been a trend for a while, from reality TV shows to housing policy discussions. But the truth is that these homes are a lot more difficult to build than you might think.\n\nIt’s easy to think that housing solutions are purely technological, but many obstacles to housing aren’t in construction but in the policies surrounding homebuilding. Moreover, many of the supposed advantages of shipping containers turn out to be more complicated in reality.\n\nVox’s Phil Edwards spent a night in a shipping container home to see how the experience of staying in a shipping container compares with the reality of building one.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nMark Hogan’s 2015 opinion piece about shipping containers is a great introduction to the topic: https://www.archdaily.com/773491/opinion-whats-wrong-with-shipping-container-housing-everything\nBelinda Carr’s debunking of shipping containers gets into more building science detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yEDz6bCfU\nShe’s also an even-handed critic and made a video about five shipping container successes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkG3gmPUPQg\nYou can check out Michael’s Airbnbs here: https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/329149776\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

{"description":"Used Vipers now cost the same as new GT3s. \n\nThe 2022 Porsche 911 GT3 Touring ($228,000 as specced in Canada, ~$180,000 USD converted) and the Dodge Viper GTS ($132,890 when new in Canada, ~$102,570 USD converted) are two absurdly riotous sports cars. A gruesome 8.4L V10 powers the Viper, pushing out 640 pure American horsepower and 600 lb ft of raw torque. The 4.0 L flat-six in the Porsche GT3 Touring screams its way to 9000 rpm, making 502 hp and 347 lb ft of torque - all while singing its own version of the German national anthem. Each car brings something unique to the table; Thomas and James are eager to see what makes each of these cars special. We hope you enjoy the episode! Thanks for watching!

{"description":"Like and subscribe if you enjoyed it!\n\nFollow me on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dreamcastguy\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dreamcastguy\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/dreamcastguy\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/DreamcastGuy\n\n#PS4 #PS5 #PlayStation \n\nThe new, more robust (and more complicated) PlayStation Plus is officially out in North America as of Monday. Sony’s new version of its subscription service now offers three tiers: Essential, Extra, and Premium.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Sony’s new subscription service play, you may be wondering: Is this PlayStation’s version of Xbox’s Game Pass? No, and, well, sort of. The higher-priced tiers do offer a catalog of new and classic games for subscribers, much like Xbox’s service. However, Sony has said it doesn’t plan to add new, first-party releases to PlayStation Plus the day they come out — a major Game Pass perk. The PlayStation Plus Essential tier is the version of PS Plus that’s existed for years. Subscribers will get access to monthly games, multiplayer access, discounts, exclusive content, cloud storage, share play, the PlayStation Plus Collection, game help, and free shipping from PlayStation. As it has been, a month will run players $9.99, a year is $59.99.\n\nThe PlayStation Plus Extra tier ($14.99 monthly/$99.99 yearly) is the enhanced version of the Essential tier. It comes with all the Essential features and only adds a game catalog of 400 first and third-party PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that subscribers can access — although selections will likely rotate in and out as the months go by.\n\nThe PlayStation Plus Premium tier ($17.99 monthly/$119.99 yearly) is the most enhanced version of PlayStation Plus and the most expensive. It comes with all the features in both Essential and Extra. It also adds a classic catalog of PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games, game trials for certain titles, and PlayStation 3 cloud streaming games.\n\nAs for the classic games emulation, American players are getting a better deal than other regions. When PlayStation started rolling out Premium in Asian territories a few months ago, its classic emulators were running the 50 Hz PAL versions of the game. However, in North America the titles are reportedly running the 60 Hz versions — which, practically speaking, means they’ll run faster for American players.","title":"The new PlayStation Plus is CRAZY!

Shawn wonders if the show is always the same and he wants to check it out again but us other 4 would not need to ever go back to this hotel although it is cool and I think worth doing it once if you 1. like cosplay 2. like Starwars 3. like roleplay and 4. don't mind subjecting your digestive system to LOADS nd LOADS of food coloring. :)  but definitely watch our RECAP review at the end of the vid.\n\n\n📚FGTeeV NY Times Best Selling Books:\n#1 FGTeev Into the Game ➡ https://amzn.to/3lBoPnB\n#2 FGTeeV Saves the World ➡ https://amzn.to/3laHoyA\n& FGTeeV Game Break➡ https://amzn.to/2T5QmRX\n\n🎮FGTeeV Games/Apps:\n🦍APE CHASE ➡ http://smarturl.it/ApeChase\n🔊SOUND BOARD ➡ http://smarturl.it/soundboard\n🧁GOOZY ➡ http://smarturl.it/goozy","title":"We Slept in Outer Space & Betrayed the Space People!

It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat.

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n #travel #travelvlog #sailing\n\n00:00 moving onto a sailboat!\n01:17 who are Riley and Elayna?\n02:15 taking over their boat for 24 hours!\n03:47 world’s best toothpaste 😁\n04:42 FULL TOUR of La Vagabonde ⛵️\n09:42 Van life vs boat life?\n10:25 Can we sail alone?!😱\n14:40 Lifting the anchor!\n16:29 hoisting the SAILS\n25:31 sunset beach bonfire 🔥\n26:27 learning to free dive and spearfish\n27:19 driving the dingy in the dark 🤦🏻‍♀️","title":"24 HOURS LIVING ON A SAIL BOAT (with sailing La Vagabonde)","duration":1762,"channel_id":"UC4ijq8Cg-8zQKx8OH12dUSw","author":"Kara and Nate","date":"20220611","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIY4PSilhb4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uIY4PSilhb4/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":913023}}
