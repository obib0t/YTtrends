Renowned since their inception for electrifying performances, The Rose quickly became one of Korea's most sought-after groups delivering a series of critically acclaimed albums that resonated with fans worldwide. In 2019, three of the band members temporarily went on hiatus to fulfill their mandatory military service obligations, during which WOOSUNG pursued a successful solo career, releasing captivating albums and embarking on sold-out world tours.\n\nIn a moment of sheer joy for their devoted fans, The Rose reunited during one of Woosung's performances in South Korea in 2022. This reunion paved the way for their first full-length album HEAL, which was inspired by the transformative power of music and the stories shared by both their fans and themselves. HEAL soared to #4 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, while their accompanying HEAL Together World Tour drew an overwhelming crowd of over 90,000 attendees.\n\nNow, with their highly anticipated second full-length album DUAL, The Rose takes their music to new heights. Building upon the emotional honesty and vulnerability showcased in HEAL, this latest offering explores the profound concept of 'balance.' Seamlessly merging light and dark elements, The Rose masterfully weaves emotions and sounds, capturing the dualistic essence that defines their music. \n\nDriven by unwavering dedication to their fans and the unbreakable bond of their friendship, The Rose continues to push artistic boundaries, captivating audiences worldwide with their soul-stirring music and unforgettable performances.\n\n더 로즈(The Rose)는 대한민국 인디 록 밴드이다. 보컬과 기타의 김우성(Woosung), 보컬 및 여러 악기를 다루는 박도준(Dojoon), 베이스의 이재형(Jaehyeong), 그리고 드럼의 이하준(Hajoon)으로 이루어진 이들은 2017년 데뷔, 화려한 라이브 실력으로 전세계 팬들에게 수많은 찬사를 받으며 대한민국에서 가장 인기 있는 밴드 중 하나로 떠올랐다. 2019년에 김우성은 솔로 앨범을 발매하고 성공적인 활동을 펼치며 솔로 월드 투어를 성황리에 마쳤다.\n\n2022년, 더 로즈는 3년 간의 공백기를 끝으로 첫 정규 앨범 ‘HEAL’로 컴백했다. 팬들과 함께 만들었던 이야기들과 음악의 힘에서 영감을 받아 제작된 'HEAL'은 빌보드의 히트시커스 차트에서 4위를 기록하였고, 'HEAL Together World Tour’는 9만 명이 넘는 관객들과 함께했다.\n\n이어서 두 번째 정규 앨범 'DUAL'로 돌아온 더 로즈는 한층 더 성장된 더 로즈의 음악적 스펙트럼을 보여준다. 'HEAL'에서 보여준 감정의 정직함을 이번 앨범에서 '균형'이라는 개념으로 탐구한다. 빛과 어둠의 사이에서, 더 로즈는 여러 사운드를 섞어내며 그들의 음악을 정의하는 이중성을 포착했다. 더 로즈는 예술적 경계를 끊임없이 넓혀가며 영혼을 뒤흔드는 음악과 잊지 못할 라이브 공연으로 전세계 음악 팬들을 사로잡고 있다.\n\n#TheRose #더로즈 #backtome","title":"The Rose (더로즈) – Back To Me | Official Video","duration":233,"channel_id":"UClcbcYLmTpDeuK1EFeqh5uA","author":"The Rose","date":"20230721","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuzLp9gDcwY","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fuzLp9gDcwY/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":3096570}}

{"description":"Step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Interstellar!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g\n\nChristopher Nolan has made a name for himself making intellectual mind-bendy movies with films like Memento, Inception and Tenet. Let’s just say it, the dude is a little obsessed with time. He’s one of the few filmmakers making truly “epic” movies, and it’s really cool when you can understand them.\n\nInterstellar definitely raises some questions though. Like why doesn’t anyone seem to care about Tom? Why did they decide to go down to that time dilation planet first? Why did they try to collect that worthless data? Why was there a Matt Damon jumpscare on the second planet? Why did Tom name his kid Coop Cooper? Why did Cooper send the same “stay” message that he knew did not get him to stay?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Interstellar!\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N5nQPNCNkg\n\nThe Flash Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzlSBBVpbS4\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PitchMeeting\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/","title":"Interstellar Pitch Meeting","duration":366,"channel_id":"UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g","author":"Pitch Meeting","date":"20230720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhHjhdwD8gk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/xhHjhdwD8gk/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":860938}}

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.\n\n---","title":"Chelsea 5-0 Wrexham | Extended Highlights | Chelsea FC USA Tour 2023","duration":608,"channel_id":"UCU2PacFf99vhb3hNiYDmxww","author":"Chelsea Football Club","date":"20230720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg8rrb2IxlM","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dg8rrb2IxlM/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":2370861}}

{"description":"A local favourite, an Amateur Champion and an afternoon exception lead the way after day one of The 151st Open as Tommy Fleetwood, Christo Lamprecht and Emiliano Grillo each shot a five-under-par 66 at Royal Liverpool.\n\nOn a day which started with Royal Liverpool member Matthew Jordan getting the action underway, the course at Hoylake proved a challenge for many – particularly those who found themselves in the afternoon groups. \n\nBut South Africa’s Lamprecht, making his Open debut just down the road from Hillside, where he won The Amateur Championship to qualify, showed no such struggles. \n\nWith his imposing 6’ 8” frame, Lamprecht mastered the narrow fairways, swerved the devilish bunkers and produced one of the shots of the round to take the clubhouse lead. \n\nHe was joined on five-under by Fleetwood, who managed his best opening round at The Open as he looks to lift the Claret Jug and win a first major. \n--\nVisit www.TheOpen.com for the greatest stories in golf\n\nKeep in touch with us!\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/The-Open-Championship/ \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/TheOpen \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/theopen/\nTo LICENSE The Open footage, please contact IMG REPLAY   ▶ https://bit.ly/306V7dI","title":"FULL ROUND HIGHLIGHTS | Day 1 | The 151st Open at Royal Liverpool","duration":612,"channel_id":"UCZ5fOnOmQunH18xZGhu9f_Q","author":"The Open","date":"20230720","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuBLh0ZfMtQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vuBLh0ZfMtQ/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":469275}}

How did the US go from having luxurious, widely used passenger trains to the Amtrak system we have today? \n\nVideo producer Dean Peterson makes a 72-hour journey on Amtrak from LA to NYC to show its current state of operation. From getting kicked in the head by his sleeping seat mate to taking in sweeping views of the desert at sunset, Dean shows the highs and lows of being stuck on Amtrak for days on end. \n\nAlong the way, he explains the history of passenger rail in the US — starting in the problematic robber baron era to the US government’s takeover of passenger rail. Will the United States ever catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to train travel, or are Americans stuck with an underfunded, inefficient rail network forever? Join Dean on his journey as he sets out to find out the answer to these questions and more.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Great Railroad Revolution by Christian Wolmar\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Great-Railroad-Revolution-History-America/dp/1610393473\n\nAmtrak, America's Railroad: Transportation's Orphan and Its Struggle for Survival (Railroads Past and Present) by  Geoffrey H.

While dad Mack is content to keep his family safe paddling around their New England pond forever, mom Pam is eager to shake things up and show their kids—teen son Dax and duckling daughter Gwen—the whole wide world. After a migrating duck family alights on their pond with thrilling tales of far-flung places, Pam persuades Mack to embark on a family trip, via New York City, to tropical Jamaica. \n\nAs the Mallards make their way South for the winter, their well-laid plans quickly go awry. The experience will inspire them to expand their horizons, open themselves up to new friends and accomplish more than they ever thought possible, while teaching them more about each other—and themselves—than they ever imagined. \n\nFrom a screenplay by Mike White, the Emmy winning creator of The White Lotus and the screenwriter of School of Rock, the film stars a top-flight comedic cast led by Oscar® and Emmy nominee Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick, Eternals) as anxious Mallard dad Mack and Emmy nominee Elizabeth Banks (Hunger Games and Pitch Perfect franchises) as Pam, the Mallards’ daring, quick-witted matriarch.\n\nCaspar Jennings plays Dax, the Mallards’ confident and restless son, and, in her feature film debut, Tresi Gazal plays Gwen, the family’s innocent and lovable daughter.\n\nGolden Globe winner Awkwafina (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) voices the scrappy leader of a New York City pigeon gang; Emmy winner and Oscar® nominee Carol Kane (The Princess Bride) plays Erin the heron, the first friend that the Mallards make on their journey; Emmy winner Keegan-Michael Key (The Super Mario Bros. Movie, The Lion King) voices a homesick Jamaican parrot locked away in a Manhattan restaurant, and BAFTA winner David Mitchell (Peep Show) plays the yogic leader of a mysterious duck farm. Legendary Emmy winner and Oscar® nominee Danny DeVito (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) co-stars as Mack’s curmudgeonly, adventure-averse Uncle Dan. \n\nDirected by Benjamin Renner, the Oscar®-nominated filmmaker of Ernest & Celestine and The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales, Migration is a visual spectacle unlike any in Illumination’s acclaimed history, featuring elevated, expressionist artistry and Illumination’s signature subversive humor and authentic heart, unforgettable characters and joyful soundtrack. \n\nProduced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri, Migration is a film about overcoming your fears and opening yourself up to the world and its opportunities. The film is co-directed by Guylo Homsy (Head of Layout and Cinematography for Sing and Sing 2), edited by Christian Gazal (Happy Feet, Peter Rabbit) and the Production Designer is Colin Stimpson (The Secret Life of Pets 2).","title":"Migration | Official Trailer","duration":192,"channel_id":"UCq7OHvWO6Z3u-LztFdrcU-g","author":"Illumination","date":"20230718","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQfo0HJhCnE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cQfo0HJhCnE/hqdefault.webp","content":{"View count":14355335}}

{"description":"Mike, Jay, and Rich Evans have returned again to the black void. Their reason today? To talk about a new huge summer blockbuster movie? No. Quite the opposite. They was gonna talk about Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 2: Dead Reckoning 1, BUT they thought… how many times can one see Tom Cruise do stints? No, this day Mike, Jay, and Rich have returned to the black void to talk about “Watchbait” the movie version of “Clickbait”. Trash that has overrun a once great institution like Tubi. And before you ask, no we wasn’t compensated by Tubi to promote these films. We were just browsing about and saw a trend. A trend of using certain words or phrases in a title to get one to click on their junk film to watch it, only to realize after a few minutes they made the worst mistake of their lives. This particular video wasn’t a Half in the Bag. Nor was it a re:View. Nor was it a Best of the Worst. I guess it could have been a “Talks About” video, but nah. We made a new show called “Beyond the Black Void” and if you ever see one of these again, it’s just Mike, Jay and Rich Evens talking about something of interest. In solidarity with the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strike we decided to talk about movies that in no way whatsoever could have possibly been made under any conceivable union agreement. In fact, I’d be shocked if one of these pictures weren’t some kind of nudie snuff film. Maybe that’s why Jay “downloaded all of them on his dark web server” whatever that means. And yes, it’s 100% true, we did just spring this whole thing on Rich Evans. I rang him up on my landline to tell him to come to the studio. Well, actually I left a message on his answering machine. He showed up coming from the gym where’s he’s done many power squats and asked me “What we shootin’ Mike?” and I tell him to sit down and shut up you shit-for-brains. He sits down, but there is an immediate squish sound. It would appear that Rich had soiled his large diaper. He claimed he didn’t know. He insisted he ONLY wears a diaper when he does power squats at the gym. 1. it helps stifle the sound of any accidental fart release, but also for… you know what. An accidental Hershey squirt. This is apparently what happened. Luckily a very large toddler had died outside our building and I was able to provide Rich Evans with replacement clothing. A lot went into this video. So please, enjoy.","title":"Beyond The Black Void - Watchbait","duration":1896,"channel_id":"UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA","author":"RedLetterMedia","date":"20230718","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeMadjM0ZZI","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UeMadjM0ZZI/hqdefault.jpg","content":{"View count":661122}}
